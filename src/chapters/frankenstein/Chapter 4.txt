LINE 1: From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the
LINE 2: most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
LINE 3: I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,
LINE 4: which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the
LINE 5: lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the
LINE 6: university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense
LINE 7: and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive
LINE 8: physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In
LINE 9: M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by
LINE 10: dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and
LINE 11: good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways
LINE 12: he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse
LINE 13: inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at
LINE 14: first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and
LINE 15: soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the
LINE 16: light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.
LINE 17: As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress
LINE 18: was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and
LINE 19: my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,
LINE 20: with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman
LINE 21: expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years
LINE 22: passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was
LINE 23: engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I
LINE 24: hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive
LINE 25: of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as
LINE 26: others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
LINE 27: a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
LINE 28: A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
LINE 29: infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
LINE 30: continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was
LINE 31: solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
LINE 32: years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical
LINE 33: instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the
LINE 34: university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well
LINE 35: acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
LINE 36: depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my
LINE 37: residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought
LINE 38: of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
LINE 39: happened that protracted my stay.
LINE 40: One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was
LINE 41: the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
LINE 42: life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
LINE 43: It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a
LINE 44: mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
LINE 45: acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
LINE 46: inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
LINE 47: thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
LINE 48: natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been
LINE 49: animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this
LINE 50: study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the
LINE 51: causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became
LINE 52: acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I
LINE 53: must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
LINE 54: In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
LINE 55: mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever
LINE 56: remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared
LINE 57: the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and
LINE 58: a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
LINE 59: life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become
LINE 60: food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of
LINE 61: this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
LINE 62: charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most
LINE 63: insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the
LINE 64: fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of
LINE 65: death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm
LINE 66: inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and
LINE 67: analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
LINE 68: from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
LINE 69: darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and
LINE 70: wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity
LINE 71: of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so
LINE 72: many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
LINE 73: science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
LINE 74: secret.
LINE 75: Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not
LINE 76: more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is
LINE 77: true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the
LINE 78: discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of
LINE 79: incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of
LINE 80: generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing
LINE 81: animation upon lifeless matter.
LINE 82: The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery
LINE 83: soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in
LINE 84: painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the
LINE 85: most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so
LINE 86: great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been
LINE 87: progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.
LINE 88: What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation
LINE 89: of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it
LINE 90: all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a
LINE 91: nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them
LINE 92: towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already
LINE 93: accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead
LINE 94: and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
LINE 95: ineffectual light.
LINE 96: I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes
LINE 97: express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with
LINE 98: which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end
LINE 99: of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that
LINE 100: subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,
LINE 101: to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my
LINE 102: precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
LINE 103: knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town
LINE 104: to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature
LINE 105: will allow.
LINE 106: When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated
LINE 107: a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
LINE 108: Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to
LINE 109: prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of
LINE 110: fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
LINE 111: difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the
LINE 112: creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
LINE 113: imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to
LINE 114: doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful
LINE 115: as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared
LINE 116: adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should
LINE 117: ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
LINE 118: operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
LINE 119: imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes
LINE 120: place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present
LINE 121: attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor
LINE 122: could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any
LINE 123: argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I
LINE 124: began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts
LINE 125: formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first
LINE 126: intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,
LINE 127: about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having
LINE 128: formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully
LINE 129: collecting and arranging my materials, I began.
LINE 130: No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like
LINE 131: a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death
LINE 132: appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and
LINE 133: pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless
LINE 134: me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
LINE 135: owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his
LINE 136: child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these
LINE 137: reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless
LINE 138: matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)
LINE 139: renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.
LINE 140: These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking
LINE 141: with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
LINE 142: person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very
LINE 143: brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the
LINE 144: next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone
LINE 145: possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon
LINE 146: gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
LINE 147: eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive
LINE 148: the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps
LINE 149: of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless
LINE 150: clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but
LINE 151: then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
LINE 152: to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was
LINE 153: indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
LINE 154: acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had
LINE 155: returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and
LINE 156: disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
LINE 157: frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
LINE 158: and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
LINE 159: I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
LINE 160: their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The
LINE 161: dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
LINE 162: and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
LINE 163: whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I
LINE 164: brought my work near to a conclusion.
LINE 165: The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
LINE 166: one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
LINE 167: bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant
LINE 168: vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the
LINE 169: same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
LINE 170: to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had
LINE 171: not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I
LINE 172: well remembered the words of my father: "I know that while you are
LINE 173: pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall
LINE 174: hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any
LINE 175: interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties
LINE 176: are equally neglected."
LINE 177: I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings, but I could
LINE 178: not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which
LINE 179: had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it
LINE 180: were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection
LINE 181: until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,
LINE 182: should be completed.
LINE 183: I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
LINE 184: to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was
LINE 185: justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from
LINE 186: blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
LINE 187: peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
LINE 188: disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge
LINE 189: is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself
LINE 190: has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for
LINE 191: those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
LINE 192: study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
LINE 193: mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit
LINE 194: whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
LINE 195: affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his
LINE 196: country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the
LINE 197: empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.
LINE 198: But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
LINE 199: tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.
LINE 200: My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my
LINE 201: silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
LINE 202: Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not
LINE 203: watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always
LINE 204: yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my
LINE 205: occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near
LINE 206: to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had
LINE 207: succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared
LINE 208: rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other
LINE 209: unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
LINE 210: Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most
LINE 211: painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow
LINE 212: creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at
LINE 213: the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone
LINE 214: sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and
LINE 215: amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself
LINE 216: both of these when my creation should be complete.
