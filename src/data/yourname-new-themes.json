This place, Itomori, is a\ndinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either\nknow each other or at least know someone in common.\n\"Here are the morning announcements from Itomori.\"\nThe slow stream of words from the speaker is clipped into phrases. \"Here\nare...the morning anno uncements... from Itomori.\" There are speakers\noutside, too, all over town, so the broadcast echoes off the mountains and\noverlaps with itself as if it's being sung in rounds.\nTwice a day, morning and evening, this disaster-prevention radio broadcast\nplays throughout the town. Every house has a receiver to faithfully relay the\ndaily announcements about local events: the schedule for the sports meet, how\nto contact whoever's in charge of shoveling the snow, yesterday's births,\ntoday's funerals.\n\"With regard to the Itomori mayoral election, which will take place on\nthe twentieth of next month, the town election management committee\nhas\u2014\"\nClick.\nThe speaker over the lintel falls silent.

Even as I'm impressed by\nher chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.\nPicking up where Saya's sister left off, the smiling NHK news lady starts\nspeaking.\n\"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only\nonce every twelve hundred years. For a few days, the comet is expected to be\nvisible to the naked eye.

Just make up with him already, wouldja?\"\nOut of nowhere, Yotsuha says something tactless.\n\"It's an adult problem,\" I snap at her.\nThat's right\u2014this is an adult problem. Stupid election!

This is the origin of the term tasogare, or\ntwilight. You know the word twilight, don't you?\"\nSpeaking in a clear voice, our teacher, Miss Yuki, writes Tasokare in big\nletters on the blackboard.\n\"It's evening, not quite day or night. It's a window when outlines blur,\nmaking it hard to tell who people are. When you might meet something that\nisn't human. It's a time when people encounter demons or the dead, and it has\nanother name that reflects this. They say, though, that even before that, it had\nother names.\"\nMiss Yuki writes the two terms on the board, but it looks like she's just\nshuffling around the same letters.\n\"'Scuse me, teacher! Question! What about half-lightl \"\nSomebody speaks up, and I think, Yeah, that's right. I know twilight, of\ncourse, but the word I've heard people use to mean evening ever since I was\nlittle is half-light. When Miss Yuki hears this, she smiles gently. You know,\nour classics teacher is much too pretty to be teaching at a country high school\nlike this.\n\"I expect that's local dialect, isn't it? I hear the elderly people in Itomori\nstill use ancient Japanese words here and there.\"\n\"'Cause this here's the sticks,\" proclaims one of the boys, and people start\ngiggling. He's not wrong. Sometimes Gran uses words that make me want to\nask her what language she's speaking. Some of her expressions were\nabandoned by most of the rest of Japan a couple of centuries back. Idly\npondering, I flip through my notebook, and then\u2014on a page that should be\nblank\u2014I see something written in big letters:\nWho are you?\n...Huh?\nWhat is this? The sounds around me fade and grow distant, as if being\nabsorbed by the unfamiliar handwriting. That's not mine. I haven't lent my\nnotebook to anybody, either. What? \"Who am I?\" What's that supposed to\nmean?\n\"...zu. You're next, Miss Miyamizu!\"\n\"Oh! Yes'm!\" I stand up hastily.\n\"Begin reading on page ninety-eight, please,\" Miss Yuki tells me.\nScrutinizing my face, she adds, sounding amused, \"Good to see that you\nremember your name today, Miss Miyamizu.\"\nAt that, the whole class bursts out laughing. Excuse me? Seriously, what is\ngoing on?!\n\"You don't remember?\"\n\"...No.\"\n\"For real?\"\n\"Yes, for real,\" I answer, taking a sip of banana juice. Gulp. Yum. Saya's\nlooking at me as if I'm some inanimate oddity.\n\".. .No, listen. Yesterday, you forgot where your desk and your locker were.\nYour hair was all mussed and cowlicky, and you hadn't tied it back. You didn't\nwear your uniform ribbon, and you were crabby the whole time.\"\nI try visualizing what that must've looked like.What?\n\"What?! No way, are you serious?!\"\n\"Yeah, you acted like you had amnesia or somethin' yesterday.\"\nFlustered, I try to think back... Something really is off here. I can't\nremember yesterday. Or, no\u2014I do remember little bits and pieces.\nThere was.. .an unfamiliar town somewhere?\nA reflection in a mirror.. .a boy?\nI try to retrace my memories. Piihyororooo. In the distance, a kite mocks\nme. It's lunchtime, and we're chatting in a corner of the schoolyard, juice\nboxes in hand.\n\"Umrn... It feels like I spent the whole day in this weird dream. Like...a\ndream about somebody else's life? .. .Mm, I can't remember much of it...\"\n\"I got it!\"\nTesshi shouts all of a sudden, and I jump. He snatches up his half-read issue\nof the occult magazine MU and shoves it under our noses, spit flying\nenthusiastically.\n\"Memories of your past life! That's what that is! Yeah, I know you're gonna\nsay that ain't scientific, but if you put it another way and say your unconscious\nmind got linked up with a multi verse based on Everett's many-worlds\ninterpretation\u2014\"\n\"You shut your piehole,\" Saya scolds him sharply.\n\"Hey! Were you the one who scribbled in my notebook?!\" I erupt at almost\nthe same time.\n\"Huh? Scribbled?\"\nOh, I guess not. Tesshi's not the type to pull a lame prank like that, and he\ndidn't have a motive, either.\n\"Um, nothin'. Never mind,\" I say, backing down.\n\"Say what? Whaddaya mean, 'scribbled'? Ami a suspect for somethin'?\"\n\"I told you, forget it.\"\n\"Whoa, Mitsuha, you're so mean! Did you hear that, Saya? I've been\nfalsely accused! Framed! Call a prosecutor, gimme a prosecutor! Or wait,\nmaybe that's a lawyer. Hey, which one are you supposed to get for stuff like\nthis?\"\n\"Anyway, Mitsuha, you really were kinda funny yesterday,\" Saya says,\ngrandly ignoring Tesshi's complaints. \"Were you feelin' sick?\"\n\"Hmm... That's so weird. Maybe I really am stressed...\"\nI think back on all the accounts I've gotten so far.\nTesshi's already absorbed in his magazine again, as if nothing ever\nhappened. That's one of his virtues, the way he just lets stuff go.\n\"That's gotta be it! You've had all kinds of stress lately!\"\nShe's right. Even setting aside the election, that ritual's tonight! Why, oh\nwhy, in this tiny little town, do I have to have a father who's the mayor and a\ngrandmother who's the chief Shinto priestess at the shrine? I bury my face in\nmy knees and heave a deep, deep sigh.\n\"Aaagh... I wanna hurry up and graduate and go to Tokyo. This town is too\ncramped and too tight!\"\nSaya's nodding along: I know. I totally, totally get it! \"My mom and my\nsisters have all been in charge of the town broadcasts, one after another. Ever\nsince I was tiny, the neighborhood ladies have called me 'the little broadcast\ngirl,' you know?! And now I'm in the broadcastin' club for some reason! Even\nI don't know what I want to do anymore!\"\n\"Saya, once we graduate, let's get out and go to Tokyo together! Even when\nwe're grown up, in this town, we'll still be stuck with the school hierarchy!\nWe'll never be free of these moldy old traditions! C'mon, Tesshi, you're\ncornin' with us, right?\"\n\"Hmm?\" Absently, Tesshi looks up from his magazine.\n\".. .Were you even listenin'?\"\n\"Mm. I don't really, uh... I think I'll just live here for the rest of my life.\"\nHAAAAAAAAH. Saya and I sigh again. This is why he isn't popular with\ngirls...

      "text": "This time every year, the Miyamizu Shrine holds its harvest festival, and\nYotsuha and I have the misfortune of being the stars of the show. On this day,\nwe wear crisp shrine maiden outfits, paint on bright-red lip rouge and wear\njingly hair ornaments, go out in front of the standing audience at the kagura\nhall, and dance the dance Gran taught us. It's one of the traditions whose\nmeaning was lost in the fire, and it's performed by two people, moving in sync.\nWe're both holding bells with colorful cords tied to them. We ring them,\ntwirling around and around, making the cords flare out and trail behind us.\nDuring my last spin, I spotted Tesshi and Saya out of the corner of my eye and\ngot even more depressed. Those little\u2014 I told them and told them not to come,\nand they're still here?! I'll hex them with my shrine maiden power! I'll text\nthem tons of curse stamps with Line! That said, the dance isn't the part I hate.\nSure, it's a little embarrassing, but since I've been doing it since I was little,\nI'm completely used to it. No, it's not this. It's that one ritual. The one that's\nmore embarrassing the older I get. That thing I have to do right after this. The\npart that seems intentionally designed to brutally humiliate women.\nOh, for the love of\u2014\nI don't wanna!\nPlagued by these thoughts, I move my body, and then all of a sudden, the\ndance ends. Agh. Here it comes.\nMunch, munch, munch.\nMunch.\nMunch, munch, munch, munch.\nI'm intently chewing rice. I shut my eyes and keep chewing, trying not to\nthink, trying not to sense flavor or sound or color. Beside me, Yotsuha's doing\nthe exact same thing. We're kneeling formally, side by side, and a small\nwooden box rests on a stand in front of each of us. And of course, beyond that,\na diverse audience of all ages and genders stares at us.\nMunch, munch, munch.\nMunch, munch.\nAgh, I swear...\nMunch, munch, munch.\nI'm going to have to do it soon.\nMunch, munch.\nArrrgh.\nMunch.\nGiving up, I raise the box in front of me. I bring it close to my lips,\nattempting to veil my mouth with the sleeve of my kimono.\nAnd then. Aaagh.\nPuckering my lips, I spit the rice I've been chewing into the box. The\nmixture of grain and saliva dribbles from my mouth as a thick, white liquid. I\nfeel as if I've heard the crowd stir, muttering. Waaaaaaaaah! I sob internally.\nPlease, nobody look at me.\nMouth-brewed sake.\nIt's the oldest type of sake in Japan. If you chew up rice, mixing it with\nsaliva, then just let it sit, it ferments and turns into alcohol. Then it's offered to\nthe gods. Long ago, I hear places all over the country used to make it, but I\ndon't know if any other shrines still do this sort of thing now, in the twenty-first\ncentury... And seriously, doing it in shrine maiden clothes is just over the top!\nI mean, what's the point?! Mentally sniffling, I pick up another pinch of rice\nand put it in my mouth like a trooper. Then I chew again. Yotsuha is doing the\nexact same thing, her expression cool and composed. We have to do this over\nand over until the tiny boxes are full. Dribble... I spit saliva and rice again.\nInside, I'm crying my eyes out.\nAbruptly, my ears catch familiar voices. Feeling a bad premonition like a\nfaint ripple, I raise my eyes ever so slightly.\nCurses.\nI want to explode and take the shrine with me. I knew it: It's my three flashy\n\"in-crowd\" classmates. They're watching me with smirks on their faces and\ngleefully gossiping about something. There's too much distance between us for\nme to really hear them but I feel as though I'm hearing them loud and clear.\nEeeeee, I could never, ever do that! and That s kinda obscene, and Man, how\ncan she do that in public? Nobody's ever gonna marry her now.\nI make a very, very firm resolution:\nWhen I graduate, I am leaving this town and going far away.\n\"Cheer up, Sis. Who cares if people from your school saw you? And\nanyway, what's got you so shook up?\"\n\"It must be nice being a carefree, prepubescent little kid!\"\nI glare at Yotsuha. We've changed into T-shirts and just left the shrine office\nentrance.\nAfter the harvest festival, to close out the night, the two of us attended a\nbanquet for the local men and women who helped with the festival. Gran was\nthe hostess, and Yotsuha and I poured sake and made conversation.\n\"How old are you now, li'l Mitsuha? What?! Seventeen?! I see... Havin'a\nsweet young thing like you pour for me makes me feel young again. \"\n\"Yessir, go on and roll the years way back! Here, go ahead\u2014drink some\nmore!\"\nWe entertained almost desperately, wore ourselves out, and they finally\nturned us loose just now, saying, \"You kids can go on home.\" Gran and the\nother adults are still at the shrine office, carrying on with the banquet.\n\"Yotsuha, do you know what the average age was back there, in the office?\"\nOn the grounds, all the lights on the shrine approach are out, and the cool\nsounds of insect songs echo all around us.\n\"I dunno. Sixty?\"\n\"I did the math in the kitchen. It was seventy-eight. Seventy-eight!\"\n\"Huh.\"\n\"Now that we're gone, it's ninety-one in there! They're pushin' a hundred.\nThey're in the final stage of life. The underworld might send a reaper for the\nwhole place!\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that we should bail on this town ASAP, but\nYotsuha's response is terse. She seems preoccupied with something else. Well,\nshe's just a little kid. She wouldn't understand her big sister's agony. Giving\nup, I look at the sky. The vast expanse of it is filled with dazzling bright stars,\nshining transcendentally, as if human lives on Earth are none of their concern.\n\"...That's it!\"\nAs we descend the shrine's long stone stairway, side by side, Yotsuha\nsuddenly cries out. She's wearing a triumphant expression, as if having found a\ncake someone hid from her.\n\"Sis, why don't you chew up a whole bunch of that sake and use it to pay\nyour way to Tokyo?!\"\nFor a moment, I'm speechless.\n\".. .You've got quite the mind to come up with that.\"\n\"You could send snapshots and 'makin' of' documentary videos with it and\ncall it 'Shrine Maiden Sake' or somethin'! I bet that'd sell!\"\nShould I be worried that my nine-year-old sister sees the world like that?\nStill, I realize Yotsuha is actually concerned about me, in her own way. Aw, she\nreally is cute, I think, a little more fondly than before. Okay then, maybe I'll",

His cheeks are lean, with clean lines, and for some\nreason, there's a big bandage on one of them. When I touch it gingerly, there's a\ndull throb.\n\u2014But. Even though it hurts, I don't wake up.

There are photos and design sketches\nof bridges and buildings and structures all over the walls. The floor is a\ncareless mess of magazines and paper bags and cardboard boxes. Compared to\nthe Miyamizu house, tidy as a venerable old Japanese inn (all thanks to Gran),\nthis place seems wild and lawless. The room is really small\u2014probably a\ncondominium. If this is my dream, I have no idea where it came from, but I'm\nimpressed by how real it seems. I guess I've got a pretty good imagination.\nMaybe I could be some kind of artist when I grow up.\nTweedle!\nA text alert echoes from the depths of the hall with such impeccable timing\nthat it seems like a comeback.

Get over here, run!\nTsukasa\nHuh? What? What's this? Who in the world is Tsukasa?!\nAt any rate, I guess I have to go to school. I scan the room. My eyes stop on\na boy's uniform hanging beside the window, and as I pick it up, I'm suddenly\naware of another emergency.\nOh, for the love of...!\nI need to pee.\nHaaaaaah. I heave a sigh nearly strong enough to deflate my whole body.\nWhat is wrong with guys' bodies, anyway?!\nI managed to do my business somehow, but I'm still shaking with anger.

Or is this guy weird?! Arrrgh! I'd never even seen\none of those before! And excuse me, but I'm technically a shrine maiden!\nAfter I change into the uniform, keeping my head bent from the awful shame\nand fighting back tears (I can't actually fight them all back, and a few slip out),\nI open the condo's door.

The sky is a\nvivid cerulean blue, without the slightest blemish. On the border between the\nblue and green, ranks of buildings of all sizes line up neatly, like extra-intricate\norigami. Each and every one is stamped with minute, exquisite windows like\nthe mesh of a net. Some of the windows reflect blue, others are tinted green,\nand still others simply glitter in the morning sun. I can see a red tower, tiny\nwith distance, and a silver building whose rounded lines remind me vaguely of\na whale, and a shining black building that looks as though it's been cut from a\nblock of obsidian. I'm sure these buildings and several of the others are\nfamous\u2014even I recognize some of them. Far away, little toy cars flow in neat,\norderly lines.\nIt's the scenery of the biggest city in Japan, and compared with what I'd\nimagined, it's\u2014 Actually, come to think of it, I've never really tried to\nvisualize what it would be like before, but it's much, much more beautiful than\nit looks in the movies and on TV It hits me hard, right in the chest.\n\"Tokyo,\" I murmur.\nThis world is far too dazzling. I inhale deeply and squint, as if looking at\nthe sun.\n\"Hey, where'd you buy this?\" \"In Nishi-Azabu, on the way home from\nlessons.\" \"Guess who's gonna be opening for their next big concert?\" \"Yo,\nwanna skip club today and go catch a movie?\" \"An agency employee is coming\nto the mixer tonight.\"\nWh-what's with these conversations?

Maybe they're just reading posts off some celebrity's\nFacebook page?\nI watch the classroom from where I'm standing, half-hidden behind the\ndoor, timing my entrance. I used my smartphone's GPS to get here, and even\nthen, I got incredibly lost. By the time I found the school, the lunch bell was\nalready chiming away.\nStill, this school\u2014 Glass windows that take up entire walls, bare concrete,\ncolorful iron doors with round windows... It's so abnormally fancy, I have to\nwonder whether it's a World Expo venue or something. This Taki Tachibana\nguy, a boy my age, lives in a world like this? I think of his name, which I found\nin his student handbook, and his smug expression on his ID photo. They annoy\nme a little.\n\"Taaaki!\"\nSomebody abruptly throws an arm around my shoulders from behind, and I\ngive a wordless yelp. When I look, a bespectacled CEO-type (only neat and\nsophisticated) is smiling at me, close enough that our bangs are almost\ntouching. Eeeeeek! 'Scuse me, mister\u2014this is the closest I've ever been to a\nguy in my life!\n\"Look at you, showing up at noon. Let's go eat.\"\nWith that, the kid with glasses sets off down the hall, still hugging my\nshoulders. No, seriously, you're way too close!\n\"Ignore my text, will you?\" he accuses, but he doesn't sound mad. Then I\nfigure it out.\n\".. .Excuse me... Wait, Tsukasa?\"\n\"Ha-ha, 'excuse me'? Do I detect a note of contrition?\"\nI don't know how to respond to that, so for the moment, I quietly extricate\nmyself from his arm.\n\"...Yougot lost?\"\nTakagi\u2014a big, good-natured guy\u2014shouts, not bothering to hide his\nastonishment.\n\"How the heck did you manage to get lost on the way to school?\"\n\"Um...\" I falter. The three of us are sitting in a corner of the wide rooftop.\nIt's supposed to be lunchtime right now, but there aren't many people around.\nMaybe they're avoiding the summer sun.\n55\n\"Oh, um, 'scuse me\u2014\n'\"'Scuseme'?\"\nTakagi and Tsukasa eye each other dubiously. Oops, that's right: I'm Taki\nTachibana now.\n\"Uh, I mean, um... Oh. Pardon me...?\"\n\"Hunh?\"\n\"Sorry.\"\n\"Say what?\"\n\".Whatever?\"\nUh-huh, they nod, still looking bewildered. I see, so he's the \"whatever\"\ntype. Got it!\n\"I was just enjoyin' myself a little. Tokyo's kinda like a festival. Real\nlively.\"\n\".. .What's with the accent?\" asks Takagi.\n\"Huh?!\" I have an accent? I turn red.\n\"Taki, where's your lunch?\" Tsukasa prods.\n\"Huh?!!\" I didn't bring one!\nAs I hunt through my school bag, sweating bullets, they laugh. \"Do you have\na fever or something?\"\n\"Tsukasa, you got anything?\"\n\"Egg sandwich. Let's stick that croquette of yours in here.\"\nHere. The two of them hand me the improvised egg-croquette sandwich.\nTheir kindness touches my heart.\n\"Thank you...\"\nThey both grin at me wordlessly. To think boys could be so stylish and\nkind...!

Who's laughing now, bus\nstop cafe?!\nTwo tiny dogs dressed in pop idol-style outfits are sitting on a wicker\nchair, watching me with eyes like candy drops and wagging their tails so hard\nthey seem liable to come off. There's an incredible amount of space between\neach table, and fully half the customers are foreign. A third are wearing\nsunglasses, three-fifths are wearing hats, and not one is wearing a suit. There's\nno telling what any of them do for a living.\nWhat is this place? Adults go to cafes with their little dogs on weekdays, in\nbroad daylight?!\n\"I like the timberwork on the ceiling.\"\n\"Yeah. They put serious effort into that.\"\nTsukasa and Takagi don't seem the least bit intimidated by this supremely\ntrendy space. They're smiling and discussing their impressions of the interior.\nApparently, these boys are touring different cafes because they're interested in\narchitecture. What kind of hobby is that?! Aren't high school guys into\nmagazines like MU7\\\n\"Taki, do you know what you want?\"\nPrompted by Tsukasa, I stop dissecting the cafe and let my eyes fall to the\nheavy, leather-bound menu.\n..! I\u2014I could live for a month on how much these pancakes cost!\"\n\"What era are you from, again?\" Takagi laughs.\n\"Umm...\"\nI stress about it for a little while and then remember: Oh. Right. This is a\ndream. Well, in that case, why not? It's Taki Tachibana's money anyway. I'll\njust eat whatever I want.\nAhhhh, what a great dream...\nThe pancakes are the heavyweight kind, a fortress solidly flanked by things",

How am I supposed to know to respond to \"boy,\" huh?\nWow. The man's an obvious thug, complete with open-collared shirt, gold\nchain, and lots of clunky rings. Still, if you go to the next city over from my\ntown, there are a lot of guys like him hanging out in front of the station. His\ntype feels a little more familiar to me than the celebrity-esque luster of the\nother customers. When he speaks, there's a thin smarm in his voice:\n\"Listen. There was a toothpick in my pizza.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nMr. Thug picks up the very last slice of basil pizza with his fingertips.\nThere's a toothpick sticking out of the edge where it was sliced, basically\nscreaming that someone jabbed it in there after the fact. Maybe he's joking\naround with me. I'm bewildered, unsure how to respond, and Mr. Thug\ncontinues with a seemingly fixed smile.\n\"It woulda been bad if I'd eaten that, right? We're just lucky I noticed it.\nWhat're you gonna do?\"\n\"Huh...?\"\nI get the feeling I really can't afford to say, You really stuck that in there\nyourself right, sir? I give a noncommittal smile instead... Conversely, his\nfades.\n\"I'm asking you what you're gonna do about it?!\"\nCrash! All of a sudden, he kicks the table up with his knee and starts\nyelling. Instantly, the murmur of conversation freezes. I tense up, too.\n\"\u2014Sir! Is something the matter?\"\nA woman appears and pushes me out of the way. She glances at me and\nwhispers, \"I've got this!\"\nSomeone else grabs my arm from behind and drags me away\u2014a waiter\nwho's probably worked there longer than me. \"You're acting pretty weird\ntoday,\" he says, looking concerned.\n\"I'm terribly sorry about that, sir!\" Out of the corner of my eye, I see the\nwoman bowing deeply to the thug.\nThe background hum returns, as if someone's twisted the volume backup.\nI'm pushing an industrial vacuum cleaner that's as big as a lawn mower\nover the floor. The restaurant's finally closed. The lights in the chandeliers\nhave dimmed, and all the tables have been stripped. One employee polishes\nglasses, another checks the stock in the refrigerator, and somebody else is\ndoing something with the computers at the cashier counter.\nThe woman who rescued me is wiping down the tables one by one. For a\nlittle while now, Fve been trying\u2014and failing\u2014to find an opportunity to speak\nto her. Her long hair has a soft wave to it. From the side, it hides her eyes, and\nI can't read her expression. Still, her lustrous, glossy lips are curved into a\ngentle smile. Her arms and legs are slender, and her waist is very small\u2014and\nyet she's got big boobs. She's just incredibly cool somehow. Passing her, I\ncatch a glimpse of the name tag on that proud bosom. It reads Okudera.\nPerfect!\n\"Miss Okudera?\"\nJust as I take the plunge and speak, somebody pokes me in the back of the\nhead.\n\"That's senpai to you!\" The guy who poked me sounds like he's joking. He\ngoes back into the kitchen, a stack of menus in one hand. I see, so she's got\nseniority on me. Okay!\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai! That was really...\"\n\"Taki. You had a rough day today, didn't you?\"\nAs she speaks, she turns and looks me right in the eye. Her long eyelashes\ncurve toward the ceiling, her perfectly shaped almond eyes are the epitome of\nbeauty, and her sexy voice sends a tickle down my back. I instinctively feel\ncompelled to tell her I love you! My cheeks flush a little, and I hastily look\ndown.\n\"Uh, no, it wasn't really 'rough,' just...\"\n\"That guy was totally full of it. I handled it according to the manual and let\nhim have his food for free, but...\"\nShe doesn't seem all that angry. She flips the rag over and starts wiping\ndown another table. Just as I'm about to try to prolong the conversation...\n\"Eek! Okudera-senpai!\"\nAnother waitress cries out.\n\"Your skirt!\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nMiss Okudera twists to inspect her rear, and her face rapidly flushes. Now\nthat I'm looking, I can see a rough, horizontal slash just above her thigh. With a\nshocked little shriek, she pulls her apron around to hide the tear.\n\"Are you hurt?\"\n\"Geez! Nasty. Was it that one dude?\"\n\"I think something like that's happened before...\"\n\"Was someone harassing you?\"\n\"Do you remember the guy's face?\"\nSeveral staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.\nEyes downcast, she's gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the\nwords I'd prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I\nsee little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.\nThis time, I need to rescue her.\nThe thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I'm doing,\nI've grabbed Okudera-senpai's hand and started walking. I hear voices at my\nback (\"Hey! Taki, you little...\"), but I ignore them.\nThe green can be a field. The orange is flowers and butterflies. I want at\nleast one more design element. The brown is\u2014 Sure, it'll be a hedgehog. The\ncream is for its nose.\nPinching the edges of the tear in the skirt, I deftly whipstitch it together. For\nsome reason, there were several colors of embroidery thread in the changing\nroom sewing kit, so I'm taking the opportunity to make this a bit of an elaborate\nrepair job. Gran trained me in needlework, and it's something I'm particularly\ngood at.\n\"All done!\"\nI hand the skirt to Miss Okudera. It's only taken me about five minutes to\nfinish.\n\"...Huh? This is...\"\nThe dubious expression she's worn since I dragged her to the dressing\nroom quickly shifts to surprise.\n\"This is amazing! Taki, wow! It's even cuter than it was before!\"\nThe tear in the skirt was a straight, horizontal line about six inches long, so\nas I stitched it together, I turned it into a scene of a hedgehog playing in a field.\nThe skirt is dark brown, so the little decoration acts as an accent, my thought\nbeing a cute motif would look especially good on a sophisticated beauty like\nOkudera-senpai. She has an even-featured, gorgeous, magazine-model face, but\nwhen she smiles, she's more approachable, like an older girl from the\nneighborhood.\n\"You really saved me today. Thank you very much.\"\nI finally managed to say it.\n\"Heh-heh!\" Okudera-senpai's large eyes narrow softly when she smiles.\n\"To tell you the truth, I was a little worried back there. You're weak, Taki, but\nyou're always so quick to fight.\"\nAs she speaks, her slim fingers lightly tap her left cheek. Oh. Vaguely, I\ngrasp the reason for the bandage on Taki Tachibana's face.\n\"I like this version of you better,\" Okudera-senpai says, a bit\nmischievously. \"You're surprisingly in touch with your feminine side, Taki.\"\nMy heart leaps with a bo-yo-yoing. Her smile is absolutely unbeatable. It\nmakes me want to give her everything I have for free. I think it's the most\nprecious thing I've seen in Tokyo today.",

Almost every ten\nsteps, the aromas change. I never knew human beings had such pronounced\nsmells when gathered in one place.\nAnd for every lighted window that skims past my vision, there's a person\nliving in this city. My heart is strangely stirred by the ranks of buildings that\nstretch as far as the eye can see, by their dizzying numbers and the\noverwhelming weight of them, almost like a mountain range.\nTaki Tachibana is one of the residents here, too. Softly, I extend a hand\ntoward the boy reflected in the train window. His face annoyed me a little, but\nI guess I don't hate it. I'm starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy,\nas if he's a fellow soldier who endured this rough day with me. But you know\n\"Y'know, this is a really impressive dream, if I do say so myself.\"\nBack at his house, I throw myself onto the bed where I woke up this\nmorning.\nI'll tell Tesshi and Saya about all this tomorrow: Listen to this dream 1\nhad!

I bet I'm gonna be a manga artist\u2014or no, wait,\nI'm not so great at art, but I bet writin' novels would be a cakewalk. I'll\nprobably make a ton of money! You wanna be my roommates in Tokyo?\nFantasizing about this and grinning to myself, I roll over onto my back, pick\nup Taki Tachibana's smartphone, and start skimming through it with my\nfingertip. Oh look, he keeps a diary\n[9/7 Ate at KFC with Tsukasa and Co.] [9/6\nMovie in Hibiya] [8/31 Architecture Tour\u2014\nBayside Edition] [8/25 Payday!]\nAs I scroll backward through the headers, I'm impressed in spite of myself.\n\"He's real thorough.\" Then I tap the photo app. Most of the pictures are\nlandscapes. After those, the majority are of him with Tsukasa and Takagi.\nEating ramen together, going to the park together... They sure are close. A beet\nbowl place, a soba shop at the station, a trendy hamburger joint. The road\nhome from school. Sunset through the gaps between the buildings. His friends'\nbacks. Jet contrails in the sky overhead.\n\"Lucky him, livin' in Tokyo...\"\nAs I murmur, a yawn slips out. Starting to get sleepy, I go to the next photo.\n\"Oh, it's Okudera-senpai.\"\nThe picture is of her back as she's cleaning the restaurant window, and it\nfeels like a candid shot. In the next, she's noticed and turned to face the\ncamera, beaming and flashing a peace sign.\n...Maybe he likes Okudera-senpai , I think out of nowhere. It's bound to be\nunrequited, though. She's in college. To her, high school guys are still just kids.\nI sit up on the bed and create an entry in his diary app. Then I start typing in\neverything I experienced today. About how I made a lot of mistakes but\nconnected with Okudera-senpai at the end. About how, on the way home from\nwork, we walked from the restaurant to the station together. I capture all of it in\nthe entry, wanting to report it\u2014or brag about it\u2014to Taki Tachibana. Once I'm\ndone, I yawn again. Then, out of nowhere...\nWho are you?\nFor some reason, I remember the line scribbled in my Japanese notebook.\nVaguely, I can picture Taki Tachibana in my body, writing that note in my room\nin Itomori before he falls asleep. What a bizarre idea. Still, there's something\noddly persuasive about it. I take a felt-tip marker from the desk, and on the\npalm of my hand, I write:\nMitsuha\nYaaaawwn...\nThat's the third yawn. Unsurprisingly, today wore me out. It was a colorful,\nthrilling day. It feels as if I spent all of it getting pelted by a rainbow-colored\nshower. Even without background music, this world dazzled me from start to\nfinish. I imagine how startled Taki Tachibana's going to react when he sees the\nwriting on his hand, and, smiling a little, I fall asleep.",

She greets us with a smile, strappy sandals\nclicking pleasantly.\n\"Hello, everyone.\"\n\"Hi!\"\nShe's sort of an idol at this place, and confronted with her stunning\npresence, the four of us reply in unison. For a moment, we almost forget about\nour problem. Then Okudera-senpai turns back and looks right at me.\n\"Let's make it another good day. Okay, Taki?\"\nI can almost hear a heart symbol punctuating that sentence, so sweetly\ndelivered, followed by a wink sent my way before she disappears through the\ndoor. I turn so red, it's like somebody dumped boiling water over my head.\nThis is way too much. I want to go polish all the glasses in the restaurant until\nthey shine, right this minute.\n\".Hey. Taki.\"\nThe guys' voices are so dark it's as though they're resounding from the\ndepths of the Earth, and I come back to myself with a jolt.\n\u2014Not good. As the senior staff cross-examines me, almost wailing, I\nwonder:\nWhat's going on here? Are they pranking me? Is everybody in on it? ...\nNah, couldn't be. What'd I do while I was out of it?\nWhat the heck is \"Mitsuha \"?\nThe birds are energetically twittering away again this morning. There's a\nnewborn clarity to the early sun that streams in through the paper sliding doors,\nand the morning is peaceful, as usual. Even so, although I've just woken up,\nunfamiliar writing with a quality of pure, concentrated irritation is scrawled\nacross my arm.\nMitsuha??? What are you? Who are you????\nThe letters are big and messy, written roughly with a super-thick Magic\nMarker, from my palm all the way up to my elbow.\n\"Sis, what is that?\"\nWhen I look up, Yotsuha's standing in the open sliding door. I make a face\nthat says, That's what I want to know.\nMy little sister's face replies, Well, it doesn't really matter.\n\"You're not feelin' up your boobs today, huh? Break! Fast! Time! Hurry\nup!\"\nShe shuts the sliding door with a sharp clack , just like always, and I watch\nher from my futon. Huh? Boobs? I'm \"not feeling them up today\"? ...Excuse\nme? My mind produces a gratuitous image of myself happily squeezing my own\nboobs... B-but that's so perverted and gross!\n\"Mornin'!\" I say as I enter the classroom.\nThe minute I do, all my classmates' eyes are on me. Eep! I give a little\ngasp. Wh-what? Trying to make myself small and inconspicuous, I cross to my\nseat by the window. I hear whispers.\n\"Miyamizuwas really cool yesterday, huh.\"\n\"Uh-huh. I didn't think she had it in her.\"\n\"Her personality's kinda changed, though, yeah?\"\n\"U-um, people are lookin' at me...\"\n\"Well, what did you expect? After what you pulled yesterday, they can't\nhelp it,\" says Saya.\n\"'What I pulled yesterday'?\" I ask, sitting down.\nSaya peers into my face, looking puzzled and worried.\n\u2014You know.. .durin' art yesterday, when we were sketchin' that still life.\nHuh? You really don't remember? Again? Honestly, Mitsuha, are you okay?\nYou and me were in the same group. We were supposed to be drawin' the vase\nand the apples\u2014y'know, the subject that doesn't make any sense. Except you\nsketched a landscape instead. Well, that bit doesn't matter. Anyway,\nMatsumoto's group was behind us, and they were talkin' nasty, the way they\nalways do.\nWhat, you want to know? Um, well, about the mayoral election.\nHuh? Details? Oh, you know, how the town administration is all just\nfigurin' out how to hand out subsidies, and it's the same no matter who does it,\nbut how there are \"some kids\" whose livelihood depends on it, et cetera.\nDumb stuff like that. When you heard them, you said, \"That's me they're talkin'\nabout, right?\" So I said I thought it probably was. I mean, if you ask me, I'm\ngonna answer, right? Then, Mitsuha, what do you suppose you did?\nYou seriously don't remember? You kicked the desk with the vase on it\nright toward Matsumoto's group! And with a great big grin on your face!\nMatsumoto and the others got scared, and of course, the vase broke, and the\nwhole class went dead quiet. Actually, you gave me the chills, too!\n\"Wh-wh-what in the world?\"\nI turn pale. After school, I run straight home. Yotsuha and Gran are in the\nliving room, drinking tea without a care in the world. Glancing at them out of\nthe corner of my eye, I run up the stairs, shut myself in my room, and open my\nclassics notebook. Who are you? it still reads. I turn a few more pages.\nMy skin crawls. Now there's a whole two pages filled with small letters in\nthe same handwriting. First, in big letters, Mitsuha Miyamizu. Then there are\nlots of question marks around it and bits of personal information about me.\nYear 2, Class 3 / Teshigawara friend, occult geek,\ndumb but a good guy / Sayaka \u00a3, friend, quiet, kinda\ncute\nLives with her grandma and her little sister Yotsuha /\nWay out in the sticks / Her dad is mayor / She's a shrine\nmaiden? / Sounds like her mom is dead / Her dad\ndoesn't live with them / Doesn't have many friends /\nHas boobs\nThen, in larger letters, What the heck is this life??\nI stare at the notebook. I'm trembling. The scenery of Tokyo shimmers in my\nmind, as faint as a rising haze. Cafes, a part-time job, guy friends, walking\nhome with someone...\nA corner of my heart catches the tail of an impossible conclusion.\n\"Is this...? Could we be...?\"\n\"Is this seriously...?\"\nI'm holed up in my room, staring at my phone in denial. For a while now,\nmy fingers have been shaking as if they partly belong to somebody else as I\nscroll through the entries in my journal app. Sandwiched between the ones I\nwrote, there are several headers I don't remember.\nFirst y Harajuku-Omotesando panini-rama! / At\nOdaiba aquarium with two boys / Observation\nplatform tour and flea market^ / Visited father's\nworkplace Kasumigaseki District!\nA corner of my mind catches the tail of an inconceivable conclusion.\nCould this be...?\nIn my dreams, are this girl and I\u2014\nIn my dreams, are this boy and I\u2014\n\u2014switching bodies?!",

The birds in the morning, the hush at midday, the\ninsect songs in the evening, the glitter of the night sky.\nThe sun rises between the buildings. Little by little, the daylight glints oft\ncountless windows. The throngs of people in the morning, the hum of midday,\nthe scents of everyday life at half-light, the sparkle of the streets at night.\nOver and over, we're captivated by moments like these.\nAnd, gradually, we learn.\nTaki Tachibana\u2014Taki\u2014is a high school kid my age who lives in Tokyo,\nand...\nAt irregular intervals, unexpectedly, two or three times a week, I swap\nbodies with Mitsuha Miyamizu, who lives way out in the sticks. It triggers\nwhen we fall asleep. We have no idea what causes it.\nOur memories of the time we spend switched fade as soon as we wake up.\nIt feels like a lucid dream.\nEven so, we're definitely swapping. The reactions of the people around us\nprove it more than anything.\nNow that we're aware that we are actually switching with each other,\nwe're starting to hold on to bits of memories from the dreams. For example, at\nthis point, even when I'm awake, I know there's a boy named Taki who lives in\nTokyo.\nNow I'm positive there's a girl named Mitsuha living in a country town\nsomewhere. I don't have any solid evidence or rational explanation, but I have\nthis strange sense that tells me it's real.\nWe've also started communicating with each other. On the days when we\nswitch, we leave diary entries or notes on each other's smartphones.\nWe've tried texting and calling, too, but for some reason, neither of us\ncould get through. Anyway, we're lucky we figured out a way to communicate\nat all. We both need to keep each other's lives intact and undisturbed... So we\nset rules.\n<To Taki\u2014Don'ts List #1>\n\u2022 Absolutely no baths, ever.\n\u2022 Do not look at or touch my body.\n\u2022 When you sit, keep your legs together.\n\u2022 Don't get too friendly with Tesshi. Try to get\nhim and Saya together.\n\u2022 Don't touch other boys.\n\u2022 Don't touch the girls, either.\n<To Mitsuha\u2014Don'ts List Ver. 5>\n\u2022 I told you before, don't waste my money.\nRemember?\n\u2022 Don't be late for school or work. Learn how to\nget there already.\n\u2022 Don't talk with an accent.\n\u2022 Are you sneaking baths? I think I smell\nshampoo...\n\u2022 Don't get cuddly with Tsukasa, you idiot.\nPeople will get the wrong idea.\n\u2022 Don't get too friendly with Okudera-senpai, I'm\nbegging you.\n\u2014But still... I grit my teeth reading another of Mitsuha's journal entries.\nReading Taki's entry in my diary, my blood starts to boil. Honestly, I swear,\nthis is just completely...\nThat guy...\nis such a...!\nThat girl...\nYou \"tore up the court\" playing basketball in\ngym?! That's not me at all!

I'll\nget to put in some more time on the cafe project I'm working on with\nTeshigawara after school. Yeah, and also\u2014\nI sit up on the futon and look down at my body.\nMitsuha's pajamas have gotten really conservative lately. She used to sleep\nin a baggy nightshirt without a bra. This morning, though, she's wearing\nunderwear that's kinda constricting and this shirt that's buttoned up all the way.\nThere's no telling when we're gonna swap, so she's being careful. Well, I get\nthat. I do. But.\nI reach for her breasts. This is my body today. Nothing wrong with\ntouching my own body, I think, just like always. Only. Except. But...\nMy hands pause, and I mutter quietly:\n\".. .Guess I shouldn't.\"\nThe sliding door rattles open.\n\".You really do like your boobs, don't you. Sis?\"\nThat's all the little sister says before closing the sliding door. I watch her\ngo.. .while kneading my breasts.\n.. .This is okay, right? From on top of her clothes. Just a little.\n\"Graaaaan. Why's the body of our shrine's god all the way out here?\"\nYotsuha whines.\nGran, who's walking in front of us, answers without turning around.\n\"Thanks to Mayugorou, I don't know, either.\"\nMayugorou?\n\".. .Who's that?\" I whisper to Yotsuha, who's plodding along next to me.\n\"Huh? Youdunno? He's famous.\"\nFamous? I don't really get how these relationships work in the country.\nThe three Miyamizu women\u2014me, the grandma, and Yotsuha\u2014have been\nhiking mountain roads for almost an hour already. Today, they tell me, we're\ntaking an offering up to the body of their shrine's god on top of the mountain.\nThese people are living in a folktale , I think, thoroughly impressed.\nThe sun shining through the canopy of maple leaves dyes them bright red.\nThe air is crisp and dry, and there's a strong scent of dead leaves in the\npleasant wind. October. Who knows when it happened, but it's full autumn in\nthis town now.\nCome to think of it, I wonder how old this old lady is.\nThe thought comes to me gazing at the small back ahead of me. Even on this\nmountain trail, she's wearing traditional clothes. She's a surprisingly strong\nwalker, but her back has a textbook stoop, and she's using a walking stick. I've\nnever lived with an old person, so I can't even begin to guess her age or what\nkind of shape she's in.\n\"Hey, Grandma!\"\nI break into a run, then kneel in front of her, offering my back. After all, this\nlittle old lady is raising Mitsuha and her sister, and she always packs us really\ngood lunches.\n\"Let me piggyback you. If you want...\"\n\"Oh, may I?\" Even as she speaks, she's happily lowering her weight onto\nmy back. I catch a distinct whiff of a mysterious fragrance I smelled once at\nsomebody else's house a very long time ago. For a moment, I get a strange,\nwarm feeling, as if this moment has happened before. The old lady weighs\nnothing.\n\"Grandma, you're way light\u2014 Whoa!\"\nThe moment I stand, the added cargo buckles my (Mitsuha's) knees.\nYotsuha hastily supports me, complaining, \"Come on, Sis!\" Come to think of it,\nMitsuha's body is pretty flimsy and thin and light, too. Moving through the\nworld this way.. .it's kinda amazing. The thought gets to me a bit.\n\"Mitsuha, Yotsuha.\"\nI hear the old lady's voice over my shoulder, sounding serene.\n\"Are you familiar with musubiT '\n\" MusubiT '\nYotsuha asks the question from beside me. She's hugging my backpack to\nher stomach. Below us, through the gaps between the trees, I can see the whole\nround lake. We've climbed pretty high. Mitsuha's body is all sweaty from\nclimbing with her grandma on her back.\n\"In the old language, our local guardian deity is called Musubi, 'creator of\nspirits.' It's a word with several very profound meanin's.\"\nGuardian deity? Where'd this come from all of a sudden? Still, the old\nlady's voice is like something out of the Manga Japan Folktales program, and\nit's oddly persuasive.\n\"Did you know?\" she starts again. \"Joinin' threads is called musubi. Joinin'\npeople is also musubi. The passage of time is musubi , too. They all use the\nsame word. It's a name for our god, and the god's power. It describes the\nbraided cords we make, divine acts, and the flow of time itself.\"\nI can hear the murmur of running water. Must be a stream around here, I\nthink.\n\"Cornin' together to form a shape, twistin' and tanglin', sometimes cornin'\nundone, breakin' off, then reunitin'. That's a braided cord. That's time. That's\nmusubi .\"\nWithout really meaning to, I visualize a stream of clear water. It runs up\nagainst rocks and splits, mingles with others, joins up again, and, seen as a\nwhole, it's all connected. I don't really understand what the old lady's saying,\nbut I feel as if I've learned something very important. Musubi. Even after I\nwake up, I'll make sure to remember that word. Sweat drips off my chin,\nfalling to the ground with a distinctive plop, and is absorbed into the dry\nmountain.\n\"Here, drink up.\"\nWe take a short break in the shade. The old lady hands me a thermos.\nIt's nothing big, just sweetened barley tea. Even so, it's shockingly good,\nand I drain two cups in a row. \"C'mon! Me too!\" Yotsuha pesters. This may be\nthe best drink I've ever had.\n\"That's another musubi.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nAs I hand the thermos to Yotsuha, I involuntarily look over at the old lady.\nShe's sitting at the base of a tree.\n\"Puttin' anythin' in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also\ncalled musubi. Did you know that? What you put in your body binds to your\nsoul, you see. And so, the offerin' we're makin' today is an important tradition\nmeant to connect the god and humans to each other, a custom that the Miyamizu\nfamily has observed for centuries.\"\nBefore I notice, the trees end, and the lake town below us\u2014now about the\nsize of a sketchbook\u2014is half-hidden beneath the clouds. When I look up, the\nwisps of cloud still overhead seem paper-thin, transparent and shining.\nThey're flowing rapidly into the distance and dissolving in the strong wind.\nWe're in a rocky area where only moss grows. We've finally reached the peak.\n\"I see it, I see it!\"\nYotsuha's skipping around. I catch up to her and follow her gaze. Ahead,\nthere's a crater-like basin about the size of an athletic field, as if the top of the\nmountain has been gouged out. The inside is a green, marshy area, and near its\ncenter stands a massive, solitary tree.\nI'd never even imagined a view like this one, and I stare.\nIt's almost like a natural floating garden. You'd never be able to see it from\nthe town. The boondocks are all kinds of awesome.\n\"This is the edge of the other side,\" the old lady says.\nWe've gone down to the basin floor, and there's a little brook flowing in\nfront of us. The big tree is beyond.\n\"Other side?\" Yotsuha and I say together.\n\"The hidden world, the next world.\"\nThe next world. Grandma's folktale voice strokes my back like a cold\nwind. My feet falter just a little. A sacred mountain, or a power spot, or a save\npoint\u2014whatever it is, the atmosphere saturating it really does seem to belong\nto some other world.\nThis better not be one of those places that doesn't let you leave once you go\nin.\n\"Yaaaay, it's the next world!\"\nYotsuha whoops and splashes across the little stream. Kids are really\nsomething, all dumb and full of energy. Well, the weather's nice, and the wind\nand the brook are both peaceful. I'd probably be embarrassed later if I got cold\nfeet over something like this. I take the old lady's hand so she won't get wet,\nand we cross the brook on the stepping-stones.\n\"In order to return to our world...,\" the old lady begins, suddenly sounding\nsolemn, \"you two must leave behind what's most precious to you.\"\n\"Huh?!\" In spite of myself, my voice gets shrill.\n\"W-wait, Grandma\u2014don't say that after we're already here!\"\nThe old woman smiles at my protest, and her eyes squinch up. I can see the\ngaps where she's missing teeth, and it's really creepy.\n\"There's nothin' to fear. I meant the sake. Take it out,\" the old lady instructs,\nand both Yotsuha and I remove small urns from our backpacks. They're the\nkind of thing you tend to see on Shinto altars in people's houses. Made of\nglossy white ceramic, their rounded shapes are a few inches across, and they\nwiden into a pedestal at the base. The lids are sealed with braided cords, and I\ncan hear liquid splashing inside.\n\"Below the god's body,\" Grandma says, gazing at the enormous tree,\n\"there's a little shrine. Offer them there. That sake is half of you, you see.\"",

Okudera-senpai might not be here yet. Even though it's a weekend\nmorning, the area around the station is still pretty lively.\nI wipe away my sweat, straighten my jacket collar, and mutter \"Mitsuha,\nyou idiot\" three times. Then, just in case, I start looking for Okudera-senpai.\n...I'm on a date with the Okudera-senpai. Not only that, but as it happens,\nthis is my first date ever. A first date with Okudera-senpai, who's like an idol,\nor an actress, or Miss Japan? Yeah, that's setting the bar fiendishly high.\nMitsuha, you moron. It's not too late yet, so I'm begging you, switch places\nwith me!\n\"Taaaki!\"\n\"Waugh!\"\nA voice startles me from behind, and I give a really lame yell. Hastily, I\nturn around.\n\"Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?\"\n\"No, I wasn't waiting! Uh, I mean, yes, I was! Or, no...\"\nWhat's with that question?! If I tell her I waited, I might make her feel bad,\nand if I tell her I wasn't waiting, I risk making her think I was late. Aaagh,\nwhat's the right answer?\n\"Urn, I, er...\"\nFlustered, I lookup. Okudera-senpai is standing right there, smiling at me.\nMy eyes go wide. She's in black mules, a white flared miniskirt, and a\nblack off-the-shoulder blouse. The monochrome outfit leaves her shoulders and\nlegs dazzlingly exposed, and several gold accessories have been placed\nstrategically, as if placing a careful seal on the charms of her skin. There's a\nlarge mocha-colored ribbon on her small white hat.\nShe looks incredibly sophisticated and incredibly pretty.\n\"...I just got here.\"\n\"Oh, good!\" she laughs, sounding chipper.\n\"Shall we?\"\nShe takes my arm... Ah, for a moment\u2014just a moment\u2014your breast\ntouched my arm. I have a sudden, immediate urge to polish every window in\nthis town.\n\"The conversation keeps dying...\"\nIn the bathroom, I'm hanging my head real, real low. I feel like smashing it\nagainst the mirror.\nThree hours into the date, and I'm already more exhausted than I've ever\nbeen in my life. I had no idea I was this bad with girls. No, that's not it. I hope\nthat's not it. It's all Mitsuha's fault for throwing me into this situation\nunprepared. And more than anything, it's Okudera-senpai's fault for being too\npretty.\nI mean, everybody we pass stares at her with their mouths hanging open.\nThen they see me walking beside her and give me the stink-eye, like they're\nthinking, What's that little punk doing there? That's what it looks like to me,\nanyway.\nWell, sure. Even I know I'm out of my league. Look, I didn't ask her out! I\nwant to go around grabbing people's shoulders and making excuses for myself.\nConsequently, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about. Okudera-senpai can\ntell and tries starting conversations with me, but that makes me insanely\nuncomfortable, which makes it even harder to talk. It's a vicious cycle.\nDammit, Mitsuha, what do you and Okudera-senpai usually talk about?!\nHoping for a lifeline, I open my phone and check Mitsuha's memo.\n...That said, I bet you've never been on a date before.\nAnd so, below, I've put together a collection of handpicked\nlinks, just for you!\n\"Whoa, seriously?!\"\nLook at that! She's practically a god! I open the links as if clinging to them\nfor dear life.\nLink 1: How I gots me a girlfriend even tho I has a\ncommunication disorder\nLink 2: Conversation skills for the person who's never, ever\nbeen the tiniest bit popular!\nLink 3: \\bu won't make 'em sick anymore! A feature on\ntexts they'll love\n.. .Somehow I get the feeling she's selling me way, way short.\nWalking through the art museum, I'm finally feeling a little relieved.\nI'm not particularly interested in the photo exhibit, which is titled\nNostalgia, but it's great to be somewhere it isn't weird not to talk. Okudera-\nsenpai is five feet ahead of me, strolling slowly, placidly gazing at the pictures.\nFurano, Tsugaru, Sanriku, Rikuzen, Aizu, Shinshu... The exhibition is\ndivided regionally, but all the rustic scenery looks the same to me. I don't\nknow the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can\nmake out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it's\nsummer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem\noddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you\ngo. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. \"Shibuya\nand Ikebukuro,\" for example, or \"Akasaka and Kichijouji,\" or \"Meguro and\nTachikawa.\"\nEven so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.\nThis one is different from the others.\nWell, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place\u2014the contours\nof the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red\nshrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick\nout your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I\nnever actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations\nwhen I was a kid, but that's what this feels like. I'm having a surreal, powerful\nsense of deja vu about the place. This is\u2014\n\"Taki?\"\nWhen I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a\nsecond, I forgot she existed.\n\"You know, Taki,\" she says with an even smile, \"you seem like a different\nperson today.\"\nShe executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me\nbehind.\nI blew it.\nAll I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole\nthing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn't even\nconsider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.\nEven though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who'd invited her. Even though I\nshould've been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I've\nspent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.\nFrom the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi\nbuildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.\nMy eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She's not saying a word.\nHer hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,\nshe might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat\ntighten. I feel like the oxygen's suddenly thinned, and it's hard to breathe. I\ngrope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai?\"\nShe doesn't turn.\n\".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere\u2014\"\n\"Why don't we call it a day instead?\" she suggests with the tone of a patient\nteacher.\n\"Okay.\"\nOn the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-\nsenpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun\n\u2014I can't see it clearly.\n\"Taki... Forgive me if I'm wrong, all right?\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"A long time ago, you liked me a little bit, didn't you?\"\n\"Huh?!\" She knew?! How?!\n\"And now there's someone else you like, isn't there?\"\n\"Huuuuuuuh?!\" I gush sweat as if Fve suddenly teleported into a tropical\nrain forest. \"N-no, there isn't!\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Th-there isn't! There's absolutely nobody like that!\"\n\"I wonder...\"\nOkudera-senpai examines my face skeptically. Somebody else I like? No,\nthere's nobody like that. Fm pretty sure there isn't. Just for a moment, her long\nhair and the softness of her breasts flicker through my mind but vanish almost\nimmediately.\n\"Well, never mind.\"\nHer tone is bright and clear, and her face recedes.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Thank you for today. I'll see you at work.\"\nOkudera-senpai flutters a hand at me, then simply walks away, leaving me\nbehind. Mechanically, I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. Even so, no\nwords come out, and while I'm doing that, Okudera-senpai's back descends\nfrom the pedestrian bridge and disappears into the crowd in front of the station.\nI gaze at the evening sun, feeling as if I've been abandoned on the edge of\nsummer. There are no breaks in the cars streaming under the pedestrian bridge,\nand after I've been listening to them for a while, I start feeling as though I'm on\na real bridge, over a river. The late sun is as weak as a flashlight, and it's\ndisappearing behind the water tank on top of a mixed-use building. I focus on it\nthe entire time, intently, as if trying to reclaim something.\nIt feels like there are other things I should be doing, but I can't think of\nanything specific. I just want to go to Mitsuha's town again, fast. Becoming\nMitsuha means talking to her, too. When we're swapped, at the same time,\nwe're connected in some special way. We're trading experiences. We're bound\ntogether the way her grandma was talking about. If I turn into Mitsuha, I think\nI'll be able to talk about what happened today. I want to joke around with her.\n\"That's why you're not popular, you know. \" \"It's your fault for promising\nstuff without checking first. \"\nI open the memo on my phone. There's more to Mitsuha's note.\nThe comet should be visible just about the time\nthe date ends.\nEeeeee, how romantic! I can't wait for tomorrow.\nV\nWhether it's me or you, let's do our best on the\ndate!\nComet?",

I can't believe that the journal entries Mitsuha left on\nmy phone came out of my own head. That date with Okudera-senpai could\nnever have happened if I'd been myself.

I mean, look, I've got the journal entries she wrote.\"\nI retrieve my phone out of my pocket. Spurred on by the inane fear that the\nbattery will die forever if I take too long, I flip through it in a panic and pull up\nMitsuha's journal entries. They're really there.\nI rub my eyes, hard. For a moment, the letters seemed to writhe.\n\"Wha...?\"\nFirst one letter, then another.\nThe words Mitsuha wrote begin dissolving into meaningless symbols.\nBefore long, the text flickers like a candle flame, and then it's gone. One by\none, her entries disappear entirely. It's as though an invisible man is holding\ndown delete. As I watch, all her sentences vanish.\n\"Why...?\" I ask very quietly.\nThe kite's cry echoes again, high and distant.\nThree years ago in October, right around this time of year, Tiamat, a comet\nwith a solar orbital period of twelve hundred years, made its closest approach\nto Earth. It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put\nHalley's Comet's seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4\nbillion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly\nseventy-five thousand miles of Earth\u2014closer than the moon. The tail of this\nshining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first\ntime in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it\nwelcomed Comet Tiamat.\nUntil the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet's\nnucleus would split in Earth's vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in\ndiameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,\nplummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per\nsecond. Tragically, it struck Japan\u2014a residential area called Itomori.\nThe town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision\noccurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which\nmust have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.\nThe meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The\ndestruction wasn't limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge\nhole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,\nmagnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds\nlater, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater\npart of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the\ntown's population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in\nhuman history.\nSince the crater had formed right beside Itomori Lake, water rushed in,",

All I can tell is that they're\nspeaking Japanese.\nThunk! There's a loud noise, and the next thing I know, I'm slumped over\nwith my head on the desk. I must've hit my forehead; a dull pain follows a little\nlater. I'm dead tired.\nNo matter how much I read the reduced-size editions of old newspapers\nand magazine back issues, I can't seem to get the text into my head anymore.\nI've checked my phone several times, but not one of her journal entries is on it.\nEvery trace is gone.\nWith my head still down, I open my eyes. Glaring at the desk a fraction of\nan inch in front of me, I try putting into words the conclusion I've reached over\nthe past few hours.\n\"It was all just a dream, and...\"\nDo I want to believe that or not?\n\"The scenery looked familiar because I subconsciously remembered the\nnews from three years ago. Meaning, she was...\"\nWhat was she?\n\"... A ghost? Or, no...

The atmosphere\nin the room, which had seemed cold and isolated, suddenly softens. I feel\nterribly relieved.\n\"Uh, Okudera-senpai?\"\nI get up from my chair. She's crouched down in front of her backpack.\n\"I've been saying all sorts of weird stuff... I'm sorry about today.\"\nZipping her backpack as if carefully sealing something away, Okudera-\nsenpai stands. Somehow she seems to move in slow motion.\n\".. .It's fine,\" she says, shaking her head with a faint smile.\n\"I'm sorry we could only get one room.\"\n\"Tsukasa said the same thing to me downstairs,\" Okudera-senpai chuckles.\nWe're sitting facing each other across the little table by the window.\n\"I don't mind a bit. They say a group just happened to be staying here\ntonight, so they don't have any rooms to spare. The man who runs the inn said\nit's a teachers' union social.\"\nThen she laughingly tells me how they treated her to Asian pears in the\nlounge after she got out of the bath. She's the sort of person who makes\neveryone want to give her something. The scent of the inn's shampoo reaches\nme, like a rare perfume from a distant, foreign land.\n\"Look at that. Itomori used to make braided cords. How pretty,\" Okudera-\nsenpai murmurs, flipping through a volume of local Itomori materials. It's one\nof the books I borrowed from the library.\n\"My mother wears kimonos sometimes, so we have several of these at\nhome. Oh, say...\"\nLifting my teacup, my hand pauses. She's examining my right wrist.\n\"That one on your wrist, Taki. Is that a braided cord?\"\n\"Oh, this is...\"\nI set the cup down on the table and consider my arm. This is my good-luck\ncharm: a vivid orange cord, thicker than a thread, wound around my wrist.\n...Huh?\nIsn't this\u2014?\n\"I think somebody gave it to me a long time ago. I wear it sometimes, for\ngood luck...\"\nThe deepest part of my mind prickles again.\n\"Who was it?\" I murmur.\nI can't remember.\nStill, if I follow this cord, it feels like I'll find something.\n\"...You, too, Taki.\"\nThe gentle voice makes me raise my head to see concern on Okudera-\nsenpai's face. \"Why don't you go take a bath?\"\n\"Abath... Right...\"\nBut almost immediately my attention returns to the braided cord. I feel as\nthough I'll lose something forever if I let go here, and I desperately ransack my\nmemories. The dinner party is over, though I don't know when it ended. The\nquiet song of autumn insects fills the room.\n\"Somebody who made braided cords told me something once.\"\nWhose voice is that? It's kind and hoarse and tranquil. Like something from\na folktale.\n\"They said that cords are the flow of time itself. They twist and tangle,\ncome apart and reunite. They said that's time.

I've been sleeping slumped over the table by\nthe window. I can sense Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai beyond the sliding door,\nasleep on their futons. The room is strangely quiet. I can't hear any insects or\ncars. The wind isn't blowing, either.\nI sit up. The rustle of my clothes is loud enough to startle me. Outside the\nwindow, the world is just beginning to shake off the darkness.\nI look at the cord on my wrist. The faint echoes of the girl's voice linger in\nmy ears.\n\u2014Who are you? I ask. I don't even know her name.\nNaturally, there's no answer.\nBut, well, that's all right.\nOkudera-senpai and Tsukasa\u2014\nThere's a place I need to check, no matter what. Please\ngo back to Tokyo ahead of me. I'm sorry for being\nselfish. I swear I'll come back later. Thanks.\n\u2014Taki\nI write a note. As an afterthought, I take a five-thousand-yen bill out of my\nwallet and put it under a teacup along with the memo.\nWe've never met, but I'm about to come looking for you.\n+ + +\nHe's gruff and doesn't say much, but he's a really nice guy , I think, studying\nthe sinewy hands on the steering wheel beside me.\nIt's the man from the ramen shop. He's the one who took us to Itomori High\nSchool yesterday, and to the city library. I called him really early this morning,\nand he still did me a favor and brought the car over. If this hadn't worked, I\nwas planning to hitchhike, but I can't imagine any cars would've given me a\nride to a ruined, abandoned town. I'm seriously lucky I met this guy in Hida.\nFrom the passenger-side window, I have a view down to the edge of New\nItomori Lake. Half-demolished houses and broken asphalt languish in the\nwater. Even a good ways offshore, I can see telephone poles and iron beams\njutting out of the lake. It should be a very disconcerting sight, but I must have\ngotten used to seeing it on TV and in photos, because I start feeling as if the\nplace has always been like this. For that reason, I don't really know how to\nprocess what I'm seeing. Should I get mad, grieve, get scared, or lament my\nown helplessness? The reality of losing an entire town is probably too much\nfor ordinary people to get their heads around. I give up searching for meaning\nin the scene and turn my eyes to the sky. Gray clouds hang over our heads, as if\nthe gods have set an enormous lid there.\nWe travel north along the lake, and when the car can't go any higher, the\nman sets the parking brake.\n\"Looks like rain,\" he mutters, glancing up through the windshield. \"This\nmountain ain't real steep, but don't push your luck. If anythin' happens, you call\nus.\"\n\"Yessir.\"\n\"Also, here\u2014\" He holds out a big lunch box to me. \"Eat this up top.\"\nAutomatically, I accept it with both hands. It's heavy.\n\"Th-thank you very much...\"\n.. .For everything. Seriously. Why would you do so much for me? Oh yeah,\nand the ramen was super good. I can't make any of the words come out the way\nI want them to\u2014all I manage is a tiny \"Thanks. Really.\" The guy smiles\nslightly, takes out a cigarette, and lights up.\n\"I dunno what's goin' on with you,\" he says, exhaling smoke. \"But that\npicture ofltomori you made. That was good.\"\nThere's a lump in my throat. Distant thunder rumbles softly.\nI'm walking up a path to the shrine that's as vague as a deer track.\nSometimes I stop to check the destination I've marked on the map against\nthe GPS on my phone. It's all right\u2014I'm getting closer. The surrounding\nscenery looks sort of familiar, but I've climbed this mountain only once, in a\ndream. I'm not very sure about it. That means, for now, all I can do is follow\nthe map.\nAfter I got out of the car, I bowed low and stayed that way until my ride\nwas completely out of sight. As I did, I thought about Tsukasa and Okudera-\nsenpai, too. In the end, this guy and those two came all the way out here\nbecause they were worried about me. I must've looked really pathetic. I bet\nthey thought I was about to cry the whole time. I was probably so aggressively\ndistracted that, even if they wanted to ditch me, they couldn't.\nI can't keep acting like that forever. I can't keep taking advantage of the\nhelp people offer me, I think firmly, gazing at New Itomori Lake through the\ngaps in the trees.\nSuddenly, a big raindrop hits my face. The leaves around me start to rustle\nand shake. I pull up my hood and break into a run.\nThe rain keeps falling, pouring down with enough force to carve the dirt\naway.\nThe temperature's falling rapidly, absorbed by the rain. I can feel it on my\nskin.\nI eat my lunch in a little cave while waiting for the weather to let up. There\nare three big rice balls the size of my fist and lots of side dishes. The thick-\nsliced braised pork and bean sprouts stir-fried in sesame oil make it look like\nsuch a stereotypical ramen-shop lunch that it's funny. My body shakes with\ncold, but as I eat, I gradually warm up again. Chewing the grains of rice and\nswallowing, I can sense exactly where my throat and stomach are.\nThis is musubi, I think.\n\"Putting anything in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also\ncalled musubi. What you put in your body binds to your soul, you see. \"\nThat day, I decided I'd remember those words even after I woke up. I say it\naloud:\n\"...They twist and tangle, sometimes come undone, and reunite. That's\nmusubi. That's time.\"\nI look at the cord on my wrist.\nIt hasn't worn through yet. The connection is still there.\nBefore I know it, the trees have vanished, and I'm in a mossy, rocky area.\nBelow me, I can see fragments of the gourd-shaped lake through gaps in the\nthick clouds. I've finally reached the peak.\n\"...It's there!\"\nSure enough, beyond me, there's the crater-shaped basin and the giant\nsacred tree.\n\"It's really there! It wasn't a dream!\"\nThe rain has subsided to a drizzle, dripping down my cheeks like tears. I",

Is it swollen from the rain, or has enough time passed since that\ndream that the landscape changed? Either way, the great tree stands several\ndozen yards away on the other side.\nThis is the edge of the next world.\nI remember somebody saying that to me once.\nDoes that make this the Sanzu River?\nI step into the water. There's a big, echoing splash, as if I've stuck my foot\ninto a bathtub, and I realize, belatedly, that this basin is unnaturally quiet. The\nheavy water is above my knees, and every step I take makes a loud sloshing\nsound. I start feeling as if I'm tromping all over something pure and white with\nmuddy feet, defiling it. Until I arrived, this place had been perfectly silent. I'm\nnot welcome , I think instinctively. My body heat is being sucked away again,\ninto the cold water. Before long, the water's up to my chest, but I manage to get\nacross somehow.\nThe massive tree stands with its roots twined around a big slab of rock.\nI don't know whether the \"body of the god\" is the tree, the rock, or whether\nthe shape of the two of them tangled together is what people worship. There's\na little stairway in the gap between the roots and the stone, and when I go\ndown it, I find a yawning space wide enough for about four tatami mats.\nThe silence here is even deeper than it was outside.\nI unzip my jacket with freezing hands and take out my phone. I check to\nmake sure it didn't get wet, then turn it on. In the darkness, every single\nmovement sounds violently loud. With an electronic vvum that seems\ncompletely out of place here, the phone comes alive, and I use it as a flashlight.\nThis place is wholly devoid of color or warmth.\nThe tiny shrine the light reveals is completely gray. On a small stone altar,\ntwo four-inch urns sit side by side.\n\"It's the sake we carried up here.\"\nGently, I touch the surface. I don't know when it happened, but I'm not cold\nanymore.\n\"This is her little sister's...\"\nMy hand closes around the urn on the left, confirming its shape. When I pick\nit up, there's a slight resistance and a faint, dry tearing noise. The moss had put\ndown roots.\n\"And this is the one I brought.\"\nI sit down where I am, bring the urn close to my face, and shine the light on\nit. The porcelain was shiny before, but now it's thickly covered with moss. It\nmust have been a very long time. I put a thought that's been inside me all this\ntime into words.\n. .Then I was swapping with the Mitsuha from three years ago?\"\nI untie the braided cord sealing the lid. Underneath, there's a cork stopper.\n\"Were we three years out of sync? Did the swapping stop because she died\nthree years ago when the meteorite fell?\"\nI pull out the cork. The faint scent of alcohol rises. I pour the sake into the\nlid.\n\"Half of her...\"\nI bring the light closer to it. The sake is clear, with several tiny particles\nfloating in it. They reflect the light, glittering in the liquid.\n\" Musubi . Twisting and tangling, sometimes coming undone, then\nreuniting...\"\nI raise the lidful of sake to my lips.\n\"If time really can 'come undone,' then... Just one more time...\"\nTake me to her! I wish and down it in one gulp. When I swallow, the sound\nis so conspicuous it startles me. A lump of heat travels through my body. As it\nhits the bottom of my stomach, it bursts, scattering through me.\nBut nothing happens.\nFor a little while, I sit very still.\nI'm not used to alcohol, and I feel a little warm. My head feels slightly\nvague and dizzy... But that's all.\nIt's no good. It didn't work.\nI put one knee up, then stand. Abruptly, my feet tangle. My vision spins. I'm\nfalling , I think.\n...That's weird.\nI've fallen over backward, but no matter how much time passes, my back\ndoesn't hit the ground. My field of view rotates, slowly, up to the roof of the\ncave. My phone is still in my left hand. The light illuminates the ceiling.\n\"The comet...!\"\nInvoluntarily, I say it out loud.\nThere's a drawing of an enormous comet up there.\nIt's a very old picture, carved into the rock: a giant traveling star, trailing\nits long tail across the heavens. The red and blue pigments catch the light and\nshimmer. Gradually, the picture begins rising away from the ceiling of the\ncave.\nI stare.\nThe image, the illustrated comet, is falling toward me.\nSlowly, it bears down until it's nearly on top of me. It blazes with the heat\nof its friction against the atmosphere, and the lump of rock fuses into glass,\nshining like a jewel. Even those details are clear to me.\nI fall back, and my head hits the rock at the exact moment the comet strikes",

The first thing we think of is\nbroadcasting an evacuation order.\nAfter we run through the inevitable ridiculous ideas\u2014 We'll take over the\nprime minister's official residence! Or the Diet Building! Or the NHK\nShibuya Broadcasting Center, or at least the NHK Gifu-Takayama branch\noffice! \u2014we start talking about how not everybody in town will be at home\nwith their TVs or radios on and how even more people will be out and about\nbecause of the autumn festival tonight. Then we fall silent, thinking.\n\".. .The disaster alert system!\" Teshigawara shouts suddenly.\n\"Disaster alert system?\"\n\"Hunh? Don't go tellin' me you don't know. There are speakers all over\ntown, remember?\"\n\"Oh... That thing that starts talking out of the blue every morning and\nevening? Who was born, who's having a funeral, that sort of thing?\"\n\"Yeah. You can hear that all over town for sure, whether you're inside or\nout. If we send the order over that...!\"\n\"Huh? But, uh...how? That comes from the town hall, doesn't it? Would\nthey let us broadcast stuff if we asked?\"\n\"Pssh. No.\"\n\"Then what do we do? Hijack Town Hall? I mean, I guess we'd have a\nbetter shot at that than at taking over NHK, but...\"\n\"Heh-heh-heh.\" With a creepy smile, Teshigawara types something into his\nphone. Geez, this guy looks happy.\n\"We can do this!\"\nHe holds out his phone to me.\nSuperimposed frequencies, it reads, and below is an explanation.\n\"Wha...? Is this for real?\"\nTeshigawara flares his nostrils and nods proudly.\n\"Uh, Tesshi... Why do you even know stuff like this?\"\n\"Well, I always fantasize before I fall asleep, y'know? About destroyin' the\ntown, overthrowin' the school, stuff like that. Doesn't everybody?\"\n\"Huh...?\" That weirds me out a bit. But, no\u2014this is...\n\"This is awesome, Tesshi! It just might work!\"\nWithout thinking, I throw an arm around Teshigawara's shoulders.\n\"H-hey, don't get too close!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWhoa. Even his ears are red.\n\"What's this? Tesshi, are you embarrassed?\"\nI look up into Teshigawara's face from below, grinning at him. Well, well,\nMitsuha, you're not to be taken lightly, are you? C'mon, c'mon! I press my\nbody against him some more. Here you go\u2014have a freebie! We're sitting side\nby side on an old sofa, and Tesshi's already right by the wall, so he's got\nnowhere to run.\n\"Hey, Mitsuha, cut it out!\"\nTeshigawara resists, big body squirming. He's a guy, for sure... Well, so\nam I. Then, abruptly, Teshigawara jumps up, climbing onto the back of the sofa,\nand yells, \"I told you, knock it off! A single girl your age\u2014that ain't proper!\"\n\"Ha...\"\nEven his buzzed scalp is red. He's sweating bullets, and his eyes look\nalmost teary.\n\"Ha, ha-ha-ha! Tesshi, you're such a...!\"\nIn spite of myself, I crack up laughing.\nHe's a really good guy, and I'm positive I can count on him.\nI thought of him as a friend before, but I'd like to meet him and the others\nfor real and talk to them as a guy soon. Me and Mitsuha and Teshigawara and\nSaya. If Tsukasa and Takagi and Okudera-senpai were there, too, I know it'd\nbe a blast.\n\"Sorry, Tesshi. I was just so happy you believed me...\" I'm biting back\nlaughter, and Teshigawara's sulking. \"Will you help me think up the rest of the\nevacuation plan?\"\nI smile at him Tesshi's face is still red, but even so, he nods seriously.\nOnce this is over, I'll come see this guy, too, I think, feeling a little bit\ndazzled.\n\"A-a-a...a bomb?!\"\nSaya yells. She's eating a mini shortcake from a clear plastic wrapper.\n\"Technically, they're called water-gel explosives. They're kinda like\ndynamite,\" Teshigawara tells her, sounding proud. He's crunching away on\npotato chips, and I'm noshing on chocolate drops. Saya bought a ton of\nconvenience-store food and spread it all over the desk, so it sort of feels like\nwe're having a party.\nTeshigawara and I are standing behind a map, outlining our carefully\nengineered evacuation plan to Saya. I almost want to play some energetic\nmusic to set the stage. Something percussive and a bit unhinged\u2014something\nthat sounds like a strategy meeting.\nTaking a gulp of coffee milk from a pint-size pack, Teshigawara continues.\n\"There's lots of explosives in my dad's company's warehouse, for construction\nstuff. If I don't have to worry about gettin' caught afterward, I can snatch as\nmuch as we need.\"\n\"Then, next,\" I say, opening a melon bread wrapper. I'm really hungry, and\nfor some reason, everything I eat when I'm in Mitsuha's body tastes really\ngood.\n\"Y-y-y.. .you're gonna hijack the signal?!\" Saya's voice cracks.\nMunching on curry bread, Teshigawara explains. \"Rural wireless disaster\nalert systems like ours are easy to take over, as long as you know the\ntransmission frequency and the superimposed wake-up frequency. The\nspeakers are made so they'll activate as long as a specific frequency is layered\nover the audio.\"\nMelon bread in one hand, I pick up where he left off. \"That means we can\nsend the evacuation order all over town from the school broadcasting room.\"\nI point at the map of Itomori. There's a circle with a diameter of a little less\nthan a mile, centered on Miyamizu Shrine, and I trace its edge with my finger.\n\"This is the area that's supposed to take damage from the meteorite. As you\ncan see, Itomori High is outside it.\" I tap on the location of the high school.\n\"In other words, we just need to evacuate people here, to the schoolyard.\"\n\"B-but that's...\" Saya begins stammering nervously. \"That's a full-blown\ncrime!\"\nEven as she says it, she's putting the strawberry\u2014which she saved for last\n\u2014in her mouth.\n\"We'll never get the people around here to move without committing a\ncrime,\" I tell her coolly, sweeping away the chocolate drops I'd scattered over\nthe map. That's right. As long as it gets the people inside this circle to leave, it\ndoesn't matter whether it's a crime or not.\n\"Y'know, Mitsuha, it's like you're a different person.\"\nI grin and take a big bite of melon bread. When I'm in this body, I\nunconsciously start talking a bit like a girl, but I've completely abandoned\ntrying to act like Mitsuha. As long as these guys are still safe when\neverything's over, nothing else matters. As long as we're all alive, things will\nwork out.\n\"...So. You're the one in charge of the broadcast, Saya,\" I tell her\ncheerfully.\n\"Why?!\"\n\"Well, you're in the broadcasting club, right?\"\n\"Plus, your big sis is in charge of the Town Hall broadcast. Get her to tell\nyou the wireless frequency,\" says Teshigawara.\n\"Huh? I can't just...\"\nIgnoring Saya's protest, Teshigawara happily points to himself. \"I'm the\nexplosives guy!\"\n\"And I'm going to go talk to the mayor,\" I say, pointing to myself.\n\"Huh?!\" Saya is speechless, and Teshigawara picks up the explanation.\n\"We can probably set up the evacuation on our own with the plan we just\ntalked about. But if the town hall and firefighters don't come out at the end,\nthere's no way we'll get everybody in all one hundred eighty-eight families to\nmove, y'know?\"",

I try stabbing it in like a needle,\nto carve a name that won't disappear. The pen won't budge a traction of an\ninch.

Even if we're separated, even if we never meet\nagain, I'll fight. As if I'd ever resign myself to this! The powerful, fleeting\nresolution feels as though I'm picking a fight with the gods. Very soon, I'll\nforget even the fact that I've forgotten something.\nAnd so, making that single emotion my foothold, I demand of the night sky\none last time:\n\"What's your name?\"\nThe cry becomes an echo, rebounding off the dark mountains. Asking its\nquestion of the void over and over, it diminishes, bit by bit.\nFinally, silence descends.\nChapter Seven",

Its long tail streams over the\nclouds. It's scattering shining scales like a giant moth. I'm not letting you get\nyour way , I think, as if challenging it to a fight.\nIt's all right.

As impressions went, it was dumb. Still, it struck me as so awesome\nthat it made me shiver and, at the same time, so frightening it set my heart\ntrembling as well.\n\"Look!\"\nSuddenly, the announcer who'd been delivering commentary yelled in\nexcitement.\n\"The comet appears to have split in two. Around it are...what seem to be\ncountless shooting stars.\"\nWhen the camera zoomed in, the comet really had forked above the\nbackground of Tokyo skyscrapers. Thin lines like a meteor shower appeared\nand disappeared at its tip. There was a delicate, almost artificial beauty about\nit, and my eyes went wide.\n+ +\nAbruptly, the wireless broadcast is interrupted by the click of an opening door.\nI hear a short shriek from Saya, and then several familiar male voices\nemerge from the speakers.\n\"Kid, what are you doin'?!\"\n\"Hurry, shut it off!\"\nThere's a clatter like a chair falling over, and then the wireless broadcast\ncuts off with a brief burst of shrill feedback.\n\"Saya...!\" I stop, calling her name involuntarily.\nThe teachers caught her. Large beads of sweat pop out as if they've just\nremembered their jobs, falling to the asphalt with audible drips. I'm on the\nroad that circles around the lake, the one that goes to the town hall and the high\nschool, and I start hearing bewildered voices from several evacuees.\n\"What? What's goin' on?\"\n\"Huh? Was there some sort of trouble?\"\n\"What about the evacuation?\"\nOh no. A moment later, a voice booms from the wireless speakers again.\n\"This is Itomori Town Hall.\"\nIt's not Saya or her big sister. It's the middle-aged guy in charge of Town\nHall broadcasts, someone I hear every once in a while.\n\"We are currently looking into the circumstances surrounding the\naccident. We request that all residents refrain from panicking. Please stay\nwhere you are and wait for further instructions.\"\nI lurch forward again.\nThey figured out where the broadcast was coming from, and the town hall\ncontacted the school. Saya's going to get grilled by the teachers. Tesshi will be\nin big trouble, too, if this keeps up.\n\"I repeat: Do not panic.

I even worked\nat a few part-time\u2014\"\n\"I see.\" One of the interviewers cuts me off gently. \"Then could you tell us\nwhy you chose to enter the construction field, rather than the restaurant\nindustry?\"\nShe's a middle-aged woman, the only one of the four who looked kind, and\nI finally realize I've been blabbing about an irrelevant reason for applying. I\nbreak out in a sweat in a suit I'm not yet used to wearing.\n\"Well, I... Serving customers at my part-time job was fun, but I guess you\ncould say I wanted to be involved in something bigger...\"\nSomething bigger? That's a middle school answer. Even I can tell my face\nis flushing red.\n\"I mean... The way I see it, there's no telling when even Tokyo could\ndisappear.\"\nThis time, the interviewers' faces really do cloud over. Realizing I've been\ntouching the back of my neck, I hastily put hands on my knees again.\n\"So if it does\u2014 No, precisely because it will someday, I want to create the\nsort of town that warms people, even if it's only a memory\u2014\"\nAgh, it's no good. Even I can't follow what I'm saying. I've failed this one,\ntoo. Thinking this, I glance at the gray skyscrapers that tower behind the\ninterviewers, and I feel like crying.\n\"So? How many companies have you interviewed at, including today?\"\nTakagi asks me.\n\"I'm not keeping track,\" I tell him glumly.\nLooking awfully entertained, Tsukasa says, \"I don't think you're going to\nmake it.\"\n\"I don't want to hear that from you,\" I cut back crossly\n\"Sure it's not because you just don't look good in a suit?\" Takagi grins.\n\"You guys aren't much different!\" I bristle angrily.\n\"I've got unofficial offers from two companies,\" he counters cheerfully.\n\"I have eight,\" Tsukasa condescends.\n\"Rrgh...!\"\nI have no comeback. My coffee cup rattles in my fingers as they tremble\nwith humiliation.",

      "text": "Tweedle.\nMy phone chirps from the table. I check the message, drain what's left of\nmy coffee in one gulp, and stand.\nCome to think of it, the three of us came to this cafe a lot when we were in\nhigh school. The memory strikes me after I've waved good-bye to Tsukasa and\nTakagi and started jogging toward the station. Life was so carefree back then. I\ndidn't have to think about the future or finding a job, and somehow, every day\nwas ludicrously fun. Especially that one summer\u2014I think it was during my\nsecond year of high school. It seems like that summer was especially thrilling.\nWhat happened that year? I think back and conclude there wasn't anything in\nparticular. I guess I must've just been at an age when absolutely anything was\nenough to trigger a giggling fit.\n...Wait, no, that's something they say about girls... Absentmindedly, I hop\ndown the stairs to the subway.\n\"Ooh. Job hunting, hmm?\"\nOkudera-senpai looks up from her phone, sees me in my suit, and smiles.\nIt's evening, and the area in front of Yotsuya Station is filled with the faintly\nlanguid hum of people released from their days at work or school.\n\"Ha-ha. Well, it's not going so great.\"\n\"Hmm...\" Okudera-senpai murmurs, bringing her face closer to mine. She\ninspects me from head to toe with a frown. Then, gravely, she asks, \"You don't\nthink it's because suits don't look good on you?\"\n\"I-is it really that bad?!\" Involuntarily, I look down at myself.\n\"Oh, come on, I'mjoking!\"\nOkudera-senpai beams, her expression changing easily.\n\"Let's walk a little,\" Okudera-senpai says, and I follow her. We set off,\ngoing against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut\nacross Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that\nthe trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass\nhave on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,\ntoo.\n\"What's going on today? Your text came out of the blue.\"\nFeeling as if I'm the only one who hasn't kept up with the season, I turn to\nOkudera-senpai beside me.\n\"What?\" Her glossy lips pout. \"I can't get in touch with you without a\nreason?\"\n\"No, no, no!\" I wave my hands hastily.\n\"You're happy to see me, aren't you? It's been a long time.\"\n\"Y-yes. I am.\"\nShe smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. \"I was in the area\nfor work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki.\" She was hired by a major\nclothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. \"Life in the suburbs\nis fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind,\" she tells me, gazing at\nher surroundings like she's a little awestruck. \"Look,\" she says suddenly, and I\nraise my head.\nWe're crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we're eye level with the giant\noutdoor display screen above an electronics store. It's showing aerial footage\nof gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster\u2014Eight\nYears Later in big letters.\n\"We went to Itomori once, didn't we?\" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,\nas though she's searching distant memories. \"You were still in high school,\nTaki, so it must've been...\"\n\"Five years ago, maybe?\" I finish the sentence for her.\n\"That long...\" She exhales a little, as if surprised. \"I'm forgetting all sorts\nof things.\"\nShe's right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk\nup Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I\ntry remembering that day.\nIt was the summer of my second year in high school\u2014 No, it was just about\nthis time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short\ntrip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way\nto Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.\nRight, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the\nside of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur\nand grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a\nvague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed\na mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to\nTokyo by myself the next day.\nThat's right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that\ncomet.\nIn the sort of natural disaster that's happened only a few times in human\nhistory, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,\nalmost all the town's residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the\ncomet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and\nmost of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.\nIt was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all\nsorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical\nphenomenon and the townspeople's stupendous luck were enough to stir up the\nmedia's and public's imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around\nwildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet's visit\nwith Itomori's dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or\nquestioned the mayor of Itomori's use of plenary power in forcing an\nevacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been\nforetold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so\nisolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the\npower across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite\nstrike, spurred public speculation. Society's excitement lasted until the\nprograms to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as\nwith most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of\nItomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.\nStill... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I'd even drawn sketches of\nItomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had\nmaterialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had\nvisited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.\nWhat in the world had it been?\nWell, I guess it's not important , I think, watching the streets of Yotsuya sink\ninto the dusk from a hill beside Sotobori Street. It really doesn't matter now. I\nwrite the thought on a wall in my mind. I need to be focusing on finding a job\nnext year, not ancient history I don't really remember.\n\"The wind's come up,\" Okudera-senpai whispers, and her long, wavy hair\nrises softly. A sweet scent I smelled once, somewhere long ago and far away,\nreaches my nose faintly. Like a conditioned reflex, the fragrance sparks a\nmelancholy inside me.\n\"Thanks for spending the day with me. This is far enough,\" Okudera-senpai\nsays when I offer to see her to the turnstile at the station.\nWe ate dinner at the Italian restaurant where we'd worked part-time as\nstudents. Thanks to a promise I totally don't remember making\u2014\"Come to\nthink of it, Taki, didn't you say you'd treat me after you graduated from high\nschool?\"\u2014I ended up paying for Okudera-senpai. Even so, I felt a little bit\nproud picking up the check.",

I'll see you later.\" She waves at me, and there's a band like a thin drop\nof water shining on her ring finger.\n\"You'll find happiness someday, too,\" she'd assured me earlier over an\nespresso, after informing me she was getting married. I couldn't manage a good\nresponse\u2014I just mumbled something congratulatory.\nI'm not particularly unhappy , I think, watching Okudera-senpai's\nsilhouette descend the pedestrian-bridge stairs. That said, I don't really\nunderstand what happiness is yet, either.\nI abruptly inspect my palm. All that's there is an absence.\nJust a little longer..., I think one more time.\nBefore I know it, the season's changed again.\nAn unusually typhoon-filled autumn passed, moving straight into a winter of\nnothing but cold rain. Tonight, too, the rain is whispering down unabated, like\nthe memory of a pleasant chat on some bygone day Christmas lights twinkle\nbeyond windows beaded thickly with water droplets.\nI take a sip from my paper cup of coffee, as if swallowing my scattered\nthoughts, then look down at my notebook again. Even now, in December, it's\npacked with job-hunting appointments.\nVisits with former upperclassmen to discuss their work, information\nsessions, entry deadlines, paper schedules, interview dates. The range is\nchaotic, covering everything from major general contractors to design offices\nto old-town factories, and as I check the notebook against the schedule on my\nphone, even I'm a bit disgusted by it. I start organizing the main points from\ntomorrow onward, writing them into my notebook.\n\"Y'know, I'd like to go to at least one more bridal fair.\"\nMixed with the sound of the rain, the conversations of strangers sound a bit\nlike secrets. The couple behind me has been discussing their wedding for a\nwhile now, and it makes me think of Okudera-senpai. Their voices and bearing\nare completely different, though. There's a bit of an easygoing regional accent\nto their speech, and their conversation seems completely relaxed, as if they're\nchildhood friends. I'm not really listening, but my ears pick up what they're\nsaying.\n\"Again?\" The guy sounds annoyed, but even then, there's no mistaking the\naffection in his tone. \"We've been to a ton of fairs already. They were all\npretty much the same stuff.\"\n\"Well, I was thinkin' a Shinto ceremony might be nice, too.\"\n\"You said your dream was to have it in a chapel.\"\n\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I can't make up my mind that easily.\"\n\"But you said you did make up your mind,\" the guy quietly complains, and I\nchuckle.\nThe girl ignores him. \"Hmm.she murmurs, thinking. \"Never mind that.\nTesshi, you gotta shave off those whiskers before the ceremony.\"\nI was about to drink my coffee, but my hand stops dead.\nMy pulse is speeding up, though I don't understand why.\n\"I'll lose a few pounds for you, 'kay?\"\n\"But you're eatin' cake!\"\n\"I'll start for real tomorrow!\"\nSlowly, I look behind me.\nThe two of them have already gotten up from their chairs and are pulling on\ntheir coats. The tall, skinny guy is wearing a stocking cap over his buzzed\nhead. I just catch a glimpse of his profile. The girl is petite, and her bobbed\nhair makes her seem young, almost like a student. The pair turns away and\nleaves the cafe. For some reason, I can't take my eyes off their backs.\n\"Thank you for your visit.\" The cafe employee's voice reaches my ears\nindistinctly, mingled with the rain.\nBy the time I leave the cafe, the rain has turned to snow.\nMaybe it's because of all the moisture up in the atmosphere, but the town is\noddly warm in the falling snow. I feel strangely uneasy, as if I've wandered\ninto the wrong season. It seems to me as if each and every person I pass is\nhiding some important secret, and in spite of myself, I keep turning back to\nlook at them.\nI go straight to the ward library, which is almost ready to close for the\nevening. The sparseness of the handful of readers in the vast, vaulted space\nmakes the air inside feel even chillier than outside. I take a seat and open the\nbook I've retrieved from the stacks. The title is Vanished Itomori\u2014Complete\nRecords. It's a collection of photographs.\nAs if removing an ancient seal, I slowly page through the book.\nGingko trees and an elementary school. The shrine's steep stairs, with their\nview over the lake. A shrine gate with peeling paint. A tiny railroad crossing,\nlike toy building blocks abruptly set down in the fields. A pointlessly\nexpansive parking lot, two snack bars right next to each other, a drab concrete\nhigh school. A prefectural road with old, cracked asphalt. A guardrail that\ntraces a winding hill road. Vinyl greenhouses, reflecting the sky.\nThey're the sort of ordinary sights you see all over Japan, so I recognize all\nof them.

I wonder as I turn the pages.\nWhy do the unremarkable sights of a town that no longer exists make my\nheart hurt this much?\n+ + +\nOnce, fueled by intense emotions, I made some sort of resolution.\nI remember this out of nowhere when I look up at the light in somebody's\nwindow on my way home, or when I reach for a box lunch in the convenience\nstore, or when I retie my loose shoelaces.\nI decided something once. I took an oath because I met somebody\u2014no, so\nthat I would meet somebody.\nWashing my face and staring into the mirror, tossing a plastic bag in the\ntrash, squinting at the morning sun between the buildings, I think this and smile\nwryly.\n\"Somebody,\" \"something.\" In the end, I don't know a thing.\nStill, I think as I close the door at an interview.\nStill, even now, I'm fighting my way through. Perhaps it's a bit dramatic to\nsay, but I'm struggling against life. Wasn't that what I decided once? To\nstruggle. To live. To breathe and walk. To run. To eat. To bind, musubi. To live\nan ordinary life so I shed tears over the sights of a perfectly ordinary town.\nJust a little longer , I think.\nJust a little is fine. Just a little more.\nI don't know what it is I want, but I keep on wishing for something.\nJust a little longer. Just a little more.\nThe cherry blossoms bloom and scatter, long rains wash the streets, white\nclouds billow high, the leaves change color, freezing winds blow. Then the\ncherry trees bloom again.\nThe days are accelerating.\nI've graduated from university, and I'm working at the job I somehow\nmanaged to find. I spend every day with the desperation of a man trying not to\nbe flung from a careening vehicle. There are times when I can believe I'm\ngetting closer, in very tiny increments, to the place I want to be.\nIn the morning, when I wake up, I stare at my right hand. There are little\ndrops of water on my index finger. By the time I notice them, both the dream I\nwas in a moment earlier and the tears that for an instant stained my eyes have\nevaporated.\nJust a little longer. With that thought, I get out of bed.\nJust a little longer.\nAs I recite the wish, I face the mirror and tie my hair cord. I pull my arms\nthrough the sleeves of my spring suit. I open the door of my apartment and, for\na moment, gaze at the Tokyo cityscape that unfurls before me. I climb the\nstation stairs, go through the automated turnstile, and board a packed commuter\ntrain. The little patch of blue sky I can see beyond the heads of the crowd is\npiercingly clear.\nI lean against the train door, looking out. The city teems with people, in the\nwindows of buildings, in cars, on pedestrian bridges. A hundred people to a\ncar, a thousand people to a train, a thousand trains crisscrossing the city.\nGazing at them, I make my wish. Just a little longer.\nIn that instant, with absolutely no warning, I see her.\nAnd then, I see him.\nHe's there, close enough to touch if it weren't for the windowpanes, on a\ntrain running parallel to this one. He's looking straight at me, and his eyes are\nwide with surprise, like mine. Then I realize what the wish I've carried for so\nlong really is.\nShe's there, just a few feet away. I don't even know her name, but I know\nit's her. Our trains are pulling away from each other. Then another train passes\nbetween us, and I lose sight of her.\nBut I finally know what I'm wishing for.\nI wanted to stay with her, just a little longer.\nI want to be with him, just a little more.\nThe train stops, and I dash through the streets. I'm looking for her. I'm already\npositive she's looking for me, too.\nWe've met before. Or, no, that could be my imagination. It might be just an\nassumption, something like a dream. It might be a delusion, like past lives.\nEven so, I\u2014we\u2014wanted to stay together a little longer. We want to be\ntogether, just a little more.\nAs I run along the sloping road, I wonder, Why am I running? Why am 1\nsearching? I probably know the answer. I don't remember it, but everything in",

A wind that smells\nlike flowers lifts my suit jacket and fills it out into a bell. She's standing at the\ntop of the stairs, but I can't look at her directly. I only watch her out of the\ncorner of my eye. She's descending the stairs. The click of her shoes drifts\nsoftly into the spring air. My heart is leaping in my rib cage.\nAs we approach each other, we keep our eyes downcast. He doesn't say\nanything. I can't say anything, either. Then, still without speaking, we pass each\nother.

It goes against something as basic as the\nmechanics of the universe, or the laws of life. And so...\nAnd so I turn around. She turns, too, with the exact same speed.

My\nwhole body trembles slightly.\nI finally found him. We finally met. Just as I think I'll probably burst into\ntears unless I do something, I realize I'm already crying. Seeing this, he smiles.\nEven as I cry, I smile, too.

      "text": "Afterword\nTo be honest, I didn't intend to write this novel.\nIt may be rude to the readers for me to say something like that, but I thought\nyour name, worked best as an animated film\nThis book, your name., is the novel version of an animated movie I\ndirected, which is scheduled to open in the summer of 2016. In other words,\nit's a novelization of the movie, but actually, as I'm writing this afterword, the\nmovie hasn't been finished yet. They tell me it will take another three months\nor so to complete. That means the novel will go out into the world first, so if\nyou asked me which is the original work, the movie or the novel, I'd have to\nsay, \"It's complicated.\" Writing this book has altered some of my personal\nimpressions as well. For example, Mitsuha was a pretty laid-back, optimistic\nkid, wasn't she? and Taki really is hopeless with women. It's likely to\ninfluence the postrecording (when the actors and voice actors create the voices\nfor us) for the movie. This \"gift exchange\" between a movie and a novel was a\nfirst for me, and to tell the truth, it was a lot of fun.\nThere are no major differences between the novel and the movie as far as\nthe story is concerned, but there are slight differences in the way it's told. The\nnovel is written from Taki's and Mitsuha's first-person perspectives; in other\nwords, from their viewpoints only. They can't tell us about things they don't\nknow. Meanwhile, movies generally use third-person perspectives: the world\nas the camera shows it to us. For that reason, many scenes are literally told\nfrom a high-angle viewpoint and include characters other than Taki and\nMitsuha. I think it's more than possible to enjoy either work on its own, but due\nto the unique characteristics of each medium, they inevitably complement each\nother.\nI wrote the novel on my own, but movies are made by the hands of many\npeople. The script for your name, took shape over several months of\npreliminary meetings with the Toei (the movie company) your name. team.\nProducer Genki Kawamura's suggestions were always brisk and decisive, and\nalthough I sometimes secretly thought, He's really superficial (because he's the\nsort of person who says even important things like they don't mean much), he\nalways showed me the way.\nIn addition, I wrote this book both at home and in the movie production\nstudio, about half in each location, and I think it's thanks to the animation\ndirector, Masashi Ando, that I managed to complete it. It wasn't that I\ndiscussed the novel with him It's just that, thanks to his truly dedicated work\non the movie itself, I was able to relax even in the pandemonium of an\nanimated film production site and make time to work on the book.\nThen there's the score by RADWIMPS, the group in charge of the movie's\nmusic. Naturally, there's no background music in the novel, but the book was\ngreatly influenced by the world of RADWIMPS's lyrics. The role music plays\nin the your name, movie is a big one, and I hope you'll pay particular attention\nto how it was rendered in both the movie and the novel. (In order to do that, I\nguess you'll need to see the movie. Please do go see it!)\nI wrote in the beginning that I thought this story worked best as an animated\nfilm, but that's because the movie is\u2014as I mentioned before\u2014a splendid\ncrystallization of the talents of many people. I think movies are in a place that's\nfar beyond the ability of individuals.\nEven so, in the end, I did write a novel version.\nAt some point, I changed my mind, and I began wanting to write it.\nI had the feeling that, somewhere, there were boys and girls like Taki and\nMitsuha. This story is a fantasy, of course, but I do think there are people\nsomewhere who've had experiences similar to theirs, and who hold similar\nfeelings inside. People who've lost precious loved ones or places, and who've\nprivately decided to \"struggle and fight,\" even so. People who believe that\nthey're sure to find something someday, even though it hasn't happened yet, and\nwho keep reaching out for it. I felt that those feelings needed to be related with\nan immediacy that differed from the glamour of the movie, and I think that's\nwhy I wrote this book.\nThank you very much for picking it up, and for reading it.\nMarch 2016, Makoto Shinkai",

      "text": "Essay\nGenki Kawamura\n\"Please write the essay.\"\nThat's what Makoto Shinkai said to me in a meeting room at CoMix Wave\nFilms.\nThe sudden request flustered me, and I told him I thought interpretive\nessays should be written objectively, by third parties.\nI'm the producer of the your name, movie, and I don't have that perspective\nanymore.\nEven so, Shinkai wouldn't back down. He pressed me. Please. I want you\nto do this, no matter what.\nSeveral months later, I read the novel. It was a wonderful book.\nAt that point, I thought I understood why Shinkai had asked me for the\nessay.\nHe didn't want me to \"interpret\" anything, I realized. He wanted somebody\nwho was \"in the family\" to reveal how this novel came to be.\nTwo years ago, I decided to make a feature film with Makoto Shinkai.\nThat night, I was drinking sake with him at a cheap pub under the elevated\ntracks in Yurakucho.\nWe were talking, me with a highball, him with a draft beer.\nVoices of a Distant Star. The Place Promised in Our Early Days. 5\nCentimeters Per Second.\nShinkai writes love stories about boys and girls who pass each other by in\nbeautiful, magnificent worlds. I told him I wanted him to make his newest work\n\"Makoto Shinkai's best film.\"\nI wanted people who didn't yet know Shinkai to encounter his world and be\nastonished (the way I was floored when I saw Voices of a Distant Star\nfourteen years ago). I also wanted people who had kept up with Shinkai's\nworks to witness, as if for the first time, what this particular talent could\naccomplish.\nIn addition, I told him I wanted the new work to be endlessly musical.\n(Makoto Shinkai's works always have splendid music.) I asked him if there\nwere any musicians he liked, and he named a certain band. I'd been on friendly\nterms with that band's front man for a while, and under the i nfl uence of drink, I\nsent him a text.\n\"I started looking for you in your third life back.\"\nHalf a year later, Yojiro Noda of RAD WIMPS sent over a demo of \"Third\nLife Back,\" the theme song. It was a fantastic track that will probably turn out\nto be epoch-making for RAD WIMPS as well.\n\"I'm so psyched that I'm out in a downpour getting soaked as I listen to it.\"\nFor some reason, that Line message from Shinkai almost made me cry.\nIn this world, which is overflowing with encounters, it's hard to find your\nsoul mate. Even if you do find them, who's going to prove to you that they\nreally are your soul mate?\nMakoto Shinkai and Yojiro Noda wrote the story of a pair who keep\nmissing each other in an endlessly big world.\nThese two met as if guided by fate, and the result was a miraculous\ncollaboration (even if it was triggered by a pub under the train tracks).\nMakoto Shinkai wrote the story and script, Yojiro Noda picked them up and\nexpanded them as music, and together, they became this book. In addition,\nalthough the movie is nearly finished, because this book was written, it's\nfilling out even more. Seriously, how was this production so lucky?\n\"I'm not going to write a novel this time.\"\nThat's what Shinkai said, but Yojiro Noda's music made him write it.\nIt's not possible to play audio in novels, but I can hear RAD WIMPS's\nsongs from this one.\nI think it's a rare book, the product of a fateful encounter.\nIn 2012,1 wrote a novel called If Cats Disappeared from the World.\nIt was a portrait of a dying postman.\nI thought I was writing about death, but at some point, it turned into a story\nabout memories.\nWhat is the crudest thing, as far as people are concerned? Death, naturally.\nThat's what I always thought.\nHowever, there's something that's cruder than death.\nIt's forgetting the person you love while you're alive.\nWhere do human memories live?\nAre they in the synaptic circuitry of the brain? Do retinas and fingertips\nhold memories, too? Or is there an invisible, amorphous, mistlike, spiritual\ncollective somewhere, and that's where the memories reside? Something we'd\ncall the heart or the mind or the soul. Is it something you can take out and stick\nback in, like a memory card with an OS on it?\nIn the book, Taki wonders to himself about this.\nHumans are mysterious creatures. We forget the important things, and all\nwe remember are the things that don't matter. Unlike memory cards, we don't\nhave the ability to keep the important stuff and delete what we don't need. I\nalways wondered why that was.\nHowever, now that I've read this book, I feel as if I understand, just a little.\nPeople forget the important things.\nThat said, by resisting, by struggling against that, they gain life.\nyour name., a movie that tells the love story of a boy and girl \"struggling,\nmagnificently\" in this cruel world, will be completed very shortly. Without a\ndoubt, it's going to be \"Makoto Shinkai's best film\"\u2014 No, let me rephrase that.\nThe world is about to meet \"Makoto Shinkai's ultimate masterpiece.\"\nNow, with the same feelings as the people who've read this novel, I'm\nlooking forward to my encounter with that movie from the bottom of my heart.\n(Film producer and novelist)",
