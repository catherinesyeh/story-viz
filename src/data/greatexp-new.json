I was nearly going away without the\npie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that\nwas put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,\nand I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not\nintended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.\nThere was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I\nunlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe's tools.\nThen I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which\nI had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the\nmisty marshes.",

A handsome mince-pie had\nbeen made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not\nbeing missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive\narrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of\nbreakfast; \"for I ain't,\" said Mrs. Joe,\u2014\"I ain't a-going to have no\nformal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got\nbefore me, I promise you!\"\nSo, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on\na forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of\nmilk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the\ndresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and\ntacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the\nold one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,\nwhich was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the\nyear in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four\nlittle white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black\nnose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of\nthe other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite\nart of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than\ndirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the\nsame by their religion.",

In his working-clothes, Joe was a\nwell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he\nwas more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.\nNothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and\neverything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive\noccasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,\nthe picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,\nI think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young\noffender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and\ndelivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged\nmajesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being\nborn in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,\nand against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I\nwas taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make\nthem like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the\nfree use of my limbs.\nJoe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle\nfor compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to\nwhat I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.\nJoe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be\nequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\ndone. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the\nChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\nterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived\nthe idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman\nsaid, \"Ye are now to declare it!\" would be the time for me to rise and\npropose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure\nthat I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to\nthis extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.",

This _is_ kind!\" Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as he\nnow retorted, \"It's no more than your merits. And now are you all\nbobbish, and how's Sixpennorth of halfpence?\" meaning me.\nWe dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts\nand oranges and apples to the parlour; which was a change very like\nJoe's change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister\nwas uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally\nmore gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I\nremember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,\nwho held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married\nMr. Hubble,\u2014I don't know at what remote period,\u2014when she was much\nyounger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,\nstooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs\nextraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some\nmiles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.\nAmong this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't\nrobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and\nthe Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to\nspeak (I didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the\nscaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure\ncorners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason\nto be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have\nleft me alone. But they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think\nthe opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,\nevery now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an\nunfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched\nup by these moral goads.\nIt began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\ntheatrical declamation,\u2014as it now appears to me, something like a\nreligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,\u2014and\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\nUpon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\nreproachful voice, \"Do you hear that? Be grateful.\"\n\"Especially,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"be grateful, boy, to them which\nbrought you up by hand.\"\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\npresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, \"Why is it that the\nyoung are never grateful?\" This moral mystery seemed too much for the\ncompany until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, \"Naterally\nwicious.\" Everybody then murmured \"True!\" and looked at me in a\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.",

Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with\nunspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning\nround several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and\nrushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,\nviolently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces,\nand apparently out of his mind.\nI held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn't know how I\nhad done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my\ndreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and\nsurveying the company all round as if _they_ had disagreed with him,\nsank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, \"Tar!\"\nI had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug.

And now, when they were all in lively\nanticipation of \"the two villains\" being taken, and when the bellows\nseemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke\nto hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and\nall the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the\nblaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale\nafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have\nturned pale on their account, poor wretches.\nAt last, Joe's job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As\nJoe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us\nshould go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr.\nPumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies'\nsociety; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was\nagreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should\nhave got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe's curiosity to know\nall about it and how it ended.

A\nfew faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came\nout. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.\nThere we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant's\nhand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the\ngraves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding\nanything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate\nat the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us\nhere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\nNow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\nthought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\nhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\ncome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\nhad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\nimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\nhunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\ntreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\nIt was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe's\nback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a\nhunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and\nto keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a\npretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking\nthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.\nEither the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.\nUnder the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the\nmound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,\nthough all of a watery lead colour.\nWith my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe's broad shoulder, I\nlooked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I\ncould hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by\nhis blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\nstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\nsheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;\nand the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\nthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.",

I had alighted from Joe's back on the brink of the\nditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly\nwhen he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I\nhad been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my\ninnocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended\nmy intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it\nall passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a\nday, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having\nbeen more attentive.\nThe soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four\ntorches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been\nalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards\nvery dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in\na ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches\nkindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the\nopposite bank of the river. \"All right,\" said the sergeant. \"March.\"\nWe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. \"You are expected\non board,\" said the sergeant to my convict; \"they know you are coming.\nDon't straggle, my man. Close up here.\"\nThe two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate\nguard. I had hold of Joe's hand now, and Joe carried one of the\ntorches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to\nsee it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good\npath now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and\nthere where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy\nsluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming\nin after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon\nthe track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I\ncould see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air\nabout us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather\nto like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We\ncould not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,\nthat two or three times we had to halt while they rested.",

Then, we went into the hut, where there was\na smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a\nstand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\novergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a\ndozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in\ntheir great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their\nheads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant\nmade some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the\nconvict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,\nto go on board first.\nMy convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the\nhut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up\nhis feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if\nhe pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the\nsergeant, and remarked,\u2014\n\"I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some\npersons laying under suspicion alonger me.\"\n\"You can say what you like,\" returned the sergeant, standing coolly\nlooking at him with his arms folded, \"but you have no call to say it\nhere. You'll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about\nit, before it's done with, you know.\"\n\"I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can't\nstarve; at least _I_ can't. I took some wittles, up at the willage over\nyonder,\u2014where the church stands a'most out on the marshes.\"\n\"You mean stole,\" said the sergeant.\n\"And I'll tell you where from. From the blacksmith's.\"\n\"Halloa!\" said the sergeant, staring at Joe.\n\"Halloa, Pip!\" said Joe, staring at me.\n\"It was some broken wittles\u2014that's what it was\u2014and a dram of liquor,\nand a pie.\"\n\"Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?\" asked\nthe sergeant, confidentially.\n\"My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don't you know,\nPip?\"\n\"So,\" said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and\nwithout the least glance at me,\u2014\"so you're the blacksmith, are you?\nThan I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.\"\n\"God knows you're welcome to it,\u2014so far as it was ever mine,\" returned\nJoe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. \"We don't know what you\nhave done, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor\nmiserable fellow-creatur.\u2014Would us, Pip?\"\nThe something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man's throat\nagain, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard\nwere ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough\nstakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a\ncrew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or\ninterested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or\nspoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,",

An't you?\"\n\"I should like to be,\" said I, glancing at the slate as he held it;\nwith a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.\n\"Why, here's a J,\" said Joe, \"and a O equal to anythink! Here's a J and\na O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.\"\n[Illustration]\nI had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this\nmonosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I\naccidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit\nhis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to\nembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I\nshould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, \"Ah! But read the\nrest, Jo.\"\n\"The rest, eh, Pip?\" said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching\neye, \"One, two, three. Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three\nJ-O, Joes in it, Pip!\"\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the\nwhole letter.\n\"Astonishing!\" said Joe, when I had finished. \"You ARE a scholar.\"\n\"How do you spell Gargery, Joe?\" I asked him, with a modest patronage.\n\"I don't spell it at all,\" said Joe.\n\"But supposing you did?\"\n\"It _can't_ be supposed,\" said Joe. \"Tho' I'm uncommon fond of reading,\ntoo.\"\n\"Are you, Joe?\"\n\"On-common. Give me,\" said Joe, \"a good book, or a good newspaper, and\nsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!\" he\ncontinued, after rubbing his knees a little, \"when you _do_ come to a J\nand a O, and says you, 'Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,' how interesting\nreading is!\"\nI derived from this, that Joe's education, like Steam, was yet in its\ninfancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,\u2014\n\"Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\"\n\"No, Pip.\"\n\"Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\"\n\"Well, Pip,\" said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his\nusual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire\nbetween the lower bars; \"I'll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given\nto drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my\nmother, most onmerciful. It were a'most the only hammering he did,\nindeed, 'xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only to\nbe equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his\nanwil.\u2014You're a listening and understanding, Pip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\n\"Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several\ntimes; and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd say, \"Joe,\"\nshe'd say, \"now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,\" and\nshe'd put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that\nhe couldn't abear to be without us. So, he'd come with a most\ntremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where\nwe was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us\nand to give us up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us.\nWhich, you see, Pip,\" said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the\nfire, and looking at me, \"were a drawback on my learning.\"\n\"Certainly, poor Joe!\"\n\"Though mind you, Pip,\" said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the\npoker on the top bar, \"rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining\nequal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his\nhart, don't you see?\"\nI didn't see; but I didn't say so.",

You're right, old chap! When I\ngot acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing\nyou up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,\nalong with all the folks.

God bless the poor little\nchild,' I said to your sister, 'there's room for _him_ at the forge!'\"\nI broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:\nwho dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, \"Ever the best of friends;\nan't us, Pip? Don't cry, old chap!\"\nWhen this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:\u2014\n\"Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That's about where it lights;\nhere we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I\ntell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn't\nsee too much of what we're up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the\nsly. And why on the sly? I'll tell you why, Pip.\"\nHe had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could\nhave proceeded in his demonstration.\n\"Your sister is given to government.\"\n\"Given to government, Joe?\" I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea\n(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a\nfavour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.\n\"Given to government,\" said Joe. \"Which I meantersay the government of\nyou and myself.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"And she an't over partial to having scholars on the premises,\" Joe\ncontinued, \"and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a\nscholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don't you\nsee?\"\nI was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as \"Why\u2014\"\nwhen Joe stopped me.\n\"Stay a bit. I know what you're a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I\ndon't deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I\ndon't deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down\nupon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page,\nPip,\" Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, \"candour\ncompels fur to admit that she is a Buster.\"\nJoe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital\nBs.\n\"Why don't I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off,\nPip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might\nfeel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that\nplacid occupation; \"your sister's a master-mind. A master-mind.\"\n\"What's that?\" I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But\nJoe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely\nstopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,\n\"Her.\"\n\"And I ain't a master-mind,\" Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,\nand got back to his whisker. \"And last of all, Pip,\u2014and this I want to\nsay very serious to you, old chap,\u2014I see so much in my poor mother, of\na woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never\ngetting no peace in her mortal days, that I'm dead afeerd of going\nwrong in the way of not doing what's right by a woman, and I'd fur\nrather of the two go wrong the t'other way, and be a little\nill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I\nwish there warn't no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it\nall on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and\nI hope you'll overlook shortcomings.\"\nYoung as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from\nthat night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,\nafterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about\nhim, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up\nto Joe in my heart.",

It appeared to me that he must be\na very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop;\nand I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and\nsaw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds\nand bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and\nbloom.\nIt was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this\nspeculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in\nan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the\nbedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\neyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\nbetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\nhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about the\ncorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and\nflavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I\nhardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for\nnoticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by\nlooking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact\n_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to\nget on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating\nthe baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,\nwho stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always\nporing over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and\nalways inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the\nglass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the\nHigh Street whose trade engaged his attention.\nMr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlour\nbehind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of\nbread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered\nMr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my\nsister's idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be\nimparted to my diet,\u2014besides giving me as much crumb as possible in\ncombination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm\nwater into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the\nmilk out altogether,\u2014his conversation consisted of nothing but\narithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,\npompously, \"Seven times nine, boy?\" And how should _I_ be able to\nanswer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I\nwas hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum\nthat lasted all through the breakfast. \"Seven?\" \"And four?\" \"And\neight?\" \"And six?\" \"And two?\" \"And ten?\" And so on. And after each\nfigure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a\nsup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,\nand eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)\na gorging and gormandizing manner.\nFor such reasons, I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started",

However, the only\nthing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told\nfrom within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a\npretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of\ndaylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed\nfrom the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite\nunknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded\nlooking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady's\ndressing-table.\nWhether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\nfine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow\nresting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the\nstrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\nShe was dressed in rich materials,\u2014satins, and lace, and silks,\u2014all of\nwhite. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent\nfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was\nwhite. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and\nsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid\nthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.\nShe had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,\u2014the\nother was on the table near her hand,\u2014her veil was but half arranged,",

But I\nsaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been\nwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw\nthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and\nlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\nsunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\nof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\nshrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly\nwaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage\nlying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\nto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\na vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to\nhave dark eyes that moved and looked at me.

There, there!\" with an impatient movement\nof the fingers of her right hand; \"play, play, play!\"\nFor a moment, with the fear of my sister's working me before my eyes, I\nhad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed\ncharacter of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart. But I felt myself so\nunequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss\nHavisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as\nshe said, when we had taken a good look at each other,\u2014\n\"Are you sullen and obstinate?\"\n\"No, ma'am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can't play just\nnow. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so\nI would do it if I could; but it's so new here, and so strange, and so\nfine,\u2014and melancholy\u2014.\" I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had\nalready said it, and we took another look at each other.\nBefore she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the\ndress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in\nthe looking-glass.\n\"So new to him,\" she muttered, \"so old to me; so strange to him, so\nfamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.\"\nAs she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she\nwas still talking to herself, and kept quiet.\n\"Call Estella,\" she repeated, flashing a look at me. \"You can do that.\nCall Estella. At the door.\"\nTo stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,\nbawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor\nresponsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,\nwas almost as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and\nher light came along the dark passage like a star.\nMiss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the\ntable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\npretty brown hair. \"Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it\nwell. Let me see you play cards with this boy.\"\n\"With this boy? Why, he is a common labouring-boy!\"\nI thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,\u2014only it seemed so\nunlikely,\u2014\"Well? You can break his heart.\"\n\"What do you play, boy?\" asked Estella of myself, with the greatest\ndisdain.\n\"Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.\"\n\"Beggar him,\" said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.\nIt was then I began to understand that everything in the room had\nstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that\nMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\ntaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the\ndressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now\nyellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the\nshoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now\nyellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything,\nthis standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the\nwithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like\ngrave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.\nSo she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\ntrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew\nnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies\nburied in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being\ndistinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have\nlooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have\nstruck her to dust.\n\"He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!\" said Estella with disdain,\nbefore our first game was out. \"And what coarse hands he has! And what\nthick boots!\"\nI had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to\nconsider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so\nstrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.\nShe won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I\nknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for\na stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.\n\"You say nothing of her,\" remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked\non. \"She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her.

This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she\ngave a contemptuous toss\u2014but with a sense, I thought, of having made\ntoo sure that I was so wounded\u2014and left me.\nBut when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face\nin, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my\nsleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.\nAs I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so\nbitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,\nthat needed counteraction.\nMy sister's bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in\nwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be\nonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is\nsmall, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many\nhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within\nmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with\ninjustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my\nsister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had\ncherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave\nher no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments,\ndisgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had\nnursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a\nsolitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was\nmorally timid and very sensitive.\nI got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\nbrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my\nface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat\nwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon\nin spirits to look about me.\nTo be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the\nbrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\nwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there\nhad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no\npigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,\nno malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper\nor the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have\nevaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a\nwilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of\nbetter days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as\na sample of the beer that was gone,\u2014and in this respect I remember\nthose recluses as being like most others.\nBehind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\nwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\nto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\nhouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\na track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes\nwalked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But\nshe seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation\npresented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking\non them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,\nand held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never\nlooked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery\nitself,\u2014by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used\nto make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I\nfirst went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the\ndoor looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and\nascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,\nas if she were going out into the sky.\nIt was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\nto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\nstranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes\u2014a little dimmed by\nlooking up at the frosty light\u2014towards a great wooden beam in a low\nnook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\nhanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one\nshoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\nMiss Havisham's, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\nshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and\nin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\nbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\nwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.",

She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I\nthought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.\nShe gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that\nmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the\ngate, and stood holding it.

And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes\nand mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat\nheaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.\n\"Well, boy,\" Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the\nchair of honour by the fire. \"How did you get on up town?\"\nI answered, \"Pretty well, sir,\" and my sister shook her fist at me.\n\"Pretty well?\" Mr. Pumblechook repeated. \"Pretty well is no answer.\nTell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?\"\nWhitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy\nperhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my\nobstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered\nas if I had discovered a new idea, \"I mean pretty well.\"\nMy sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,\u2014I\nhad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,\u2014when Mr.\nPumblechook interposed with \"No! Don't lose your temper. Leave this lad\nto me, ma'am; leave this lad to me.\" Mr. Pumblechook then turned me\ntowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,\u2014\n\"First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?\"\nI calculated the consequences of replying \"Four Hundred Pound,\" and\nfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could\u2014which was\nsomewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my\npence-table from \"twelve pence make one shilling,\" up to \"forty pence\nmake three and fourpence,\" and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had\ndone for me, \"_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?\" To which I\nreplied, after a long interval of reflection, \"I don't know.\" And I was\nso aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.\nMr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, and\nsaid, \"Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for\ninstance?\"\n\"Yes!\" said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was\nhighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and\nbrought him to a dead stop.\n\"Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?\" Mr. Pumblechook began again when he\nhad recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\nscrew.\n\"Very tall and dark,\" I told him.\n\"Is she, uncle?\" asked my sister.\nMr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he\nhad never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.\n\"Good!\" said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (\"This is the way to have\nhim! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?\")\n\"I am sure, uncle,\" returned Mrs. Joe, \"I wish you had him always; you\nknow so well how to deal with him.\"\n\"Now, boy! What was she a-doing of, when you went in today?\" asked Mr.\nPumblechook.\n\"She was sitting,\" I answered, \"in a black velvet coach.\"\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another\u2014as they well\nmight\u2014and both repeated, \"In a black velvet coach?\"\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"And Miss Estella\u2014that's her niece, I think\u2014handed her\nin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had\ncake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat\nmine, because she told me to.\"\n\"Was anybody else there?\" asked Mr. Pumblechook.\n\"Four dogs,\" said I.\n\"Large or small?\"\n\"Immense,\" said I. \"And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver\nbasket.\"\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter\namazement. I was perfectly frantic,\u2014a reckless witness under the\ntorture,\u2014and would have told them anything.\n\"Where _was_ this coach, in the name of gracious?\" asked my sister.\n\"In Miss Havisham's room.\" They stared again. \"But there weren't any\nhorses to it.\" I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting\nfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of\nharnessing.\n\"Can this be possible, uncle?\" asked Mrs. Joe. \"What can the boy mean?\"\n\"I'll tell you, Mum,\" said Mr. Pumblechook. \"My opinion is, it's a\nsedan-chair. She's flighty, you know,\u2014very flighty,\u2014quite flighty\nenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.\"\n\"Did you ever see her in it, uncle?\" asked Mrs. Joe.\n\"How could I,\" he returned, forced to the admission, \"when I never see\nher in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!\"\n\"Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?\"\n\"Why, don't you know,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, \"that when I have\nbeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the\ndoor has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don't say you\ndon't know _that_, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did\nyou play at, boy?\"\n\"We played with flags,\" I said. (I beg to observe that I think of\nmyself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)\n\"Flags!\" echoed my sister.\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and\nMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out\nat the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.\"\n\"Swords!\" repeated my sister. \"Where did you get swords from?\"\n\"Out of a cupboard,\" said I. \"And I saw pistols in it,\u2014and jam,\u2014and\npills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up\nwith candles.\"\n\"That's true, Mum,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. \"That's the\nstate of the case, for that much I've seen myself.\" And then they both\nstared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\ncountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers\nwith my right hand.\nIf they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have\nbetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that\nthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement\nbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\nin the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the\nmarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I\nescaped. The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to\nhave a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own\nmind than for the gratification of his, related my pretended\nexperiences.\nNow, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\nkitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only\nas regarded him,\u2014not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards\nJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\ndebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham's\nacquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would \"do\nsomething\" for me; their doubts related to the form that something\nwould take. My sister stood out for \"property.\" Mr. Pumblechook was in\nfavour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel\ntrade,\u2014say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the\ndeepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I\nmight only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the\nveal-cutlets. \"If a fool's head can't express better opinions than\nthat,\" said my sister, \"and you have got any work to do, you had better\ngo and do it.\" So he went.",

Then I said, \"Before the fire goes out, Joe, I\nshould like to tell you something.\"\n\"Should you, Pip?\" said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\n\"Then tell us. What is it, Pip?\"\n\"Joe,\" said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\nit between my finger and thumb, \"you remember all that about Miss\nHavisham's?\"\n\"Remember?\" said Joe. \"I believe you! Wonderful!\"\n\"It's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true.\"\n\"What are you telling of, Pip?\" cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\namazement. \"You don't mean to say it's\u2014\"\n\"Yes I do; it's lies, Joe.\"\n\"But not all of it? Why sure you don't mean to say, Pip, that there was\nno black welwet co\u2014eh?\" For, I stood shaking my head. \"But at least\nthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,\" said Joe, persuasively, \"if there\nwarn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?\"\n\"No, Joe.\"\n\"A dog?\" said Joe. \"A puppy? Come?\"\n\"No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.\"\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\n\"Pip, old chap! This won't do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect\nto go to?\"\n\"It's terrible, Joe; ain't it?\"\n\"Terrible?\" cried Joe. \"Awful! What possessed you?\"\n\"I don't know what possessed me, Joe,\" I replied, letting his shirt\nsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\n\"but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\nwish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.\"\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been\nable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\nme, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's\nwho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that\nI knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the\nlies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.\nThis was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\nwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\nmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\n\"There's one thing you may be sure of, Pip,\" said Joe, after some\nrumination, \"namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn't\nought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\nthe same. Don't you tell no more of 'em, Pip. _That_ ain't the way to\nget out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don't make\nit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You're oncommon\nsmall. Likewise you're a oncommon scholar.\"\n\"No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.\"\n\"Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I've\nseen letters\u2014Ah! and from gentlefolks!\u2014that I'll swear weren't wrote in\nprint,\" said Joe.\n\"I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It's only\nthat.\"\n\"Well, Pip,\" said Joe, \"be it so or be it son't, you must be a common\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\nhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can't sit and write his acts of\nParliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\nPrince, with the alphabet.\u2014Ah!\" added Joe, with a shake of the head\nthat was full of meaning, \"and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\nAnd _I_ know what that is to do, though I can't say I've exactly done\nit.\"\nThere was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\nme.\n\"Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,\" pursued Joe,\nreflectively, \"mightn't be the better of continuing for to keep company\nwith common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\nones,\u2014which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?\"\n\"No, Joe.\"\n\"(I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\nmightn't be, is a thing as can't be looked into now, without putting\nyour sister on the Rampage; and that's a thing not to be thought of as\nbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a\ntrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can't get to\nbe oncommon through going straight, you'll never get to do it through\ngoing crooked. So don't tell no more on 'em, Pip, and live well and die\nhappy.\"\n\"You are not angry with me, Joe?\"\n\"No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of\na stunning and outdacious sort,\u2014alluding to them which bordered on\nweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,\u2014a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,\ntheir being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.\nThat's all, old chap, and don't never do it no more.\"",

In pursuance of this luminous\nconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's\ngreat-aunt's at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to\nget on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she\nwould impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging\nof girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her\npromise within five minutes.\nThe Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and\nput straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\ncollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\na birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,\nthe pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand\nto hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a\nlittle spelling,\u2014that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils\nthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the\nsubject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the\nhardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a\nrush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they\nhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more\nillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have\nsince met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various\nspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part\nof the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between\nBiddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave\nout the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,\u2014or\nwhat we couldn't\u2014in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,\nshrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or\nreverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had\nlasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt,\nwho staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was\nunderstood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into\nthe air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that\nthere was no prohibition against any pupil's entertaining himself with\na slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not\neasy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of\nthe little general shop in which the classes were holden\u2014and which was\nalso Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber\u2014being but\nfaintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle\nand no snuffers.",

            "text": "where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a\nstranger. Joe greeted me as usual with \"Halloa, Pip, old chap!\" and the\nmoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.\nHe was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was\nall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\nmouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\nand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\nnodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\ndown there.\nBut as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\nresort, I said \"No, thank you, sir,\" and fell into the space Joe made\nfor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\nwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg\u2014in a very odd way, as\nit struck me.\n\"You was saying,\" said the strange man, turning to Joe, \"that you was a\nblacksmith.\"\n\"Yes. I said it, you know,\" said Joe.\n\"What'll you drink, Mr.\u2014? You didn't mention your name, by the bye.\"\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. \"What'll\nyou drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, \"to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of\ndrinking at anybody's expense but my own.\"\n\"Habit? No,\" returned the stranger, \"but once and away, and on a\nSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.\"\n\"I wouldn't wish to be stiff company,\" said Joe. \"Rum.\"\n\"Rum,\" repeated the stranger. \"And will the other gentleman originate a\nsentiment.\"\n\"Rum,\" said Mr. Wopsle.\n\"Three Rums!\" cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. \"Glasses\nround!\"\n\"This other gentleman,\" observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\n\"is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\nchurch.\"\n\"Aha!\" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. \"The\nlonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!\"\n\"That's it,\" said Joe.\nThe stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his\nlegs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\nbroad-brimmed traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over\nhis head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he\nlooked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\nhalf-laugh, come into his face.\n\"I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\nsolitary country towards the river.\"\n\"Most marshes is solitary,\" said Joe.\n\"No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\nvagrants of any sort, out there?\"\n\"No,\" said Joe; \"none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don't\nfind _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?\"\nMr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\nbut not warmly.\n\"Seems you have been out after such?\" asked the stranger.\n\"Once,\" returned Joe. \"Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;\nwe went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn't us,\nPip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\nThe stranger looked at me again,\u2014still cocking his eye, as if he were\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,\u2014and said, \"He's a\nlikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?\"\n\"Pip,\" said Joe.\n\"Christened Pip?\"\n\"No, not christened Pip.\"\n\"Surname Pip?\"\n\"No,\" said Joe, \"it's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\ninfant, and is called by.\"\n\"Son of yours?\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\nanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\nthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\ndiscussed over pipes,\u2014\"well\u2014no. No, he ain't.\"\n\"Nevvy?\" said the strange man.\n\"Well,\" said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, \"he\nis not\u2014no, not to deceive you, he is _not_\u2014my nevvy.\"\n\"What the Blue Blazes is he?\" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\nMr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about\nrelationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female\nrelations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and\nJoe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most\nterrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to\nthink he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, \"\u2014as\nthe poet says.\"\nAnd here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he\nconsidered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and\npoke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing\nwho visited at our house should always have put me through the same\ninflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to\nmind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our\nsocial family circle, but some large-handed person took some such\nophthalmic steps to patronise me.\nAll this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\ndown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\nshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\nIt was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\npointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at\nme, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it\nand he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with a\nfile_.\nHe did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe's\nfile, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\ninstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on\nhis settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally\nabout turnips.",

This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded\nme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I\nfound when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.\nIndeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had\nany features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her\nface.\n\"Poor dear soul!\" said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my\nsister's. \"Nobody's enemy but his own!\"\n\"It would be much more commendable to be somebody else's enemy,\" said\nthe gentleman; \"far more natural.\"\n\"Cousin Raymond,\" observed another lady, \"we are to love our\nneighbour.\"\n\"Sarah Pocket,\" returned Cousin Raymond, \"if a man is not his own\nneighbour, who is?\"\nMiss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),\n\"The idea!\" But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea\ntoo. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\nemphatically, \"_Very_ true!\"\n\"Poor soul!\" Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been\nlooking at me in the mean time), \"he is so very strange! Would anyone\nbelieve that when Tom's wife died, he actually could not be induced to\nsee the importance of the children's having the deepest of trimmings to\ntheir mourning? 'Good Lord!' says he, 'Camilla, what can it signify so\nlong as the poor bereaved little things are in black?' So like Matthew!\nThe idea!\"\n\"Good points in him, good points in him,\" said Cousin Raymond; \"Heaven\nforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\nwill have, any sense of the proprieties.\"\n\"You know I was obliged,\" said Camilla,\u2014\"I was obliged to be firm. I\nsaid, 'It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.' I told him that,\nwithout deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\nbreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\nin his violent way, and said, with a D, 'Then do as you like.' Thank\nGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.\"\n\"_He_ paid for them, did he not?\" asked Estella.\n\"It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,\" returned\nCamilla. \"_I_ bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\nwhen I wake up in the night.\"\nThe ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\ncall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the\nconversation and caused Estella to say to me, \"Now, boy!\" On my turning\nround, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went\nout, I heard Sarah Pocket say, \"Well I am sure! What next!\" and Camilla",

He was prematurely bald on the top of his head,\nand had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn't lie down but stood up\nbristling. His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were\ndisagreeably sharp and suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and\nstrong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he\nhad let them. He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight\nthen, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had\nthis opportunity of observing him well.\n\"Boy of the neighbourhood? Hey?\" said he.\n\"Yes, sir,\" said I.\n\"How do _you_ come here?\"\n\"Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,\" I explained.\n\"Well! Behave yourself.

Estella\nleft me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham\ncast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table.\n\"So!\" she said, without being startled or surprised: \"the days have\nworn away, have they?\"\n\"Yes, ma'am. To-day is\u2014\"\n\"There, there, there!\" with the impatient movement of her fingers. \"I\ndon't want to know. Are you ready to play?\"\nI was obliged to answer in some confusion, \"I don't think I am, ma'am.\"\n\"Not at cards again?\" she demanded, with a searching look.\n\"Yes, ma'am; I could do that, if I was wanted.\"\n\"Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,\" said Miss Havisham,\nimpatiently, \"and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?\"\nI could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to\nfind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.\n\"Then go into that opposite room,\" said she, pointing at the door\nbehind me with her withered hand, \"and wait there till I come.\"\nI crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.\nFrom that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had\nan airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in\nthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\nto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed\ncolder than the clearer air,\u2014like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry\nbranches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the\nchamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its\ndarkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but\nevery discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and\ndropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a\ntablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the\nhouse and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece\nof some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily\noverhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,\nas I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its\nseeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with\nblotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some\ncircumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in\nthe spider community.\nI heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\noccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles\ntook no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a\nponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of\nhearing, and not on terms with one another.\nThese crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\nthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\nIn her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,\nand she looked like the Witch of the place.\n\"This,\" said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, \"is where\nI will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.\"\nWith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\nthere and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork\nat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\n\"What do you think that is?\" she asked me, again pointing with her\nstick; \"that, where those cobwebs are?\"\n\"I can't guess what it is, ma'am.\"\n\"It's a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!\"\nShe looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, \"Come, come, come!\nWalk me, walk me!\"\nI made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\nHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\nshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\nbeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\nPumblechook's chaise-cart.\nShe was not physically strong, and after a little time said, \"Slower!\"\nStill, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast.

            "text": "while she said, \"Call Estella!\" so I went out on the landing and roared\nthat name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light\nappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\nand round the room.\nIf only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\nhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn't know\nwhat to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham\ntwitched my shoulder, and we posted on,\u2014with a shame-faced\nconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.\n\"Dear Miss Havisham,\" said Miss Sarah Pocket. \"How well you look!\"\n\"I do not,\" returned Miss Havisham. \"I am yellow skin and bone.\"\nCamilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she\nmurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, \"Poor dear\nsoul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!\"\n\"And how are _you_?\" said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to\nCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss\nHavisham wouldn't stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly\nobnoxious to Camilla.\n\"Thank you, Miss Havisham,\" she returned, \"I am as well as can be\nexpected.\"\n\"Why, what's the matter with you?\" asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\nsharpness.\n\"Nothing worth mentioning,\" replied Camilla. \"I don't wish to make a\ndisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in\nthe night than I am quite equal to.\"\n\"Then don't think of me,\" retorted Miss Havisham.\n\"Very easily said!\" remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a\nhitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. \"Raymond is a\nwitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.\nRaymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings\nand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with\nanxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,\nI should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I\nwish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night\u2014The\nidea!\" Here, a burst of tears.\nThe Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\nhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this\npoint, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, \"Camilla, my\ndear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually\nundermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than\nthe other.\"\n\"I am not aware,\" observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\nonce, \"that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\nperson, my dear.\"\nMiss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated\nold woman, with a small face that might have been made of\nwalnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers,\nsupported this position by saying, \"No, indeed, my dear. Hem!\"\n\"Thinking is easy enough,\" said the grave lady.\n\"What is easier, you know?\" assented Miss Sarah Pocket.\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\" cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\nrise from her legs to her bosom. \"It's all very true! It's a weakness\nto be so affectionate, but I can't help it. No doubt my health would be\nmuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition\nif I could. It's the cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to\nknow I possess it, when I wake up in the night.\" Here another burst of\nfeeling.\nMiss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\nround and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the\nvisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.\n\"There's Matthew!\" said Camilla. \"Never mixing with any natural ties,",

            "text": "\"Come and fight,\" said the pale young gentleman.\nWhat could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question\nsince; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was so\nastonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a\nspell.\n\"Stop a minute, though,\" he said, wheeling round before we had gone\nmany paces. \"I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it\nis!\" In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against\none another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my\nhair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my\nstomach.\nThe bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was\nunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was\nparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit\nout at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, \"Aha! Would\nyou?\" and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite\nunparalleled within my limited experience.\n\"Laws of the game!\" said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to\nhis right. \"Regular rules!\" Here, he skipped from his right leg on to\nhis left. \"Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!\" Here,\nhe dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I\nlooked helplessly at him.\nI was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt\nmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\nhad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to\nconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I\nfollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking\nme if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he\nbegged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned\nwith a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. \"Available for\nboth,\" he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to\npulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a\nmanner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\nAlthough he did not look very healthy,\u2014having pimples on his face, and\na breaking out at his mouth,\u2014these dreadful preparations quite appalled\nme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\nthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for\nbattle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\nadvance of the rest of him as to development.\nMy heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\nminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\nas I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,\nlooking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\nfore-shortened.\nBut, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a\ngreat show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\nsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\nlooking up at me out of a black eye.\nHis spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\nstrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked\ndown; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or\ndrinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in\nseconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air\nand a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at\nlast. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I\nhit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again and\nagain, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head\nagainst the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and\nturned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;\nbut finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the\nsame time panting out, \"That means you have won.\"\nHe seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\ncontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\nso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, \"Can I help you?\"\nand he said \"No thankee,\" and I said \"Good afternoon,\" and _he_ said\n\"Same to you.\"",

I felt\nthat the pale young gentleman's blood was on my head, and that the Law\nwould avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I\nhad incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go\nstalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and\npitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves\nopen to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home,\nand looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and\ntrepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County\nJail should pounce upon me. The pale young gentleman's nose had stained\nmy trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the\ndead of night. I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman's\nteeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I\ndevised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance\nwhen I should be haled before the Judges.\nWhen the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of\nviolence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of\nJustice, especially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush\nbehind the gate;\u2014whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal\nvengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in those\ngrave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:\u2014whether\nsuborned boys\u2014a numerous band of mercenaries\u2014might be engaged to fall\nupon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;\u2014it was high\ntestimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,\nthat I never imagined _him_ accessory to these retaliations; they\nalways came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his,\ngoaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the\nfamily features.",

Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly\nfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger\nto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of\nhim. Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella\ndiscussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more\npotent as time went on.

That ass,\nPumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to\nthis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these\nhands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would\nhave done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of\nmind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before\nhim,\u2014as it were, to operate upon,\u2014and he would drag me up from my stool\n(usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me\nbefore the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,\n\"Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by\nhand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which\nso did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!\" And then he would\nrumple my hair the wrong way,\u2014which from my earliest remembrance, as\nalready hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any\nfellow-creature to do,\u2014and would hold me before him by the sleeve,\u2014a\nspectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.\nThen, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\nabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,\nthat I used to want\u2014quite painfully\u2014to burst into spiteful tears, fly\nat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\nevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.\nIn these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,\nwhile they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that he\nwas not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old\nenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into\nopposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out\nof his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating\nend to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to\nlead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching\nsight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, \"Come!\nthere's enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_'ve given trouble\nenough for one night, I hope!\" As if I had besought them as a favour to\nbother my life out.\nWe went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we\nshould continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss\nHavisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my\nshoulder; and said with some displeasure,\u2014\n\"You are growing tall, Pip!\"\nI thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look,\nthat this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no\ncontrol.\nShe said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at\nme again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and\nmoody. On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was\nover, and I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a\nmovement of her impatient fingers:\u2014\n\"Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.\"\n\"Joe Gargery, ma'am.\"\n\"Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?\"\n\"Yes, Miss Havisham.\"\n\"You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with\nyou, and bring your indentures, do you think?\"\nI signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be\nasked.\n\"Then let him come.\"\n\"At any particular time, Miss Havisham?\"\n\"There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come\nalong with you.\"\nWhen I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister\n\"went on the Rampage,\" in a more alarming degree than at any previous\nperiod. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats\nunder our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we\ngraciously thought she _was_ fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent\nof such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud\nsobbing, got out the dustpan,\u2014which was always a very bad sign,\u2014put on\nher coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not\nsatisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush,\nand cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the\nback-yard. It was ten o'clock at night before we ventured to creep in\nagain, and then she asked Joe why he hadn't married a Negress Slave at\nonce? Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker\nand looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have\nbeen a better speculation.",

Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no\nother and no more.\"\nHow Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I\nknow that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs\ninstead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went\nafter him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the\ngate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the\ndaylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,\n\"Astonishing!\" And there he remained so long saying, \"Astonishing\" at\nintervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming\nback. At length he prolonged his remark into \"Pip, I do assure _you_\nthis is as-TON-ishing!\" and so, by degrees, became conversational and\nable to walk away.\nI have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the\nencounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's\nhe invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what\ntook place in Mr. Pumblechook's parlour: where, on our presenting\nourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.\n\"Well?\" cried my sister, addressing us both at once. \"And what's\nhappened to _you_? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor\nsociety as this, I am sure I do!\"\n\"Miss Havisham,\" said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of\nremembrance, \"made it wery partick'ler that we should give her\u2014were it\ncompliments or respects, Pip?\"\n\"Compliments,\" I said.\n\"Which that were my own belief,\" answered Joe; \"her compliments to Mrs.\nJ. Gargery\u2014\"\n\"Much good they'll do me!\" observed my sister; but rather gratified\ntoo.\n\"And wishing,\" pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another\neffort of remembrance, \"that the state of Miss Havisham's elth were\nsitch as would have\u2014allowed, were it, Pip?\"\n\"Of her having the pleasure,\" I added.\n\"Of ladies' company,\" said Joe. And drew a long breath.\n\"Well!\" cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.\n\"She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but\nit's better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole\nhere?\"\n\"She giv' him,\" said Joe, \"nothing.\"\nMrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.\n\"What she giv',\" said Joe, \"she giv' to his friends. 'And by his\nfriends,' were her explanation, 'I mean into the hands of his sister\nMrs. J. Gargery.' Them were her words; 'Mrs. J. Gargery.' She mayn't\nhave know'd,\" added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, \"whether it\nwere Joe, or Jorge.\"\nMy sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden\narm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all\nabout it beforehand.\n\"And how much have you got?\" asked my sister, laughing. Positively\nlaughing!\n\"What would present company say to ten pound?\" demanded Joe.\n\"They'd say,\" returned my sister, curtly, \"pretty well. Not too much,\nbut pretty well.\"\n\"It's more than that, then,\" said Joe.\nThat fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he\nrubbed the arms of his chair, \"It's more than that, Mum.\"\n\"Why, you don't mean to say\u2014\" began my sister.\n\"Yes I do, Mum,\" said Pumblechook; \"but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good\nin you! Go on!\"\n\"What would present company say,\" proceeded Joe, \"to twenty pound?\"\n\"Handsome would be the word,\" returned my sister.\n\"Well, then,\" said Joe, \"It's more than twenty pound.\"\nThat abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a\npatronizing laugh, \"It's more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her\nup, Joseph!\"\n\"Then to make an end of it,\" said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to\nmy sister; \"it's five-and-twenty pound.\"\n\"It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum,\" echoed that basest of swindlers,",

And there my\nsister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would\nserve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue\nBoar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring\nthe Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.\nIt was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, it\ninscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole\ncompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it\nworse, they all asked me from time to time,\u2014in short, whenever they had\nnothing else to do,\u2014why I didn't enjoy myself? And what could I\npossibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,\u2014when I wasn't!\nHowever, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the\nmost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent\ncontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;\nand, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I\nplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\nto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks.\nMy only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they\nwouldn't let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,\nwoke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the\nevening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins's ode, and threw his bloodstained\nsword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and\nsaid, \"The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it\nwasn't the Tumblers' Arms.\" That, they were all in excellent spirits on\nthe road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and\nasserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive\nbore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by\nwanting to know all about everybody's private affairs) that _he_ was\nthe man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole\nthe weakest pilgrim going.\nFinally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly\nwretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like\nJoe's trade.

What is any visit made for?\"\n\"There is some wisits p'r'aps,\" said Joe, \"as for ever remains open to\nthe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might\nthink you wanted something,\u2014expected something of her.\"\n\"Don't you think I might say that I did not, Joe?\"\n\"You might, old chap,\" said Joe. \"And she might credit it. Similarly\nshe mightn't.\"\nJoe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.\n\"You see, Pip,\" Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, \"Miss\nHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the\nhandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were\nall.\"\n\"Yes, Joe. I heard her.\"\n\"ALL,\" Joe repeated, very emphatically.\n\"Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.\"\n\"Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,\u2014Make a end\non it!\u2014As you was!\u2014Me to the North, and you to the South!\u2014Keep in\nsunders!\"\nI had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to\nfind that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more\nprobable.\n\"But, Joe.\"\n\"Yes, old chap.\"\n\"Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day\nof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after\nher, or shown that I remember her.\"\n\"That's true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\nall four round,\u2014and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four\nround might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of\nhoofs\u2014\"\n\"I don't mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don't mean a present.\"\nBut Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon\nit. \"Or even,\" said he, \"if you was helped to knocking her up a new\nchain for the front door,\u2014or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws\nfor general use,\u2014or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork\nwhen she took her muffins,\u2014or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\nlike\u2014\"\n\"I don't mean any present at all, Joe,\" I interposed.\n\"Well,\" said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly\npressed it, \"if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn't. No, I would _not_. For\nwhat's a door-chain when she's got one always up? And shark-headers is\nopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you'd go\ninto brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can't\nshow himself oncommon in a gridiron,\u2014for a gridiron IS a gridiron,\"\nsaid Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring\nto rouse me from a fixed delusion, \"and you may haim at what you like,\nbut a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your\nleave, and you can't help yourself\u2014\"\n\"My dear Joe,\" I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, \"don't\ngo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any\npresent.\"\n\"No, Pip,\" Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all\nalong; \"and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.\"\n\"Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack\njust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I\nwould go uptown and make a call on Miss Est\u2014Havisham.\"\n\"Which her name,\" said Joe, gravely, \"ain't Estavisham, Pip, unless she\nhave been rechris'ened.\"\n\"I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,\nJoe?\"\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of\nit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received\nwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for\na favour received, then this experimental trip should have no\nsuccessor. By these conditions I promised to abide.",

He never even\nseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by\nmere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his\ndinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the\nWandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention\nof ever coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper's out on the marshes,\nand on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his\nhands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his\nneck and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the\nsluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,\nlocomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or\notherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,\nhalf-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it\nwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.\nThis morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and\ntimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner\nof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was\nnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy,\nand that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe's 'prentice,\nOrlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace\nhim; howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything,",

He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just\ngot a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by\nand by he said, leaning on his hammer,\u2014\n\"Now, master! Sure you're not a-going to favour only one of us. If\nYoung Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.\" I suppose he\nwas about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an\nancient person.\n\"Why, what'll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?\" said Joe.\n\"What'll _I_ do with it! What'll _he_ do with it? I'll do as much with\nit as _him_,\" said Orlick.\n\"As to Pip, he's going up town,\" said Joe.\n\"Well then, as to Old Orlick, _he_'s a-going up town,\" retorted that\nworthy. \"Two can go up town. Tain't only one wot can go up town.\n\"Don't lose your temper,\" said Joe.\n\"Shall if I like,\" growled Orlick. \"Some and their uptowning! Now,\nmaster! Come. No favouring in this shop.

I am all right,\" said gruff Old Orlick.\n\"Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,\" said\nJoe, \"let it be a half-holiday for all.\"\nMy sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,\u2014she was\na most unscrupulous spy and listener,\u2014and she instantly looked in at\none of the windows.\n\"Like you, you fool!\" said she to Joe, \"giving holidays to great idle\nhulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in\nthat way. I wish _I_ was his master!\"\n\"You'd be everybody's master, if you durst,\" retorted Orlick, with an\nill-favoured grin.\n(\"Let her alone,\" said Joe.)\n\"I'd be a match for all noodles and all rogues,\" returned my sister,\nbeginning to work herself into a mighty rage. \"And I couldn't be a\nmatch for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who's the\ndunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn't be a match for the\nrogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and\nthe worst rogue between this and France. Now!\"\n\"You're a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,\" growled the journeyman. \"If that\nmakes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good'un.\"\n(\"Let her alone, will you?\" said Joe.)\n\"What did you say?\" cried my sister, beginning to scream. \"What did you\nsay? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,\nwith my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!\" Each of these exclamations\nwas a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of\nall the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for\nher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she\nconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself\ninto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; \"what was the\nname he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold\nme! Oh!\"\n\"Ah-h-h!\" growled the journeyman, between his teeth, \"I'd hold you, if\nyou was my wife. I'd hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.\"\n(\"I tell you, let her alone,\" said Joe.)\n\"Oh! To hear him!\" cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a\nscream together,\u2014which was her next stage. \"To hear the names he's\ngiving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my\nhusband standing by! Oh! Oh!\" Here my sister, after a fit of clappings\nand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and\nthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,\u2014which were the last stages\non her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete\nsuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.\nWhat could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical\ninterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he\nmeant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether\nhe was man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation\nadmitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence\nstraightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt\naprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in\nthat neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.\nOrlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young\ngentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come\nout of it. Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had\ndropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I\nthink), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was\nrecommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her\nhands in Joe's hair.

I only wanted you to know that I am doing\nvery well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.\"\n\"There, there!\" with the old restless fingers. \"Come now and then; come\non your birthday.\u2014Ay!\" she cried suddenly, turning herself and her\nchair towards me, \"You are looking round for Estella? Hey?\"\nI had been looking round,\u2014in fact, for Estella,\u2014and I stammered that I\nhoped she was well.\n\"Abroad,\" said Miss Havisham; \"educating for a lady; far out of reach;\nprettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you\nhave lost her?\"\nThere was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last\nwords, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a\nloss what to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by\ndismissing me. When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the\nwalnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my\nhome and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by\n_that_ motion.",

            "text": "With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to\nbelieve that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,\nor at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under\nobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\nany one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began\nto reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all\nsides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.\nJoe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a\nquarter after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten. While he was\nthere, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had\nexchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could not\nbe more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into\ndense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been\nbefore nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found\nher struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The\nfire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle\nvery long; the candle, however, had been blown out.\nNothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond\nthe blowing out of the candle,\u2014which stood on a table between the door\nand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and\nwas struck,\u2014was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such\nas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one\nremarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with\nsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were\ndealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\nviolence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when\nJoe picked her up, was a convict's leg-iron which had been filed\nasunder.\nNow, Joe, examining this iron with a smith's eye, declared it to have\nbeen filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the\nHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe's opinion was\ncorroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the\nprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they\nclaimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been\nworn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further,\none of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his\niron.\nKnowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed\nthe iron to be my convict's iron,\u2014the iron I had seen and heard him\nfiling at, on the marshes,\u2014but my mind did not accuse him of having put\nit to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have\nbecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.\nEither Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.\nNow, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we\npicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the\nevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and\nhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against\nhim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with\neverybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if\nhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no\ndispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore\nthem. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in\nso silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could\nlook round.\nIt was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however\nundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered\nunspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I\nshould at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the\nstory. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally\nin the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The\ncontention came, after all, to this;\u2014the secret was such an old one\nnow, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not\ntear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much\nmischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me\nif he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not\nbelieve it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets\nas a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of\ncourse\u2014for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing\nis always done?\u2014and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see\nany such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of\nthe assailant.",

It was characteristic of the police people that they had\nall more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that\nthey had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest\nspirits they had ever encountered.\nBiddy's first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty that\nhad completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made\nnothing of it. Thus it was:\u2014\nAgain and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a\ncharacter that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost\neagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly\nwanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,\nfrom tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the\nsign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my\nsister's ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\nqualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one\nafter another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the\nshape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and\ndisplayed it to my sister with considerable confidence.

Biddy looked thoughtfully at\nit, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked\nthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his\ninitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.\n\"Why, of course!\" cried Biddy, with an exultant face. \"Don't you see?\nIt's _him_!\"\nOrlick, without a doubt!

I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\nlaying it down.\n\"Biddy,\" said I, \"how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\nare very clever.\"\n\"What is it that I manage? I don't know,\" returned Biddy, smiling.\nShe managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\nmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\n\"How do you manage, Biddy,\" said I, \"to learn everything that I learn,\nand always to keep up with me?\" I was beginning to be rather vain of my\nknowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\ngreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have\nno doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\n\"I might as well ask you,\" said Biddy, \"how _you_ manage?\"\n\"No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\nme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.\"\n\"I suppose I must catch it like a cough,\" said Biddy, quietly; and went\non with her sewing.\nPursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\nBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her\nrather an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was\nequally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our\ndifferent sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I\nknew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith\nas I, or better.\n\"You are one of those, Biddy,\" said I, \"who make the most of every\nchance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how\nimproved you are!\"\nBiddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. \"I was\nyour first teacher though; wasn't I?\" said she, as she sewed.",

He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,\nbut used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,\nand convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger,\nI had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he\nwould have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\nBiddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\n\"Don't let him come; I don't like him.\" As I did not like him either, I\ntook the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn't want\nseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\nlaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\ndistance.\nCurious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give\nany account, I asked her why she did not like him.\n\"Oh!\" she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\n\"because I\u2014I am afraid he likes me.\"\n\"Did he ever tell you he liked you?\" I asked indignantly.\n\"No,\" said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, \"he never told me\nso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.\"\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon\nOld Orlick's daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on\nmyself.\n\"But it makes no difference to you, you know,\" said Biddy, calmly.\n\"No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don't like it; I don't\napprove of it.\"\n\"Nor I neither,\" said Biddy. \"Though _that_ makes no difference to\nyou.\"\n\"Exactly,\" said I; \"but I must tell you I should have no opinion of\nyou, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.\"\nI kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances\nwere favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that\ndemonstration. He had struck root in Joe's establishment, by reason of\nmy sister's sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\ndismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as\nI had reason to know thereafter.\nAnd now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated",

While going along, the strange\ngentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of\nhis finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion\nas an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front\ndoor. Our conference was held in the state parlour, which was feebly\nlighted by one candle.\nIt began with the strange gentleman's sitting down at the table,\ndrawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his\npocket-book. He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little\naside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to\nascertain which was which.\n\"My name,\" he said, \"is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am\npretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I\ncommence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice\nhad been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you\nsee me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I\ndo. No less, no more.\"\nFinding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got\nup, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus\nhaving one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.\n\"Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of\nthis young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his\nindentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for\nso doing?\"\n\"Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's\nway,\" said Joe, staring.\n\"Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,\" returned Mr.\nJaggers. \"The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\nanything?\"\n\"The answer is,\" returned Joe, sternly, \"No.\"\nI thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool\nfor his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between\nbreathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"Recollect the admission you have made,\nand don't try to go from it presently.\"\n\"Who's a-going to try?\" retorted Joe.\n\"I don't say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?\"\n\"Yes, I do keep a dog.\"\n\"Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\nBear that in mind, will you?\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\nand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\n\"Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got\nto make is, that he has great expectations.\"\nJoe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\n\"I am instructed to communicate to him,\" said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\nfinger at me sideways, \"that he will come into a handsome property.\nFurther, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\nproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of\nlife and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,\u2014in a word,\nas a young fellow of great expectations.\"",

Joe scooped his eyes\nwith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but\nsaid not another word.\nMr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe the\nvillage idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said,\nweighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:\u2014\n\"Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half\nmeasures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in\ncharge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the\ncontrary you mean to say\u2014\" Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped\nby Joe's suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell\npugilistic purpose.\n\"Which I meantersay,\" cried Joe, \"that if you come into my place\nbull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if\nyou're a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay\nand stand or fall by!\"\nI drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to\nme, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\none whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a-going to be\nbull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when\nJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing any\ninclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory\nremarks. They were these.\n\"Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here\u2014as you are to be a\ngentleman\u2014the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall\nreceive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a\nhackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to\nme. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the\ntrust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now,\nunderstand that, finally. Understand that!\"\nHe was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\non, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\nSomething came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he\nwas going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired\ncarriage.\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.\"\n\"Halloa!\" said he, facing round, \"what's the matter?\"\n\"I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;\nso I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my\ntaking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?\"\n\"No,\" said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\n\"I don't mean in the village only, but up town?\"\n\"No,\" said he. \"No objection.\"\nI thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had\nalready locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and was\nseated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at\nthe burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the\ncoals, and nothing was said for a long time.\nMy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at\nher needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next\nJoe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the\nglowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the\nlonger the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\nAt length I got out, \"Joe, have you told Biddy?\"\n\"No, Pip,\" returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\nknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to\nmake off somewhere, \"which I left it to yourself, Pip.\"\n\"I would rather you told, Joe.\"\n\"Pip's a gentleman of fortun' then,\" said Joe, \"and God bless him in\nit!\"\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\nat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\ncongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\ncongratulations that I rather resented.\nI took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with\nthe grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and\nsay nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in\ngood time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,\nsave that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.\nBiddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work\nagain, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining\nhis knees, said, \"Ay, ay, I'll be ekervally partickler, Pip;\" and then\nthey congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at\nthe notion of my being a gentleman that I didn't half like it.\nInfinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some\nidea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts\nentirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,\nand even repeated after Biddy, the words \"Pip\" and \"Property.\" But I\ndoubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I\ncannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.\nI never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy",

And whenever I\ncaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\noften looked at me,\u2014particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\nwere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\nby word or sign.\nAt those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\ndoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings\nto air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am\nafraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the\nrustic objects among which I had passed my life.\n\"Saturday night,\" said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\nand beer. \"Five more days, and then the day before _the_ day! They'll\nsoon go.\"\n\"Yes, Pip,\" observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\n\"They'll soon go.\"\n\"Soon, soon go,\" said Biddy.\n\"I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\norder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put\nthem on there, or that I'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook's. It\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.\"\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\ntoo, Pip,\" said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese\non it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. \"So might\nWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.\"\n\"That's just what I don't want, Joe. They would make such a business of\nit,\u2014such a coarse and common business,\u2014that I couldn't bear myself.\"\n\"Ah, that indeed, Pip!\" said Joe. \"If you couldn't abear yourself\u2014\"\nBiddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister's plate, \"Have you\nthought about when you'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister\nand me? You will show yourself to us; won't you?\"\n\"Biddy,\" I returned with some resentment, \"you are so exceedingly quick\nthat it's difficult to keep up with you.\"\n(\"She always were quick,\" observed Joe.)\n\"If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\nthat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,\u2014most likely\non the evening before I go away.\"\nBiddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\naffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I\ngot into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a\nmean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,\nfor ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even\nat the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\nbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\nso often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.\nThe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\nthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I\nsaw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or\ntwo in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and\nlight it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me\nthat he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.\nHe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his\npipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew\nthat they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing\ntone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for\nmore, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and\nsat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and\nstrange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the\nloneliest I had ever known.\nLooking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe's pipe\nfloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,\u2014not\nobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\ntogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\nbed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.",

For\ninstance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.\"\nAlthough I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her\neyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.\n\"O, his manners! won't his manners do then?\" asked Biddy, plucking a\nblack-currant leaf.\n\"My dear Biddy, they do very well here\u2014\"\n\"O! they _do_ very well here?\" interrupted Biddy, looking closely at\nthe leaf in her hand.\n\"Hear me out,\u2014but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I\nshall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would\nhardly do him justice.\"\n\"And don't you think he knows that?\" asked Biddy.\nIt was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most\ndistant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,\u2014\n\"Biddy, what do you mean?\"\nBiddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,\u2014and the\nsmell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that\nevening in the little garden by the side of the lane,\u2014said, \"Have you\nnever considered that he may be proud?\"\n\"Proud?\" I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.\n\"O! there are many kinds of pride,\" said Biddy, looking full at me and\nshaking her head; \"pride is not all of one kind\u2014\"\n\"Well? What are you stopping for?\" said I.\n\"Not all of one kind,\" resumed Biddy. \"He may be too proud to let any\none take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills\nwell and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it\nsounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I\ndo.\"\n\"Now, Biddy,\" said I, \"I am very sorry to see this in you.

He was a\nprosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous\nlittle garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let\ninto the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that\nheaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.\n\"Mr. Trabb,\" said I, \"it's an unpleasant thing to have to mention,\nbecause it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome\nproperty.\"\nA change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up\nfrom the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming,\n\"Lord bless my soul!\"\n\"I am going up to my guardian in London,\" said I, casually drawing some\nguineas out of my pocket and looking at them; \"and I want a fashionable\nsuit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,\" I added\u2014otherwise I\nthought he might only pretend to make them, \"with ready money.\"\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened\nhis arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each\nelbow, \"don't hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate\nyou? Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?\"\nMr. Trabb's boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.\nWhen I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his\nlabours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into\nthe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible\ncorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with\nany blacksmith, alive or dead.\n\"Hold that noise,\" said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, \"or\nI'll knock your head off!\u2014Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,\nthis,\" said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out\nin a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand\nunder it to show the gloss, \"is a very sweet article. I can recommend\nit for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you\nshall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!\" (To the boy, and with\na dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant's\nbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)\nMr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\ndeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.\nThen he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. \"And let\nme have none of your tricks here,\" said Mr. Trabb, \"or you shall repent\nit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.\"\nMr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential\nconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an\narticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it\nwould ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished\nfellow-townsman's (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having\nworn. \"Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,\" said Mr.\nTrabb to the boy after that, \"or shall I kick you out of the shop and\nbring them myself?\"\nI selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb's\njudgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.\nTrabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented\nwith it, he said apologetically that it \"wouldn't do under existing\ncircumstances, sir,\u2014wouldn't do at all.\" So, Mr. Trabb measured and\ncalculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest\nspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I\nfelt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\npains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\nto Mr. Pumblechook's on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand\nupon the parlour lock, \"I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be\nexpected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a\nturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem\nit. Good-morning, sir, much obliged.\u2014Door!\"\nThe last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what\nit meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\nhands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\nwas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb's boy.",

It might,\" said the servile Pumblechook,\nputting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, \"to a\ncommon person, have the appearance of repeating\u2014but _may_ I\u2014?\"\nWhen he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. \"Let\nus never be blind,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"to her faults of temper, but\nit is to be hoped she meant well.\"\nAt about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in\nthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.\nI mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes\nsent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I\nmentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,\nand he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he\nintimated, worthy of my confidence, and\u2014in short, might he? Then he\nasked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we\nhad gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he\nhad ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken\nten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he\nnever had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of\nhearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling\nconvinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a\nsensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.\nBy degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask\nmy advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was\nan opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and\nseed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred\nbefore in that or any other neighbourhood. What alone was wanting to\nthe realisation of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.\nThose were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him\n(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through\na sleeping partner, sir,\u2014which sleeping partner would have nothing to\ndo but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine the\nbooks,\u2014and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his\npocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,\u2014it appeared to him that that\nmight be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with\nproperty, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?\nHe had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it\nas my opinion. \"Wait a bit!\" The united vastness and distinctness of\nthis view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake\nhands with me, but said he really must,\u2014and did.\nWe drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and\nover again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don't know what mark), and\nto render me efficient and constant service (I don't know what\nservice). He also made known to me for the first time in my life, and\ncertainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had\nalways said of me, \"That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun'\nwill be no common fortun'.\" He said with a tearful smile that it was a\nsingular thing to think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out\ninto the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwonted\nin the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got\nto the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.\nThere, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook's hailing me. He was a long way\ndown the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to\nstop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.\n\"No, my dear friend,\" said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.\n\"Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without\nthat affability on your part.\u2014May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?\n_May_ I?\"\nWe shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young\ncarter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed me\nand stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the\nroad; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge",

            "text": "I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little\nI possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that\nsame afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want\nnext morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.\nSo, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I\nwent to Mr. Pumblechook's, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to\nMiss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook's own room was given up to me to dress\nin, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My\nclothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new and\neagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a\ntrifle short of the wearer's expectation. But after I had had my new\nsuit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of\nposturing with Mr. Pumblechook's very limited dressing-glass, in the\nfutile endeavour to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being\nmarket morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off, Mr.\nPumblechook was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to\nleave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again before\ndeparting. This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new\narray, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious\nafter all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe's\nin his Sunday suit.\nI went circuitously to Miss Havisham's by all the back ways, and rang\nat the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my\ngloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when\nshe saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned\nfrom brown to green and yellow.\n\"You?\" said she. \"You? Good gracious! What do you want?\"\n\"I am going to London, Miss Pocket,\" said I, \"and want to say good-bye\nto Miss Havisham.\"\nI was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went\nto ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned\nand took me up, staring at me all the way.\nMiss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread\ntable, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore,\nand at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then\njust abreast of the rotted bride-cake.\n\"Don't go, Sarah,\" she said. \"Well, Pip?\"\n\"I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,\" I was exceedingly\ncareful what I said, \"and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking\nleave of you.\"\n\"This is a gay figure, Pip,\" said she, making her crutch stick play\nround me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were\nbestowing the finishing gift.\n\"I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss\nHavisham,\" I murmured. \"And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!\"\n\"Ay, ay!\" said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with\ndelight. \"I have seen Mr. Jaggers. _I_ have heard about it, Pip. So you\ngo to-morrow?\"\n\"Yes, Miss Havisham.\"\n\"And you are adopted by a rich person?\"\n\"Yes, Miss Havisham.\"\n\"Not named?\"\n\"No, Miss Havisham.\"\n\"And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?\"\n\"Yes, Miss Havisham.\"\nShe quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her\nenjoyment of Sarah Pocket's jealous dismay. \"Well!\" she went on; \"you\nhave a promising career before you. Be good\u2014deserve it\u2014and abide by Mr.\nJaggers's instructions.\" She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and\nSarah's countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.\n\"Good-bye, Pip!\u2014you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.\"\n\"Yes, Miss Havisham.\"\n\"Good-bye, Pip!\"\nShe stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my\nlips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came\nnaturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket\nwith triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with\nboth her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly\nlighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.\nSarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen\nout. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree\nconfounded. I said \"Good-bye, Miss Pocket;\" but she merely stared, and\ndid not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the\nhouse, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook's, took off my new\nclothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,\ncarrying it\u2014to speak the truth\u2014much more at my ease too, though I had\nthe bundle to carry.",

            "text": "And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run\nout fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more\nsteadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled\naway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more\nappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I\ndressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my\nsplendour\t until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,\ngraced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish\nwith. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in\nspirits.\nI was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little\nhand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all\nalone. I am afraid\u2014sore afraid\u2014that this purpose originated in my sense\nof the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the\ncoach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of\nthis taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on\nthis last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had\nan impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in\nthe morning. I did not.\nAll night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places\ninstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now\npigs, now men,\u2014never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me\nuntil the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and\npartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in\ntaking it fell asleep.\nBiddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not\nsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\nI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the\nafternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking\nof the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go\ndownstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and\nunstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,\nuntil Biddy called to me that I was late.\nIt was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,\nsaying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,\n\"Well! I suppose I must be off!\" and then I kissed my sister who was\nlaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,\nand threw my arms around Joe's neck. Then I took up my little\nportmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I\npresently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing\nan old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped\nthen, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above\nhis head, crying huskily \"Hooroar!\" and Biddy put her apron to her\nface.\nI walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had\nsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to\nhave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High\nStreet. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very\npeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to\nshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all\nbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave\nand sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the\nvillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, \"Good-bye, O my dear,\ndear friend!\"\nHeaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain\nupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was\nbetter after I had cried than before,\u2014more sorry, more aware of my own\ningratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe\nwith me then.",

His getting on\nhis box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old\nweather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a\nwork of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets\noutside, and ragged things behind for I don't know how many footmen to\nhold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from\nyielding to the temptation.\nI had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a\nstraw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the\nhorses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman\nbeginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop\nwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open\ndoor, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.\n\"How much?\" I asked the coachman.\nThe coachman answered, \"A shilling\u2014unless you wish to make it more.\"\nI naturally said I had no wish to make it more.\n\"Then it must be a shilling,\" observed the coachman. \"I don't want to\nget into trouble. _I_ know _him_!\" He darkly closed an eye at Mr.\nJaggers's name, and shook his head.\nWhen he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the\nascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his\nmind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my\nhand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?\n\"He is not,\" returned the clerk. \"He is in Court at present. Am I\naddressing Mr. Pip?\"\nI signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.\n\"Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn't say how\nlong he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time\nbeing valuable, that he won't be longer than he can help.\"\nWith those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner",

There were not so many papers\nabout, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd\nobjects about, that I should not have expected to see,\u2014such as an old\nrusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and\npackages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly\nswollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed\nchair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,\nlike a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and\nbit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the\nclients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the\nwall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with\nshoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled\nforth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being\nturned out.\nI sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's\nchair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I\ncalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\neverybody else's disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many\nother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have\nthe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what\nwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came\nthere. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's\nfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\nill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\nblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.\nOf course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits\nmay have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and\ngrit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in\nMr. Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts\non the shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.",

As to the result,\nit's a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you\npaid Wemmick?\"\n\"We made the money up this morning, sir,\" said one of the men,\nsubmissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers's face.\n\"I don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it\nup at all. Has Wemmick got it?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said both the men together.\n\"Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!\" said Mr Jaggers,\nwaving his hand at them to put them behind him. \"If you say a word to\nme, I'll throw up the case.\"\n\"We thought, Mr. Jaggers\u2014\" one of the men began, pulling off his hat.\n\"That's what I told you not to do,\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"_You_ thought! I\nthink for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to\nfind you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't\nhear a word.\"\nThe two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind\nagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.",

            "text": "Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was\nlike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in\nstature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have\nbeen imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some\nmarks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been\nsofter and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.\nThe chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment\nover his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them\noff. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his\nlinen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for\nhe wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a\nlady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,\nthat several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were\nquite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering\neyes,\u2014small, keen, and black,\u2014and thin wide mottled lips. He had had\nthem, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.\n\"So you were never in London before?\" said Mr. Wemmick to me.\n\"No,\" said I.\n\"_I_ was new here once,\" said Mr. Wemmick. \"Rum to think of now!\"\n\"You are well acquainted with it now?\"\n\"Why, yes,\" said Mr. Wemmick. \"I know the moves of it.\"\n\"Is it a very wicked place?\" I asked, more for the sake of saying\nsomething than for information.\n\"You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\nplenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.\"\n\"If there is bad blood between you and them,\" said I, to soften it off\na little.\n\"O! I don't know about bad blood,\" returned Mr. Wemmick; \"there's not\nmuch bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by\nit.\"\n\"That makes it worse.\"\n\"You think so?\" returned Mr. Wemmick. \"Much about the same, I should\nsay.\"\nHe wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before\nhim: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the\nstreets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a\nmouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the\ntop of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical\nappearance, and that he was not smiling at all.\n\"Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?\" I asked Mr. Wemmick.\n\"Yes,\" said he, nodding in the direction. \"At Hammersmith, west of\nLondon.\"\n\"Is that far?\"\n\"Well! Say five miles.\"\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\"Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!\" said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me\nwith an approving air. \"Yes, I know him. _I_ know him!\"\nThere was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\nthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways\nat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,\nwhen he said here we were at Barnard's Inn. My depression was not\nalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\nto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\nwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a\ndisembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection\nof shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club\nfor Tom-cats.\nWe entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\nlike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\nit, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the\nmost dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever\nseen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those\nhouses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and\ncurtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable\nmakeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,\nas if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of\nBarnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the\npresent occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy\nmourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,\nand it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and\nhumiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry\nrot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and\ncellar,\u2014rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand\nbesides\u2014addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,\n\"Try Barnard's Mixture.\"\nSo imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great\nexpectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. \"Ah!\" said he,\nmistaking me; \"the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does\nme.\"\nHe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,\u2014which\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\nthemselves without the means of coming down,\u2014to a set of chambers on\nthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\na label on the letter-box, \"Return shortly.\"\n\"He hardly thought you'd come so soon,\" Mr. Wemmick explained. \"You\ndon't want me any more?\"\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\n\"As I keep the cash,\" Mr. Wemmick observed, \"we shall most likely meet\npretty often. Good day.\"\n\"Good day.\"\nI put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he\nthought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\nhimself,\u2014\n\"To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?\"\nI was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\nbut said yes.\n\"I have got so out of it!\" said Mr. Wemmick,\u2014\"except at last. Very\nglad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!\"",

Gradually there arose\nbefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\nmember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\nbreath.\n\"Mr. Pip?\" said he.\n\"Mr. Pocket?\" said I.\n\"Dear me!\" he exclaimed. \"I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\ncoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\ncome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,\u2014not\nthat that is any excuse,\u2014for I thought, coming from the country, you\nmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\nMarket to get it good.\"\nFor a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\nhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think\nthis was a dream.\n\"Dear me!\" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \"This door sticks so!\"\nAs he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\nthe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\nthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\nthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\nthat he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\ndoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start\nout of my head, and as if this must be a dream.\n\"Pray come in,\" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \"Allow me to lead the way. I\nam rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably\nwell till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably\nthrough to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk\nabout London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As\nto our table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied\nfrom our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your\nexpense, such being Mr. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's\nnot by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my\nfather hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take\nit, if he had. This is our sitting-room,\u2014just such chairs and tables\nand carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You\nmustn't give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,\nbecause they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little\nbedroom; rather musty, but Barnard's _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;\nthe furniture's hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the\npurpose; if you should want anything, I'll go and fetch it. The\nchambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan't\nfight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the\nfruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite\nashamed.\"\nAs I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,\nOne, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I\nknew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,\u2014\n\"Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!\"\n\"And you,\" said I, \"are the pale young gentleman!\"",

            "text": "\"Now,\" he pursued, \"concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must\nknow, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her\nfather denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in\nyour part of the world, and was a brewer. I don't know why it should be\na crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you\ncannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was\nand brew. You see it every day.\"\n\"Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?\" said I.\n\"Not on any account,\" returned Herbert; \"but a public-house may keep a\ngentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his\ndaughter.\"\n\"Miss Havisham was an only child?\" I hazarded.\n\"Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she\nhad a half-brother. Her father privately married again\u2014his cook, I\nrather think.\"\n\"I thought he was proud,\" said I.\n\"My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,\nbecause he was proud, and in course of time _she_ died. When she was\ndead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then\nthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are\nacquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,\nextravagant, undutiful,\u2014altogether bad. At last his father disinherited\nhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though\nnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.\u2014Take another glass of wine,\nand excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to\nbe so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it\nbottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.\"\nI had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I\nthanked him, and apologised. He said, \"Not at all,\" and resumed.\n\"Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after\nas a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what\nwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.\nThere were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\nbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a\ndeep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father's\nanger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,\u2014merely breaking off,\nmy dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a\ntumbler.\"\nWhy I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to\nsay. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a\nmuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\nwithin those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he\nsaid in the cheerfullest manner, \"Not at all, I am sure!\" and resumed.\n\"There appeared upon the scene\u2014say at the races, or the public balls,\nor anywhere else you like\u2014a certain man, who made love to Miss\nHavisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,\nbefore you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that\nhe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he\nwas not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a\ngentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a\nprinciple of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever\nwas, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no\nvarnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you\nput on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued\nMiss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe\nshe had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the\nsusceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she\npassionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized\nhim. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got\ngreat sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out\nof a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his\nfather) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband\nhe must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in\nMiss Havisham's counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love\nto be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with\nthe exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or\njealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she\nwas doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too\nunreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily\nordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has\nnever seen her since.\"",

Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct\ninto a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket's children\nwere playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my\ninterests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.\nand Mrs. Pocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but\nwere tumbling up.\nMrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\nher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids\nwere looking about them while the children played. \"Mamma,\" said\nHerbert, \"this is young Mr. Pip.\" Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity.\n\"Master Alick and Miss Jane,\" cried one of the nurses to two of the\nchildren, \"if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over\ninto the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?\"\nAt the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket's handkerchief, and\nsaid, \"If that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!\" Upon which\nMrs. Pocket laughed and said, \"Thank you, Flopson,\" and settling\nherself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance\nimmediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been\nreading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,\nshe fixed her eyes upon me, and said, \"I hope your mamma is quite\nwell?\" This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I\nbegan saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such\nperson I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have\nbeen very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the\nnurse came to my rescue.\n\"Well!\" she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, \"if that don't\nmake seven times! What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!\" Mrs.\nPocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\nrecognition, and said, \"Thank you, Flopson,\" and forgot me, and went on\nreading.\nI found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\nsix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the\nregion of air, wailing dolefully.\n\"If there ain't Baby!\" said Flopson, appearing to think it most\nsurprising. \"Make haste up, Millers.\"\nMillers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by\ndegrees the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a\nyoung ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all\nthe time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\nWe were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\nrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\nnear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\ntumbled over her,\u2014always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\ntheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\nthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\nspeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\nwhich baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\nPocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\nand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\n\"Gracious me, Flopson!\" said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\nmoment, \"everybody's tumbling!\"\n\"Gracious you, indeed, Mum!\" returned Flopson, very red in the face;\n\"what have you got there?\"\n\"_I_ got here, Flopson?\" asked Mrs. Pocket.\n\"Why, if it ain't your footstool!\" cried Flopson. \"And if you keep it\nunder your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here! Take the\nbaby, Mum, and give me your book.\"\nMrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\nlittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\nlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made\nthe second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the\nlittle Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\nUnder these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the\nchildren into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket\ncame out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to\nfind that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression\nof face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he\ndidn't quite see his way to putting anything straight.",

I believe he had been knighted himself for\nstorming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate\naddress engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first\nstone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage\neither the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed\nMrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature\nof things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the\nacquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.\nSo successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\nby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but\nperfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,\nin the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was\nalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to\nmount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing\nthe one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket\nhad taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it\nwould seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the\nknowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing\nto bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that\ndower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket\nthat his wife was \"a treasure for a Prince.\" Mr. Pocket had invested\nthe Prince's treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was\nsupposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.\nPocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,\nbecause she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of\na queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.",

He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he\nreferred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed\nfor any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my\ndestiny if I could \"hold my own\" with the average of young men in\nprosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to\nthe contrary.\nHe advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition\nof such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the\nfunctions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that\nwith intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,\nand should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his\nway of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself\non confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state\nat once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his\ncompact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling\nmine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no\ndoubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no\nsuch excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever\nregard him as having anything ludicrous about him\u2014or anything but what\nwas serious, honest, and good\u2014in his tutor communication with me.\nWhen these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had\nbegun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my\nbedroom in Barnard's Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my\nmanners would be none the worse for Herbert's society. Mr. Pocket did\nnot object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could\npossibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt",

Much as if one\nnostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, he\ncame to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He\nforged wills, this blade did, if he didn't also put the supposed\ntestators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though\" (Mr.\nWemmick was again apostrophising), \"and you said you could write Greek.\nYah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!\"\nBefore putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the\nlargest of his mourning rings and said, \"Sent out to buy it for me,\nonly the day before.\"\nWhile he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,\nthe thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived\nfrom like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood\nbefore me, dusting his hands.\n\"O yes,\" he returned, \"these are all gifts of that kind. One brings\nanother, you see; that's the way of it. I always take 'em. They're\ncuriosities. And they're property. They may not be worth much, but,\nafter all, they're property and portable.

There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you'll\nsay he's a Stinger.\"\nThe piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,\nconstructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an\ningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.\n\"Then, at the back,\" said Wemmick, \"out of sight, so as not to impede\nthe idea of fortifications,\u2014for it's a principle with me, if you have\nan idea, carry it out and keep it up,\u2014I don't know whether that's your\nopinion\u2014\"\nI said, decidedly.\n\"\u2014At the back, there's a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I\nknock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and\nyou'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise.

When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered\nto give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night.

My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with\nhis scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he\ncalled me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends\nwhich Wemmick had prepared me to receive. \"No ceremony,\" he stipulated,\n\"and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.\" I asked him where we should\ncome to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his\ngeneral objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,\n\"Come here, and I'll take you home with me.\" I embrace this opportunity\nof remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or\na dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,\nwhich smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop. It had an\nunusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would\nwash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,\nwhenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his\nroom. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o'clock next day, he\nseemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than\nusual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only\nwashing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And\neven when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,\nhe took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before\nhe put his coat on.",

As we walked along\nwestward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of\nthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he\nnever otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody\nrecognised him.\nHe conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side\nof that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in\nwant of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and\nopened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and\nlittle used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark\nbrown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the\npanelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know\nwhat kind of loops I thought they looked like.\nDinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\ndressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the\nwhole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was\ncomfortably laid\u2014no silver in the service, of course\u2014and at the side of\nhis chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and\ndecanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert.

            "text": "There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\nthat they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,\ntrials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very\nsolid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,\nand there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a\nlittle table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring\nthe office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\nevening and fall to work.\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,\u2014for he and I had\nwalked together,\u2014he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\n\"Pip,\" said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\nthe window, \"I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?\"\n\"The spider?\" said I.\n\"The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.\"\n\"That's Bentley Drummle,\" I replied; \"the one with the delicate face is\nStartop.\"\nNot making the least account of \"the one with the delicate face,\" he\nreturned, \"Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\nfellow.\"\nHe immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to\nscrew discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came\nbetween me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,\u2014but I may have thought her\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\npale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious\nexpression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see\nMacbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked\nto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had\nseen rise out of the Witches' caldron.\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\nat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\nplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\na dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own\nstriking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that\nwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and\na purpose of always holding her in suspense.",

For myself, I found that I was expressing\nmy tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to\nboast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my\nlips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\nIt was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible\nagency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity\nabout this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show\nhow muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in\na ridiculous manner.\nNow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap,\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\n\"If you talk of strength,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"_I_'ll show you a wrist.\nMolly, let them see your wrist.\"\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\nhand behind her waist. \"Master,\" she said, in a low voice, with her\neyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. \"Don't.\"\n\"_I_'ll show you a wrist,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\ndetermination to show it. \"Molly, let them see your wrist.\"\n\"Master,\" she again murmured. \"Please!\"\n\"Molly,\" said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\nat the opposite side of the room, \"let them see _both_ your wrists.\nShow them. Come!\"\nHe took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\nbrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\nside. The last wrist was much disfigured,\u2014deeply scarred and scarred\nacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\nMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\nin succession.\n\"There's power here,\" said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\nwith his forefinger. \"Very few men have the power of wrist that this\nwoman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\nhands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\nstronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.\"\nWhile he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\nhe ceased, she looked at him again. \"That'll do, Molly,\" said Mr.\nJaggers, giving her a slight nod; \"you have been admired, and can go.\"\nShe withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,",

Pray make\nthe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I\ndrink to you.\"\nIf his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,\nit perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose\ndepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,\nuntil he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.\nJaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed\nto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers's wine.\nIn our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,\nand I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some\nboorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free with\nour money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that\nit came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\npresence but a week or so before.\n\"Well,\" retorted Drummle; \"he'll be paid.\"\n\"I don't mean to imply that he won't,\" said I, \"but it might make you\nhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.\"\n\"_You_ should think!\" retorted Drummle. \"Oh Lord!\"\n\"I dare say,\" I went on, meaning to be very severe, \"that you wouldn't\nlend money to any of us if we wanted it.\"\n\"You are right,\" said Drummle. \"I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence.\nI wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.\"\n\"Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.\"\n\"_You_ should say,\" repeated Drummle. \"Oh Lord!\"\nThis was so very aggravating\u2014the more especially as I found myself\nmaking no way against his surly obtuseness\u2014that I said, disregarding\nHerbert's efforts to check me,\u2014\n\"Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what\npassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.\"\n\"_I_ don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,\"\ngrowled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.\n\"I'll tell you, however,\" said I, \"whether you want to know or not. We\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.\"\nDrummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\nit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\nHereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\nI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\nbeing a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\nopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\npersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\nus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,\nDrummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his\npockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and\nwould have flung it at his adversary's head, but for our entertainer's\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\npurpose.\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, \"I am exceedingly\nsorry to announce that it's half past nine.\"\nOn this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\nStartop was cheerily calling Drummle \"old boy,\" as if nothing had\nhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\neven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\nwho remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\nStartop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the\nhouses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.",

On the other hand, Trabb's boy\nmight worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless\nand desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High\nStreet.

            "text": "It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as\nwinter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until\ntwo or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys\nwas two o'clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to\nspare, attended by the Avenger,\u2014if I may connect that expression with\none who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.\nAt that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards\nby stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside\npassengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling\ntheir ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised\nwhen Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were\ntwo convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old\nreason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word\n\"convict.\"\n\"You don't mind them, Handel?\" said Herbert.\n\"O no!\"\n\"I thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?\"\n\"I can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don't\nparticularly. But I don't mind them.\"\n\"See! There they are,\" said Herbert, \"coming out of the Tap. What a\ndegraded and vile sight it is!\"\nThey had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler\nwith them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.\nThe two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their\nlegs,\u2014irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I\nlikewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a\nthick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good\nunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at\nthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts\nwere an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he\nthe Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and\nappeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the\nworld, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller\nsuit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those\nshapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his\nhalf-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on\nthe settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had\nbrought me down with his invisible gun!\nIt was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\nnever seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye\nappraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said\nsomething to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves\nround with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something\nelse. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;\ntheir coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower\nanimals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with\npocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them\nand kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable\nand degraded spectacle.\nBut this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the\nback of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and\nthat there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in\nfront behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had\ntaken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,\nand said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such\nvillainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and\ninfamous, and shameful, and I don't know what else. At this time the\ncoach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing\nto get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,\u2014bringing\nwith them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and\nhearthstone, which attends the convict presence.\n\"Don't take it so much amiss, sir,\" pleaded the keeper to the angry\npassenger; \"I'll sit next you myself. I'll put 'em on the outside of\nthe row. They won't interfere with you, sir. You needn't know they're\nthere.\"\n\"And don't blame _me_,\" growled the convict I had recognised. \"_I_\ndon't want to go. _I_ am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am\nconcerned any one's welcome to _my_ place.\"\n\"Or mine,\" said the other, gruffly. \"_I_ wouldn't have incommoded none\nof you, if I'd had _my_ way.\" Then they both laughed, and began\ncracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.\u2014As I really think I\nshould have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so\ndespised.\nAt length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,\nand that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So\nhe got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into\nthe place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as\nthey could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his\nbreath on the hair of my head.",

I thought what a\nblessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.\nIt is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's\nbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\nsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\nbreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\ndoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,\nin my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.\nThe weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us\nall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way\nHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed\noff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\nand how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\nwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\nquestion up again.\nBut I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I\ncould recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\nshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\nblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\nthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\nwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\nmy own thought, \"Two One Pound notes.\"\n\"How did he get 'em?\" said the convict I had never seen.\n\"How should I know?\" returned the other. \"He had 'em stowed away\nsomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.\"\n\"I wish,\" said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, \"that I\nhad 'em here.\"\n\"Two one pound notes, or friends?\"\n\"Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\nthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says\u2014?\"\n\"So he says,\" resumed the convict I had recognised,\u2014\"it was all said\nand done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\nDock-yard,\u2014'You're a-going to be discharged?' Yes, I was. Would I find\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\none pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.\"\n\"More fool you,\" growled the other. \"I'd have spent 'em on a Man, in\nwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\nnothing of you?\"\n\"Not a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried\nagain for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.\"\n\"And was that\u2014Honour!\u2014the only time you worked out, in this part of the\ncountry?\"\n\"The only time.\"\n\"What might have been your opinion of the place?\"\n\"A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\nmist, and mudbank.\"\nThey both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\ngrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.",

She reserved it for\nme to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark\nrooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down\nthe cobwebs, destroy the vermin,\u2014in short, do all the shining deeds of\nthe young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess.

Estella was the\ninspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course.

According to my experience, the\nconventional notion of a lover cannot be always true.

Once for all; I knew to my\nsorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against\nreason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against\nhappiness, against all discouragement that could be.

I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the\ncourtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its\nrusty hinges.\nBeing at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started\nmuch more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober\ngrey dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of\nporter at Miss Havisham's door.\n\"Orlick!\"\n\"Ah, young master, there's more changes than yours. But come in, come\nin. It's opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.\"\nI entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. \"Yes!\"\nsaid he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards\nthe house. \"Here I am!\"\n\"How did you come here?\"\n\"I come here,\" he retorted, \"on my legs. I had my box brought alongside\nme in a barrow.\"\n\"Are you here for good?\"\n\"I ain't here for harm, young master, I suppose?\"\nI was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my\nmind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my\nlegs and arms, to my face.\n\"Then you have left the forge?\" I said.\n\"Do this look like a forge?\" replied Orlick, sending his glance all\nround him with an air of injury. \"Now, do it look like it?\"\nI asked him how long he had left Gargery's forge?\n\"One day is so like another here,\" he replied, \"that I don't know\nwithout casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.\"\n\"I could have told you that, Orlick.\"\n\"Ah!\" said he, dryly. \"But then you've got to be a scholar.\"\nBy this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one\njust within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the\ncourtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of\nplace usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were\nhanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his\npatchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. The\nwhole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a\nhuman dormouse; while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a\ncorner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was\nfitted up,\u2014as indeed he was.",

When we had\nconversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the\nneglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel\nher about a little, as in times of yore.\nSo, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I\nhad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;\nI, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,\nquite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As\nwe drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,\u2014\n\"I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\nthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.\"\n\"You rewarded me very much.\"\n\"Did I?\" she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. \"I remember I\nentertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.\"\n\"He and I are great friends now.\"\n\"Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nI made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\nlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\n\"Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\ncompanions,\" said Estella.\n\"Naturally,\" said I.\n\"And necessarily,\" she added, in a haughty tone; \"what was fit company\nfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.\"\nIn my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\nintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\nit to flight.\n\"You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?\" said\nEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\ntimes.\n\"Not the least.\"\nThe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\nside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\nhers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\nmore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\nso set apart for her and assigned to her.\nThe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\ninto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\nwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\ncareless look in that direction, \"Did I?\" I reminded her where she had\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, \"I\ndon't remember.\" \"Not remember that you made me cry?\" said I. \"No,\"\nsaid she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe\nthat her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry\nagain, inwardly,\u2014and that is the sharpest crying of all.\n\"You must know,\" said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\nbeautiful woman might, \"that I have no heart,\u2014if that has anything to\ndo with my memory.\"\nI got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\ndoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\nwithout it.\n\"Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,\" said\nEstella, \"and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But\nyou know what I mean. I have no softness there,\nno\u2014sympathy\u2014sentiment\u2014nonsense.\"\nWhat _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\nlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?\nNo. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of\nresemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been\nacquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much\nassociated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will\nproduce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces\nthat are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to\nMiss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,\nthe suggestion was gone.\nWhat _was_ it?\n\"I am serious,\" said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow\nwas smooth) as with a darkening of her face; \"if we are to be thrown\nmuch together, you had better believe it at once. No!\" imperiously\nstopping me as I opened my lips. \"I have not bestowed my tenderness\nanywhere. I have never had any such thing.\"\nIn another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\npointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\nfirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to\nhave seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand,\nagain the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed\nme. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.\nInstantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.\nWhat _was_ it?\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Estella. \"Are you scared again?\"\n\"I should be, if I believed what you said just now,\" I replied, to turn\nit off.\n\"Then you don't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\nsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\nlaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\nof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\ncruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.\"\nHer handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\nnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\nbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it\ncould not have been more cherished in my remembrance.\nThere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\nwe were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\nin her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\nbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my",

            "text": "At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\nthat my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\nwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while\nwe were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\nIt was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in\nthe funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\nchair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and\nbeautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\nThe time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\nand Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\nof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\nstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\ncloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\ndoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful.\nThen, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\nsaid in a whisper,\u2014\n\"Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?\"\n\"Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.\"\nShe drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\nshe sat in the chair. \"Love her, love her, love her! How does she use\nyou?\"\nBefore I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\nat all) she repeated, \"Love her, love her, love her! If she favours\nyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\npieces,\u2014and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,\u2014love\nher, love her, love her!\"\nNever had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\nutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm\nround my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\n\"Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\nto be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\nLove her!\"\nShe said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\nmeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead\nof love\u2014despair\u2014revenge\u2014dire death\u2014it could not have sounded from her\nlips more like a curse.\n\"I'll tell you,\" said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,\n\"what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning\nself-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself\nand against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the\nsmiter\u2014as I did!\"\nWhen she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\nher round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\ndress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck\nherself against the wall and fallen dead.\nAll this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\nwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\nthe room.\nHe always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\npocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\nof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as\nif he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or\nwitness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\ndirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he\nhad this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking\nat us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent\npause in that attitude, \"Indeed? Singular!\" and then put the\nhandkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.\nMiss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)\nafraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever.\n\"As punctual as ever,\" he repeated, coming up to us. \"(How do you do,\nPip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you\nare here, Pip?\"\nI told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\ncome and see Estella. To which he replied, \"Ah! Very fine young lady!\"\nThen he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\nlarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\nwere full of secrets.\n\"Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?\" said he, when\nhe came to a stop.\n\"How often?\"\n\"Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?\"\n\"Oh! Certainly not so many.\"\n\"Twice?\"\n\"Jaggers,\" interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, \"leave my Pip\nalone, and go with him to your dinner.\"\nHe complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\nyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\nand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\ntimes and once.\nI considered, and said, \"Never.\"\n\"And never will, Pip,\" he retorted, with a frowning smile. \"She has\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\npresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\nhands on such food as she takes.\"\n\"Pray, sir,\" said I, \"may I ask you a question?\"\n\"You may,\" said he, \"and I may decline to answer it. Put your\nquestion.\"\n\"Estella's name. Is it Havisham or\u2014?\" I had nothing to add.\n\"Or what?\" said he.\n\"Is it Havisham?\"\n\"It is Havisham.\"\nThis brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\nus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green\nand yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\nmaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\nwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\ntime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\nguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\ntwo ladies left us.\nAnything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\nroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\nhimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella's face once during\ndinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\nbut never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\nlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\nface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a\ndry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,\nhe showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\nextorted\u2014and even did extort, though I don't know how\u2014those references\nout of my innocent self.\nAnd when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that\nreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had\nnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted\nthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass\nagain, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and\ncross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had\nknown the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or\nfour times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he\nsaw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his\nhand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to\ntake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn't answer.\nI think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in\nthe danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her\ncap,\u2014which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,\u2014and\nstrewing the ground with her hair,\u2014which assuredly had never grown on\n_her_ head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss\nHavisham's room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss\nHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels\nfrom her dressing-table into Estella's hair, and about her bosom and\narms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\neyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.\n[Illustration]\nOf the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the\nglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor,\nof the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in\nthe light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out\nlong ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his\ncold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I\ncould never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never\nbear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear\nto see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be\nwithin a foot or two of him,\u2014it was, that my feelings should be in the\nsame place with him,\u2014_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.\nWe played until nine o'clock, and then it was arranged that when\nEstella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should\nmeet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her\nand left her.",

I'm so frightened!\" feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and\ncontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed\nhim, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of\nextreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.\nThis was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced\nanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,\nand indignation, I again beheld Trabb's boy approaching. He was coming\nround a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest\nindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb's with\ncheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became\naware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his\nmotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees\nmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His\nsufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,\nand I felt utterly confounded.\nI had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when\nI again beheld Trabb's boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he\nwas entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my\ngreat-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the\nopposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young\nfriends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his\nhand, \"Don't know yah!\" Words cannot state the amount of aggravation\nand injury wreaked upon me by Trabb's boy, when passing abreast of me,\nhe pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm\nakimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,\nand drawling to his attendants, \"Don't know yah, don't know yah, 'pon\nmy soul don't know yah!\" The disgrace attendant on his immediately\nafterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with\ncrows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was\na blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and\nwas, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.",

As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,\n\"Wretches!\" I would not have confessed to my visit for any\nconsideration.\n\"Mr. Jaggers,\" said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,\n\"has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\nthan any man in London.\"\n\"He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,\" said Estella, in a\nlow voice.\n\"You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?\"\n\"I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I\ncan remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could\nspeak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with\nhim?\"\n\"Once habituated to his distrustful manner,\" said I, \"I have done very\nwell.\"\n\"Are you intimate?\"\n\"I have dined with him at his private house.\"\n\"I fancy,\" said Estella, shrinking \"that must be a curious place.\"\n\"It is a curious place.\"\nI should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\nher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\nthe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden\nglare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive\nwith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out\nof it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in\nlightning.\nSo we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by\nwhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this\nside of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she\ntold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham's neighbourhood until she\nhad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in\ngoing and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\nwhile she remained here? To that she emphatically said \"God forbid!\"\nand no more.\nIt was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;\nthat she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task\nhad needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she\nhad not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should\nhave felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose\nto do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to\ncrush it and throw it away.",

I always thought this was business, this was the way to\nconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\nI know Herbert thought so too.\nWe ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\nsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds\nmight be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the\nmark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of\nink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was\nsomething very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\nI would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in\na neat hand, the heading, \"Memorandum of Pip's debts\"; with Barnard's\nInn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet\nof paper, and write across it with similar formalities, \"Memorandum of\nHerbert's debts.\"\nEach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\nwhich had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\nburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\notherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us\nexceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to\ndistinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually\npaying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things\nseemed about equal.\nWhen we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?\nHerbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\nmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.\n\"They are mounting up, Handel,\" Herbert would say; \"upon my life, they\nare mounting up.\"\n\"Be firm, Herbert,\" I would retort, plying my own pen with great\nassiduity. \"Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare\nthem out of countenance.\"\n\"So I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance.\"\nHowever, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would\nfall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the\nplea that he had not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the\ncase might be.\n\"Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it\ndown.\"\n\"What a fellow of resource you are!\" my friend would reply, with\nadmiration. \"Really your business powers are very remarkable.\"\nI thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the\nreputation of a first-rate man of business,\u2014prompt, decisive,\nenergetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities\ndown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My\nself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.\nWhen I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,\ndocketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical\nbundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not\nmy administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into\na focus for him.",

Congratulations,\nMr. Pip.\"\nWe shook hands,\u2014he was always a remarkably short shaker,\u2014and I thanked\nhim.\n\"Take a chair, Mr. Pip,\" said my guardian.\nAs I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\nboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time\nwhen I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the\nshelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were\nmaking a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\n\"Now my young friend,\" my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\nbox, \"I am going to have a word or two with you.\"\n\"If you please, sir.\"\n\"What do you suppose,\" said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\nground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,\u2014\"what\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate of?\"\n\"At the rate of, sir?\"\n\"At,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\n\"the\u2014rate\u2014of?\" And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\npocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\nI had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\nany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\nI confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\nseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, \"I thought so!\" and blew his\nnose with an air of satisfaction.\n\"Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Have you anything to ask _me_?\"\n\"Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\nquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.\"\n\"Ask one,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?\"\n\"No. Ask another.\"\n\"Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?\"\n\"Waive that, a moment,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"and ask another.\"\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\nthe inquiry, \"Have-I\u2014anything to receive, sir?\" On that, Mr. Jaggers\nsaid, triumphantly, \"I thought we should come to it!\" and called to\nWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it\nin, and disappeared.\n\"Now, Mr. Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"attend, if you please. You have been\ndrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's\ncash-book; but you are in debt, of course?\"\n\"I am afraid I must say yes, sir.\"\n\"You know you must say yes; don't you?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"I don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did\nknow, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,\"\ncried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of\nprotesting: \"it's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but you\nwould. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\npiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\nand tell me what it is.\"\n\"This is a bank-note,\" said I, \"for five hundred pounds.\"\n\"That is a bank-note,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, \"for five hundred pounds.\nAnd a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?\"\n\"How could I do otherwise!\"\n\"Ah! But answer the question,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\"You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\nhandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\nday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\nsum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until\nthe donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your\nmoney affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from\nWemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are\nin communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\nagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\ninstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\nI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.\"\nI was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\nliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. \"I am\nnot paid, Pip,\" said he, coolly, \"to carry your words to any one;\" and\nthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\nhim.",

He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office\ncandlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near\nthe door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his\nhat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest\nwith his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.\n\"Mr. Wemmick,\" said I, \"I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\nto serve a friend.\"\nWemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\n\"This friend,\" I pursued, \"is trying to get on in commercial life, but\nhas no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\nbeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.\"\n\"With money down?\" said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\n\"With _some_ money down,\" I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot\nacross me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home\u2014\"with _some_\nmoney down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" said Wemmick, \"I should like just to run over with you on my\nfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as\nChelsea Reach. Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two;\nBlackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.\"\nHe had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\nsafe-key on the palm of his hand. \"There's as many as six, you see, to\nchoose from.\"\n\"I don't understand you,\" said I.\n\"Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,\" returned Wemmick, \"and take a walk upon\nyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\nof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\nyou may know the end of it too,\u2014but it's a less pleasant and profitable\nend.\"\nI could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\nsaying this.\n\"This is very discouraging,\" said I.\n\"Meant to be so,\" said Wemmick.\n\"Then is it your opinion,\" I inquired, with some little indignation,\n\"that a man should never\u2014\"\n\"\u2014Invest portable property in a friend?\" said Wemmick. \"Certainly he\nshould not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,\u2014and then it\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get\nrid of him.\"\n\"And that,\" said I, \"is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?\"\n\"That,\" he returned, \"is my deliberate opinion in this office.\"\n\"Ah!\" said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\nhere; \"but would that be your opinion at Walworth?\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" he replied, with gravity, \"Walworth is one place, and this\noffice is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is\nanother. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments\nmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken\nin this office.\"\n\"Very well,\" said I, much relieved, \"then I shall look you up at\nWalworth, you may depend upon it.\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" he returned, \"you will be welcome there, in a private and\npersonal capacity.\"",

On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union\nJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of\ndefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most\npacific manner by the Aged.\n\"My son, sir,\" said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, \"rather\nhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word\nthat he would soon be home from his afternoon's walk. He is very\nregular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my\nson.\"\nI nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside.\n\"You made acquaintance with my son, sir,\" said the old man, in his\nchirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, \"at his office, I\nexpect?\" I nodded. \"Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand\nat his business, sir?\" I nodded hard. \"Yes; so they tell me. His\nbusiness is the Law?\" I nodded harder. \"Which makes it more surprising\nin my son,\" said the old man, \"for he was not brought up to the Law,\nbut to the Wine-Coopering.\"\nCurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\nreputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\nsprightly manner, \"No, to be sure; you're right.\" And to this hour I\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\nhad made.\nAs I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\nsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his\nown calling in life had been \"the Wine-Coopering.\" By dint of straining\nthat term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on\nthe chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my\nmeaning understood.\n\"No,\" said the old gentleman; \"the warehousing, the warehousing. First,\nover yonder;\" he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\nintended to refer me to Liverpool; \"and then in the City of London\nhere. However, having an infirmity\u2014for I am hard of hearing, sir\u2014\"\nI expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\n\"\u2014Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\nwent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and\nlittle made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to\nwhat you said, you know,\" pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,\n\"what I say is, No to be sure; you're right.\"\nI was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\nimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\non one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\nwooden flap with \"JOHN\" upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\nwith great triumph, \"My son's come home!\" and we both went out to the\ndrawbridge.\nIt was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the\nother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with\nthe greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,\nthat I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had\ncome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he\nwas accompanied.",

Thinking that he\ndid this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I\nseized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\nHaving thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\nhad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\nbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\nwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert's home, and at his character, and\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\nthose, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\nconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\nhave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\nin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the\npossibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the\ncertainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any\nmean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told\nWemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a\ngreat affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some\nrays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience\nand knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my\nresources to help Herbert to some present income,\u2014say of a hundred a\nyear, to keep him in good hope and heart,\u2014and gradually to buy him on\nto some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to\nunderstand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert's\nknowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world\nwith whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his\nshoulder, and saying, \"I can't help confiding in you, though I know it\nmust be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever\nbrought me here.\"\nWemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of\nstart, \"Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is\ndevilish good of you.\"\n\"Say you'll help me to be good then,\" said I.\n\"Ecod,\" replied Wemmick, shaking his head, \"that's not my trade.\"\n\"Nor is this your trading-place,\" said I.\n\"You are right,\" he returned. \"You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,\nI'll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be\ndone by degrees. Skiffins (that's her brother) is an accountant and\nagent. I'll look him up and go to work for you.\"\n\"I thank you ten thousand times.\"\n\"On the contrary,\" said he, \"I thank you, for though we are strictly in\nour private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there\n_are_ Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.\"",

After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins\u2014in the\nabsence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of\nher family on Sunday afternoons\u2014washed up the tea-things, in a trifling\nlady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on\nher gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, \"Now,\nAged Parent, tip us the paper.\"\nWemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that\nthis was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman\ninfinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. \"I won't offer an\napology,\" said Wemmick, \"for he isn't capable of many pleasures\u2014are\nyou, Aged P.?\"\n\"All right, John, all right,\" returned the old man, seeing himself\nspoken to.\n\"Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,\"\nsaid Wemmick, \"and he'll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,\nAged One.\"\n\"All right, John, all right!\" returned the cheerful old man, so busy\nand so pleased, that it really was quite charming.\nThe Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle's\ngreat-aunt's, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\nthrough a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\nthem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\nquite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all\nexpressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\nresumed again.\nAs Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a\nshadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.\nWemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually\nstealing his arm round Miss Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw\nhis hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment\nMiss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm\nagain as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest\ndeliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins's composure\nwhile she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever\nseen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction\nof mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it\nmechanically.\nBy and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and\ngradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\nwiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\nenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\nof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\nof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\nit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading,\nWemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled\nto it by Miss Skiffins.",

I took the\nnext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to\ntake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I\nwas with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such\nplaces.\n\"Are you tired, Estella?\"\n\"Rather, Pip.\"\n\"You should be.\"\n\"Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to\nwrite, before I go to sleep.\"\n\"Recounting to-night's triumph?\" said I. \"Surely a very poor one,\nEstella.\"\n\"What do you mean? I didn't know there had been any.\"\n\"Estella,\" said I, \"do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is\nlooking over here at us.\"\n\"Why should I look at him?\" returned Estella, with her eyes on me\ninstead. \"What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,\u2014to use\nyour words,\u2014that I need look at?\"\n\"Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,\" said I. \"For he\nhas been hovering about you all night.\"\n\"Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,\" replied Estella, with a\nglance towards him, \"hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help\nit?\"\n\"No,\" I returned; \"but cannot the Estella help it?\"\n\"Well!\" said she, laughing, after a moment, \"perhaps. Yes. Anything you\nlike.\"\n\"But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should\nencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is\ndespised.\"\n\"Well?\" said she.\n\"You know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,\nill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.\"\n\"Well?\" said she.\n\"You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\nroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?\"\n\"Well?\" said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her\nlovely eyes the wider.\nTo overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\nfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, \"Well! Then, that is\nwhy it makes me wretched.\"\nNow, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea\nof making me\u2014me\u2014wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;\nbut in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the\nquestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.\n\"Pip,\" said Estella, casting her glance over the room, \"don't be\nfoolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and\nmay be meant to have. It's not worth discussing.\"\n\"Yes it is,\" said I, \"because I cannot bear that people should say,\n'she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest\nin the crowd.'\"\n\"I can bear it,\" said Estella.\n\"Oh! don't be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.\"\n\"Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!\" said Estella, opening\nher hands. \"And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\nboor!\"\n\"There is no doubt you do,\" said I, something hurriedly, \"for I have\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never\ngive to\u2014me.\"\n\"Do you want me then,\" said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and\nserious, if not angry, look, \"to deceive and entrap you?\"\n\"Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?\"\n\"Yes, and many others,\u2014all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I'll\nsay no more.\"",

He had\nno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\npatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that\nconfidence without shaping a syllable.\n\"What,\" said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,\u2014\"what is\nto be done?\"\n\"My poor dear Handel,\" he replied, holding his head, \"I am too stunned\nto think.\"\n\"So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be\ndone. He is intent upon various new expenses,\u2014horses, and carriages,\nand lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.\"\n\"You mean that you can't accept\u2014\"\n\"How can I?\" I interposed, as Herbert paused. \"Think of him! Look at\nhim!\"\nAn involuntary shudder passed over both of us.\n\"Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to\nme, strongly attached to me.

Then again: I am heavily\nin debt,\u2014very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,\u2014and I have\nbeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.\"\n\"Well, well, well!\" Herbert remonstrated. \"Don't say fit for nothing.\"\n\"What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that\nis, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but\nfor the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.\"\nOf course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a\nwarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.",

His right name was Compeyson; and\nthat's the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch,\naccording to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last\nnight.\n\"He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he'd been to a public\nboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was\na dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the\nnight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth\nthat I know'd on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when\nI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a\nsporting one) called him out, and said, 'I think this is a man that\nmight suit you,'\u2014meaning I was.\n\"Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a\nwatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of\nclothes.\n\"'To judge from appearances, you're out of luck,' says Compeyson to me.\n\"'Yes, master, and I've never been in it much.' (I had come out of\nKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have\nbeen for something else; but it warn't.)\n\"'Luck changes,' says Compeyson; 'perhaps yours is going to change.'\n\"I says, 'I hope it may be so. There's room.'\n\"'What can you do?' says Compeyson.\n\"'Eat and drink,' I says; 'if you'll find the materials.'\n\"Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five\nshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\n\"I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on",

Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a\nrich lady some years afore, and they'd made a pot of money by it; but\nCompeyson betted and gamed, and he'd have run through the king's taxes.\nSo, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,\nand Compeyson's wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity\non him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and\nnobody.\n\"I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn't; and I won't pretend I\nwas partick'ler\u2014for where 'ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?\nSo I begun wi' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur\nlived at the top of Compeyson's house (over nigh Brentford it was), and\nCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in\ncase he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled\nthe account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a\ntearing down into Compeyson's parlour late at night, in only a flannel\ngown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson's wife,\n'Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can't get rid of\nher. She's all in white,' he says, 'wi' white flowers in her hair, and\nshe's awful mad, and she's got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she\nsays she'll put it on me at five in the morning.'\n\"Says Compeyson: 'Why, you fool, don't you know she's got a living\nbody? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door,\nor in at the window, and up the stairs?'\n\"'I don't know how she's there,' says Arthur, shivering dreadful with\nthe horrors, 'but she's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,\nawful mad. And over where her heart's broke\u2014_you_ broke it!\u2014there's\ndrops of blood.'\n\"Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. 'Go up alonger this\ndrivelling sick man,' he says to his wife, 'and Magwitch, lend her a\nhand, will you?' But he never come nigh himself.\n\"Compeyson's wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most\ndreadful. 'Why look at her!' he cries out. 'She's a shaking the shroud\nat me! Don't you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain't it awful to see her\nso mad?' Next he cries, 'She'll put it on me, and then I'm done for!\nTake it away from her, take it away!' And then he catched hold of us,\nand kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed\nI see her myself.\n\"Compeyson's wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the\nhorrors off, and by and by he quieted. 'O, she's gone! Has her keeper\nbeen for her?' he says. 'Yes,' says Compeyson's wife. 'Did you tell him\nto lock her and bar her in?' 'Yes.' 'And to take that ugly thing away\nfrom her?' 'Yes, yes, all right.' 'You're a good creetur,' he says,\n'don't leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!'\n\"He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and\nthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, 'Here she is! She's\ngot the shroud again. She's unfolding it. She's coming out of the\ncorner. She's coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you\u2014one of each\nside\u2014don't let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.\nDon't let her throw it over my shoulders. Don't let her lift me up to\nget it round me. She's lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he lifted\nhimself up hard, and was dead.",

As to took up on\nsuspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that\nit lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both\ncommitted for felony,\u2014on a charge of putting stolen notes in\ncirculation,\u2014and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me,\n'Separate defences, no communication,' and that was all. And I was so\nmiserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on\nmy back, afore I could get Jaggers.\n\"When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman\nCompeyson looked, wi' his curly hair and his black clothes and his\nwhite pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.\nWhen the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand,\nI noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the\nevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had\ncome for'ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the\nmoney had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work\nthe thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see\nthe plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, 'My lord and\ngentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your\neyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be\nspoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to\nas such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here\ntransactions, and only suspected; t'other, the elder, always seen in\n'em and always wi' his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is\nbut one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is\nmuch the worst one?' And such-like. And when it come to character,\nwarn't it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn't it his\nschoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn't it him as\nhad been know'd by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to\nhis disadvantage? And warn't it me as had been tried afore, and as had\nbeen know'd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when\nit come to speech-making, warn't it Compeyson as could speak to 'em wi'\nhis face dropping every now and then into his white\npocket-handkercher,\u2014ah! and wi' verses in his speech, too,\u2014and warn't\nit me as could only say, 'Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most\nprecious rascal'? And when the verdict come, warn't it Compeyson as was\nrecommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and\ngiving up all the information he could agen me, and warn't it me as got\nnever a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, 'Once out of\nthis court, I'll smash that face of yourn!' ain't it Compeyson as prays\nthe Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And\nwhen we're sentenced, ain't it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,\nand ain't it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so\nwell, and ain't it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of",

            "text": "Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise\nto go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe\nor his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and\nHerbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be\nabsent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his\nimpatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be\nbegun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert\nalso, that he might be best got away across the water, on that\npretence,\u2014as, to make purchases, or the like.\nHaving thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham's, I set\noff by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out on\nthe open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and\nwhimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of\nmist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly\nride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,\nto look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!\nAs he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a\nvery lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into\nthe coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I\nordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very\nwell knew why he had come there.\nPretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had\nnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of\ncoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which\nit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly\nirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\nfire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my\nhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to\nstir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.\n\"Is this a cut?\" said Mr. Drummle.\n\"Oh!\" said I, poker in hand; \"it's you, is it? How do you do? I was\nwondering who it was, who kept the fire off.\"\nWith that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself\nside by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the\nfire.\n\"You have just come down?\" said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away\nwith his shoulder.\n\"Yes,\" said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.\n\"Beastly place,\" said Drummle. \"Your part of the country, I think?\"\n\"Yes,\" I assented. \"I am told it's very like your Shropshire.\"\n\"Not in the least like it,\" said Drummle.\nHere Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.\nDrummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.\n\"Have you been here long?\" I asked, determined not to yield an inch of\nthe fire.\n\"Long enough to be tired of it,\" returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,\nbut equally determined.\n\"Do you stay here long?\"\n\"Can't say,\" answered Mr. Drummle. \"Do you?\"\n\"Can't say,\" said I.\nI felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle's\nshoulder had claimed another hair's breadth of room, I should have\njerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged\na similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.\nHe whistled a little. So did I.\n\"Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?\" said Drummle.\n\"Yes. What of that?\" said I.\nMr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, \"Oh!\"\nand laughed.\n\"Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?\"\n\"No,\" said he, \"not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the\nsaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way\nvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses\u2014and\nsmithies\u2014and that. Waiter!\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Is that horse of mine ready?\"\n\"Brought round to the door, sir.\"\n\"I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won't ride to-day; the weather\nwon't do.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\"And I don't dine, because I'm going to dine at the lady's.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\nThen, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\ngreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\nexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\nrobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\nhim on the fire.\nOne thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\ncame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\nsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\nhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\nthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle's\nwas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\nstood our ground.\n\"Have you been to the Grove since?\" said Drummle.\n\"No,\" said I, \"I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was\nthere.\"\n\"Was that when we had a difference of opinion?\"\n\"Yes,\" I replied, very shortly.\n\"Come, come! They let you off easily enough,\" sneered Drummle. \"You\nshouldn't have lost your temper.\"\n\"Mr. Drummle,\" said I, \"you are not competent to give advice on that\nsubject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that\noccasion), I don't throw glasses.\"\n\"I do,\" said Drummle.\nAfter glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of\nsmouldering ferocity, I said,\u2014\n\"Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don't think it an\nagreeable one.\"\n\"I am sure it's not,\" said he, superciliously over his shoulder; \"I\ndon't think anything about it.\"\n\"And therefore,\" I went on, \"with your leave, I will suggest that we\nhold no kind of communication in future.\"\n\"Quite my opinion,\" said Drummle, \"and what I should have suggested\nmyself, or done\u2014more likely\u2014without suggesting. But don't lose your\ntemper. Haven't you lost enough without that?\"\n\"What do you mean, sir?\"\n\"Waiter!\" said Drummle, by way of answering me.\nThe waiter reappeared.\n\"Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don't\nride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady's?\"\n\"Quite so, sir!\"\nWhen the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his\nhand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,\ncareful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket\nand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and\nboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without\nintroducing Estella's name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;\nand therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were\nno one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have\nremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for\nthe incursion of three thriving farmers\u2014laid on by the waiter, I\nthink\u2014who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and\nrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we\nwere obliged to give way.\nI saw him through the window, seizing his horse's mane, and mounting in\nhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought\nhe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in\nhis mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-coloured dress\nappeared with what was wanted,\u2014I could not have said from where:\nwhether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,\u2014and as Drummle\nleaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a\njerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching\nshoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me\nreminded me of Orlick.\nToo heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\nno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the\njourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house",

I\nderived that, from the look they interchanged.\n\"And what wind,\" said Miss Havisham, \"blows you here, Pip?\"\nThough she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.\nEstella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and\nthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as\nplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived\nI had discovered my real benefactor.\n\"Miss Havisham,\" said I, \"I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to\nEstella; and finding that some wind had blown _her_ here, I followed.\"\nMiss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,\nI took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her\noccupy.

His being my lawyer, and\nhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same\nrelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that\nas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.\"\nAny one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\nsuppression or evasion so far.\n\"But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least\nyou led me on?\" said I.\n\"Yes,\" she returned, again nodding steadily, \"I let you go on.\"\n\"Was that kind?\"\n\"Who am I,\" cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and\nflashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in\nsurprise,\u2014\"who am I, for God's sake, that I should be kind?\"\nIt was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I\ntold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.\n\"Well, well, well!\" she said. \"What else?\"\n\"I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,\" I said, to soothe\nher, \"in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for\nmy own information. What follows has another (and I hope more\ndisinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you\npunished\u2014practised on\u2014perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\nyour intention, without offence\u2014your self-seeking relations?\"\n\"I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my\nhistory, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\nnot to have it so! You made your own snares. _I_ never made them.\"\nWaiting until she was quiet again,\u2014for this, too, flashed out of her in\na wild and sudden way,\u2014I went on.\n\"I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,\nand have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them\nto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be\nfalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you\nor no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that\nyou deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you\nsuppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and\nincapable of anything designing or mean.\"\n\"They are your friends,\" said Miss Havisham.\n\"They made themselves my friends,\" said I, \"when they supposed me to\nhave superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and\nMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.\"\nThis contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do\nthem good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and\nthen said quietly,\u2014\n\"What do you want for them?\"\n\"Only,\" said I, \"that you would not confound them with the others. They\nmay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same\nnature.\"\nStill looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,\u2014\n\"What do you want for them?\"\n\"I am not so cunning, you see,\" I said, in answer, conscious that I\nreddened a little, \"as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,\nthat I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money\nto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the\nnature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you\nhow.\"\n\"Why must it be done without his knowledge?\" she asked, settling her\nhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.\n\"Because,\" said I, \"I began the service myself, more than two years\nago, without his knowledge, and I don't want to be betrayed. Why I fail\nin my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the\nsecret which is another person's and not mine.\"\nShe gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.\nAfter watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of\nthe slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the\ncollapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again\u2014at\nfirst, vacantly\u2014then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All\nthis time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her\nattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in\nour dialogue,\u2014\n\"What else?\"\n\"Estella,\" said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my\ntrembling voice, \"you know I love you. You know that I have loved you\nlong and dearly.\"\nShe raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her\nfingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved\ncountenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from\nher to me.\n\"I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me\nto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought\nyou could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.\nBut I must say it now.\"\nPreserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,\nEstella shook her head.\n\"I know,\" said I, in answer to that action,\u2014\"I know. I have no hope\nthat I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become\nof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love\nyou. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.\"\nLooking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook\nher head again.\n\"It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise\non the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all\nthese years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected\non the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that,\nin the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.\"\nI saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\nsat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\n\"It seems,\" said Estella, very calmly, \"that there are sentiments,\nfancies,\u2014I don't know how to call them,\u2014which I am not able to\ncomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\nof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\nnothing there. I don't care for what you say at all. I have tried to\nwarn you of this; now, have I not?\"\nI said in a miserable manner, \"Yes.\"\n\"Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.\nNow, did you not think so?\"\n\"I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and\nbeautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.\"\n\"It is in _my_ nature,\" she returned. And then she added, with a stress\nupon the words, \"It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\ndifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can\ndo no more.\"\n\"Is it not true,\" said I, \"that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\npursuing you?\"\n\"It is quite true,\" she replied, referring to him with the indifference\nof utter contempt.\n\"That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\nyou this very day?\"\nShe seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\n\"Quite true.\"\n\"You cannot love him, Estella!\"\nHer fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\n\"What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do\nnot mean what I say?\"\n\"You would never marry him, Estella?\"\nShe looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\nwork in her hands. Then she said, \"Why not tell you the truth? I am\ngoing to be married to him.\"\nI dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\nthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\nher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\nghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my\npassionate hurry and grief.\n\"Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\nfatal step. Put me aside for ever,\u2014you have done so, I well know,\u2014but\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\ngives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\nto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\nlove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as\ndearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can\nbear it better, for your sake!\"\nMy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\nbeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\nintelligible to her own mind.\n\"I am going,\" she said again, in a gentler voice, \"to be married to\nhim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\nmarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\nadoption? It is my own act.\"\n\"Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?\"\n\"On whom should I fling myself away?\" she retorted, with a smile.\n\"Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\npeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\ndone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading me\ninto what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\nwait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\nhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say\nno more. We shall never understand each other.\"\n\"Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!\" I urged, in despair.\n\"Don't be afraid of my being a blessing to him,\" said Estella; \"I shall\nnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\nboy\u2014or man?\"\n\"O Estella!\" I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\nwhat I would to restrain them; \"even if I remained in England and could\nhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle's wife?\"\n\"Nonsense,\" she returned,\u2014\"nonsense. This will pass in no time.\"\n\"Never, Estella!\"\n\"You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.\"\n\"Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\nhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\nin every prospect I have ever seen since,\u2014on the river, on the sails of\nthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the\ndarkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You\nhave been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever\nbecome acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London\nbuildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be\ndisplaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to\nme, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my\nlife, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the\nlittle good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I\nassociate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to\nthat always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me\nfeel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!\"\nIn what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself,\nI don't know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an\ninward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering\nmoments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,\u2014and soon\nafterwards with stronger reason,\u2014that while Estella looked at me merely\nwith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand\nstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of\npity and remorse.",

When I had got into bed, and\nlay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more\nclose my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.\nAnd thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one\nanother.\nWhat a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an\ninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I\nlooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a\nnumber of blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the\nmarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying\nby for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever\ntumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,\u2014a\ndisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable\napproaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\naudible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little\nwashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the\nchest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired\na new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw\nwritten, DON'T GO HOME.\nWhatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never\nwarded off this DON'T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I\nthought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had\nread in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums\nin the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had\nbeen found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that\nhe must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to\nassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door\nto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship\nof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But\nall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\nand when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\nquestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I\nthought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I\nrecalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and\ntones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,\u2014even then I was\npursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don't go home.\nWhen at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a\nvast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present\ntense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do\nnot ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may\nnot and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and\nshould not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and\nrolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the\nwall again.",

I'm going to take a liberty with you. _Would_ you mind toasting\nthis sausage for the Aged P.?\"\nI said I should be delighted to do it.\n\"Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,\" said Wemmick to the\nlittle servant; \"which leaves us to ourselves, don't you see, Mr. Pip?\"\nhe added, winking, as she disappeared.\nI thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse\nproceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged's sausage and he\nbuttered the crumb of the Aged's roll.\n\"Now, Mr. Pip, you know,\" said Wemmick, \"you and I understand one\nanother. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have\nbeen engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official\nsentiments are one thing. We are extra official.\"\nI cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted\nthe Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.\n\"I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,\" said Wemmick, \"being in a\ncertain place where I once took you,\u2014even between you and me, it's as\nwell not to mention names when avoidable\u2014\"\n\"Much better not,\" said I. \"I understand you.\"\n\"I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,\" said Wemmick, \"that a\ncertain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not\nunpossessed of portable property,\u2014I don't know who it may really be,\u2014we\nwon't name this person\u2014\"\n\"Not necessary,\" said I.\n\"\u2014Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good\nmany people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,\nand not quite irrespective of the government expense\u2014\"\nIn watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged's sausage,\nand greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick's; for which\nI apologised.\n\"\u2014By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of\nthereabouts. From which,\" said Wemmick, \"conjectures had been raised\nand theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden\nCourt, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.\"\n\"By whom?\" said I.\n\"I wouldn't go into that,\" said Wemmick, evasively, \"it might clash\nwith official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard\nother curious things in the same place. I don't tell it you on\ninformation received. I heard it.\"\nHe took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set\nforth the Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing\nit before him, he went into the Aged's room with a clean white cloth,\nand tied the same under the old gentleman's chin, and propped him up,\nand put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then\nhe placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, \"All\nright, ain't you, Aged P.?\" To which the cheerful Aged replied, \"All\nright, John, my boy, all right!\" As there seemed to be a tacit\nunderstanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was\ntherefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in\ncomplete ignorance of these proceedings.\n\"This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to\nsuspect),\" I said to Wemmick when he came back, \"is inseparable from\nthe person to whom you have adverted; is it?\"\nWemmick looked very serious. \"I couldn't undertake to say that, of my\nown knowledge. I mean, I couldn't undertake to say it was at first. But\nit either is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being.\"",

But I\ntold him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to\nask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\ndeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\nbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\nnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\nonce, to put my question.\n\"You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\nCompeyson?\"\nHe answered with one other nod.\n\"Is he living?\"\nOne other nod.\n\"Is he in London?\"\nHe gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\nme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\n\"Now,\" said Wemmick, \"questioning being over,\" which he emphasised and\nrepeated for my guidance, \"I come to what I did, after hearing what I\nheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\nClarriker's to find Mr. Herbert.\"\n\"And him you found?\" said I, with great anxiety.\n\"And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\ndetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody\u2014Tom,\nJack, or Richard\u2014being about the chambers, or about the immediate\nneighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\nwhile you were out of the way.\"\n\"He would be greatly puzzled what to do?\"\n\"He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my\nopinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too\nfar out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under\nexisting circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you\nare once in it. Don't break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things\nslacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.\"\nI thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had\ndone?\n\"Mr. Herbert,\" said Wemmick, \"after being all of a heap for half an\nhour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\ncourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\nPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\nbow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\nare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?\"\n\"Not personally,\" said I.\nThe truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\nwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\npresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such very\nmoderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the\nstate of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time\nbefore I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert's\nprospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful\nphilosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not\nbeen very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;\nand thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara's esteem,\nand although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged\nmessages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I\ndid not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.\n\"The house with the bow-window,\" said Wemmick, \"being by the\nriver-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and\nbeing kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished\nupper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that\nas a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very\nwell of it, for three reasons I'll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.\nIt's altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual\nheap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near it\nyourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,\nthrough Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might be\nprudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a\nforeign packet-boat, there he is\u2014ready.\"\nMuch comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\nagain, and begged him to proceed.\n\"Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,\nand by nine o'clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or\nRichard,\u2014whichever it may be,\u2014you and I don't want to know,\u2014quite\nsuccessfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was\nsummoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and\ncornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that\nit was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself\nabout your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off\nand quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;\nand for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last",

For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might\notherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own\ndestruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his\nfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick's judgment\nand sources of information?\n\"Ay, ay, dear boy!\" he answered, with a grave nod, \"Jaggers knows.\"\n\"Then, I have talked with Wemmick,\" said I, \"and have come to tell you\nwhat caution he gave me and what advice.\"\nThis I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told\nhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or\nprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that\nmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping\nclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had\nsaid about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time\ncame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might\nbe safest in Wemmick's judgment. What was to follow that I did not\ntouch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it\nin my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in\ndeclared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by\nenlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled\nand difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it\nwere no worse?\nHe could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\ncoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\nventure. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had\nvery little fear of his safety with such good help.",

I was often out in\ncold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\nout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\nhours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\nLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But\nI knew well enough how to 'shoot' the bridge after seeing it done, and\nso began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to\nErith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were\npulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the\nblind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less\nfrequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single\nword of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there\nwas cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being\nwatched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning\npersons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.\nIn short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in\nhiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to\nstand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,\nand to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards\nClara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,\nand that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going\nswiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.",

Even I myself began to know the\nwant of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve\nit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But\nI had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more\nmoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and\nplans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,\nto hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction\u2014whether\nit was a false kind or a true, I hardly know\u2014in not having profited by\nhis generosity since his revelation of himself.\nAs the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella\nwas married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a\nconviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had\nconfided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her\nto me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of\nhope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you\nwho read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own\nlast year, last month, last week?\nIt was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,\ntowering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a\nrange of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause\nfor fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror\nfresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would\nwith dread, for Herbert's returning step at night, lest it should be\nfleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,\u2014for all that, and\nmuch more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to\ninaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed\nabout in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.",

I was not averse to doing\nthis, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the\nwater-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings\nthat I have now to tell of.\nOne afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the\nwharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide,\nand had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had\nbecome foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back\namong the shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I\nhad seen the signal in his window, All well.\nAs it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort\nmyself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and\nsolitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would\nafterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved\nhis questionable triumph was in that water-side neighbourhood (it is\nnowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that\nMr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the\ncontrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominously\nheard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection\nwith a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen\nhim as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red\nbrick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.\nI dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,\nwhere there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every\nhalf-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the\nknives,\u2014to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the\nLord Mayor's dominions which is not geographical,\u2014and wore out the time\nin dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of\ndinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.",

He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in\nthe cloth, and on that property married a young person in\nbed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of\nPortsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach\nto rub their own hands and shake everybody else's, and sing \"Fill,\nfill!\" A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn't fill, or\ndo anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly\nstated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed\nto two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so\neffectually done (the Swab family having considerable political\ninfluence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then\nit was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white\nhat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a\ngridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down\nfrom behind with the gridiron whom he couldn't confute with what he had\noverheard. This led to Mr. Wopsle's (who had never been heard of\nbefore) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of\ngreat power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all\nto go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down\nthe Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. The\nboatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on\nthe Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your\nHonour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,\nconceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into\na dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that\ncorner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of\nme.\nThe second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in\nthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.\nWopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\ncountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in\nthe manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.\nBut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,\nthe Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,\u2014on account of\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of\nhis daughter's heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a\nflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,\u2014summoned a sententious\nEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,\nafter an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a\nhigh-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.\nThe business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked\nat, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various\ncolours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with\ngreat surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he\nwere lost in amazement.\nThere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.\nWopsle's eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\nmind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat\nthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large\nwatch-case, and still I could not make it out.

I could not doubt, either, that he was there,\nbecause I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger\nthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.\nI put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He\ncould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.\nIt was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to\nidentify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me,\nand known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How\nwas he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,\nin black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I\nbelieved not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no\nespecial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a\nface at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.\nWhen Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I\nextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate\nrefreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was\nbetween twelve and one o'clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates\nwere shut.

Although I should not have\nthought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much\nas a look to Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no\nobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it\nwas not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he\nraised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if\nthere were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.\n\"Did you send that note of Miss Havisham's to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?\" Mr.\nJaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.\n\"No, sir,\" returned Wemmick; \"it was going by post, when you brought\nMr. Pip into the office. Here it is.\" He handed it to his principal\ninstead of to me.\n\"It's a note of two lines, Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, \"sent\nup to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your\naddress. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of\nbusiness you mentioned to her. You'll go down?\"\n\"Yes,\" said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in\nthose terms.\n\"When do you think of going down?\"\n\"I have an impending engagement,\" said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was\nputting fish into the post-office, \"that renders me rather uncertain of\nmy time. At once, I think.\"\n\"If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,\" said Wemmick to Mr.\nJaggers, \"he needn't write an answer, you know.\"\nReceiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I\nsettled that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass\nof wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not\nat me.\n\"So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"has played his\ncards. He has won the pool.\"\nIt was as much as I could do to assent.\n\"Hah! He is a promising fellow\u2014in his way\u2014but he may not have it all\nhis own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to\nbe found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her\u2014\"\n\"Surely,\" I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, \"you do not\nseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?\"\n\"I didn't say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and\nbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be\na question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance work\nto give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such\ncircumstances, because it's a toss-up between two results.\"\n\"May I ask what they are?\"\n\"A fellow like our friend the Spider,\" answered Mr. Jaggers, \"either\nbeats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but\nhe either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick _his_ opinion.\"\n\"Either beats or cringes,\" said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself\nto me.\n\"So here's to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,\" said Mr. Jaggers, taking a\ndecanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of\nus and for himself, \"and may the question of supremacy be settled to\nthe lady's satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady _and_ the\ngentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow",

As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,\nnervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers,\nas she spoke, arrested my attention.\n\"What's the matter?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,\" said I, \"was rather\npainful to me.\"\nThe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood\nlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did\ngo. Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and\nsuch hands on a memorable occasion very lately!\nHe dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those\nhands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I\ncompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and\na stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\nhousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\nme when I last walked\u2014not alone\u2014in the ruined garden, and through the\ndeserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I\nsaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach\nwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\nlightning, when I had passed in a carriage\u2014not alone\u2014through a sudden\nglare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association\nhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\nwanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\nchance swift from Estella's name to the fingers with their knitting\naction, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this\nwoman was Estella's mother.\nMr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed\nthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said\nthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the\nwine again, and went on with his dinner.\nOnly twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the\nroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands\nwere Estella's hands, and her eyes were Estella's eyes, and if she had\nreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less\nsure that my conviction was the truth.",

He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of\nthe Aged and of Miss Skiffins.

Deuce take me,\" he added,\nsuddenly, \"I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.\"\n\"A wild beast tamed, you called her.\"\n\"And what do _you_ call her?\"\n\"The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?\"\n\"That's his secret. She has been with him many a long year.\"\n\"I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in\nbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\ngoes no further.\"\n\"Well!\" Wemmick replied, \"I don't know her story,\u2014that is, I don't know\nall of it. But what I do know I'll tell you. We are in our private and\npersonal capacities, of course.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\nmurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\nwas up, as you may suppose.\"\n\"But she was acquitted.\"\n\"Mr. Jaggers was for her,\" pursued Wemmick, with a look full of\nmeaning, \"and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a\ndesperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and\nhe worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to\nhave made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day\nfor many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial\nwhere he couldn't work it himself, sat under counsel, and\u2014every one\nknew\u2014put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,\u2014a\nwoman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.\nIt was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman\nin Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick\n(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of\njealousy. The murdered woman,\u2014more a match for the man, certainly, in\npoint of years\u2014was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had\nbeen a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched\nand torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,\nthere was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this\nwoman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.\nJaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,\" said Wemmick,\ntouching me on the sleeve, \"that he never dwelt upon the strength of\nher hands then, though he sometimes does now.\"\nI had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\nparty.\n\"Well, sir!\" Wemmick went on; \"it happened\u2014happened, don't you\nsee?\u2014that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her\napprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\nparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a\nbruise or two about her,\u2014nothing for a tramp,\u2014but the backs of her\nhands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?\nNow, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of\nbrambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not\nhave got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles\nwere actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the\nfact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have\nbeen broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little\nspots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made\nwas this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that\nshe was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the\nmurder, frantically destroyed her child by this man\u2014some three years\nold\u2014to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:\n\"We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and\nwe show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and\nyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept\nall consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have\nscratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder\nof her child; why don't you? As to this case, if you _will_ have\nscratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted\nfor them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented\nthem?\" \"To sum up, sir,\" said Wemmick, \"Mr. Jaggers was altogether too\nmany for the jury, and they gave in.\"",

Miss Havisham was\nnot in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.\nLooking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on\nthe hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the\ncontemplation of, the ashy fire.\nDoing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old\nchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes.

As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in\nthe progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked\nfortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me.

I thank you even more for the\ntone of the question. But there is nothing.\"\nShe presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\nfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung\nfrom her neck.\n\"You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?\"\n\"Quite. I dined with him yesterday.\"\n\"This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your\nirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if\nyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it\nto you.\"\n\"Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving\nit from him.\"\nShe read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\nreceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled\nagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\npencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without\nlooking at me.\n\"My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, \"I\nforgive her,\" though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\nit!\"\n\"O Miss Havisham,\" said I, \"I can do it now. There have been sore\nmistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want\nforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.\"\nShe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,\nand, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees\nat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have\nbeen raised to heaven from her mother's side.\nTo see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\ngave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got\nmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of\nmine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and\nwept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that\nthe relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was\nnot kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\n\"O!\" she cried, despairingly. \"What have I done! What have I done!\"\n\"If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me\nanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances.\nIs she married?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nIt was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house\nhad told me so.\n\"What have I done! What have I done!\" She wrung her hands, and crushed\nher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. \"What\nhave I done!\"\nI knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\nthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found\nvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light of\nday, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,\nher mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew\nequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her\npunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this\nearth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become\na master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,\nthe vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been\ncurses in this world?\n\"Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a\nlooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know\nwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!\" And so again,\ntwenty, fifty times over, What had she done!\n\"Miss Havisham,\" I said, when her cry had died away, \"you may dismiss\nme from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and\nif you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\npart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.\"\n\"Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip\u2014my dear!\" There was an earnest womanly\ncompassion for me in her new affection. \"My dear! Believe this: when\nshe first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At\nfirst, I meant no more.\"\n\"Well, well!\" said I. \"I hope so.\"\n\"But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did\nworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,\nand with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and\npoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.\"\n\"Better,\" I could not help saying, \"to have left her a natural heart,\neven to be bruised or broken.\"",

She looked full at me when I said this, and\nreplied, \"Go on.\"\n\"Whose child was Estella?\"\nShe shook her head.\n\"You don't know?\"\nShe shook her head again.\n\"But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?\"\n\"Brought her here.\"\n\"Will you tell me how that came about?\"\nShe answered in a low whisper and with caution: \"I had been shut up in\nthese rooms a long time (I don't know how long; you know what time the\nclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear\nand love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent for\nhim to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the\nnewspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would\nlook about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here\nasleep, and I called her Estella.\"\n\"Might I ask her age then?\"\n\"Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an\norphan and I adopted her.\"\nSo convinced I was of that woman's being her mother, that I wanted no\nevidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I\nthought, the connection here was clear and straight.",

I went all round it; round by\nthe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the\npaths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary\nall!\nTaking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little\ndoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at\nthe opposite door,\u2014not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started\nand swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was\nencumbered with a growth of fungus,\u2014when I turned my head to look back.\nA childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of\nthe slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to\nthe beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam\nshuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,\u2014though to be\nsure I was there in an instant.\nThe mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this\nillusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an\nindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I\nhad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on\ninto the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let\nme out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go\nupstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I\nhad left her. I took the latter course and went up.\nI looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in\nthe ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back\ntowards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly\naway, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw\nher running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about\nher, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.\nI had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.\nThat I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over\nher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same\npurpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,\nand all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the\nground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered\nher, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,\u2014that this\noccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or\nthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the\nfloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were\nfloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded\nbridal dress.\nThen, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\naway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries\nat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like\na prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or\nwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the\nflames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her\ngarments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.",

On the evening of the very\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the\nyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore\nthat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he\nshould never see it again; then she vanished.\u2014There's the worst arm\ncomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right\nhand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light than\nby a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don't see the poor\nblistered patches too distinctly.\u2014You don't think your breathing is\naffected, my dear boy?

Therefore, fearing he should be\ncalled upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause\nof her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept\nhimself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was\nonly vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the\njealousy arose. After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost\nthe child and the child's mother.\"",

And I saw\nWemmick's lips form the words \"portable property.\"\n\"I should _not_ have told her No, if I had been you,\" said Mr Jaggers;\n\"but every man ought to know his own business best.\"\n\"Every man's business,\" said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,\n\"is portable property.\"\nAs I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at\nheart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:\u2014\n\"I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to\ngive me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave\nme all she possessed.\"\n\"Did she?\" said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and\nthen straightening himself. \"Hah! I don't think I should have done so,\nif I had been Miss Havisham. But _she_ ought to know her own business\nbest.\"\n\"I know more of the history of Miss Havisham's adopted child than Miss\nHavisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.\"\nMr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated \"Mother?\"\n\"I have seen her mother within these three days.\"\n\"Yes?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.\"\n\"Yes?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Perhaps I know more of Estella's history than even you do,\" said I. \"I\nknow her father too.\"\nA certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner\u2014he was too\nself-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being\nbrought to an indefinably attentive stop\u2014assured me that he did not\nknow who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis's\naccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;\nwhich I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers's\nclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reason\nfor claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this\nunconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers's part before, though I was quite sure\nof it now.\n\"So! You know the young lady's father, Pip?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"and his name is Provis\u2014from New South Wales.\"\nEven Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest\nstart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the\nsooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the\naction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the\nannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just\nthen, lest Mr. Jaggers's sharpness should detect that there had been\nsome communication unknown to him between us.\n\"And on what evidence, Pip,\" asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he\npaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, \"does Provis make\nthis claim?\"\n\"He does not make it,\" said I, \"and has never made it, and has no\nknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.\"\nFor once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so\nunexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\nwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked\nwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.\nThen I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation\nthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact\nknew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look\ntowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been\nfor some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers's look.

I\nrepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence\nfrom him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said\nthat I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted\nassurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,\nand why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he\ncared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,\nand that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,\nwhatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\nelse in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and\nsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to\nWemmick, and said, \"Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle\nheart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the\ninnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\nlife.

That the\nmother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\nmiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another.

Mr. Jaggers did the same.\n\"Now, Wemmick,\" said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, \"what\nitem was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?\"\nStanding by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the\nodd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times:\nwith this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to\nsay conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional\nlight to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now\ninflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and\nWemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest\npoint in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such ill\nterms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.\nBut they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of\nMike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on\nhis sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance\nwithin those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or\nin that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble\n(which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest\ndaughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this\nmelancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially\nbefore the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike's eye\nhappened to twinkle with a tear.\n\"What are you about?\" demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.\n\"What do you come snivelling here for?\"\n\"I didn't go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.\"\n\"You did,\" said Wemmick. \"How dare you? You're not in a fit state to\ncome here, if you can't come here without spluttering like a bad pen.\nWhat do you mean by it?\"\n\"A man can't help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,\" pleaded Mike.\n\"His what?\" demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. \"Say that again!\"\n\"Now look here my man,\" said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and\npointing to the door. \"Get out of this office. I'll have no feelings\nhere. Get out.\"\n\"It serves you right,\" said Wemmick, \"Get out.\"\nSo, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and\nWemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and\nwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had\njust had lunch.",

Take Startop.

Let him suppose it a mere\nfreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know\nthat there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.\nYou go with him?\"\n\"No doubt.\"\n\"Where?\"\nIt had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the\npoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,\u2014Hamburg, Rotterdam,\nAntwerp,\u2014the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I\nhad always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\nboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\nleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\ndown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\nuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\nlay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\nmade inquiries beforehand.\nHerbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\nHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\nsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\nourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separated\nfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\nHerbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\nwithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o'clock reported it\ndone. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\nStartop, and he was more than ready to join.\nThose two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;\nour charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our\nobject, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not\ncome home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that\nhe should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he\nshould prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on\nWednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the\narrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that\nhe should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on\nboard.",

As I was not able\nto cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for\nme. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain\nme with my own story,\u2014of course with the popular feature that\nPumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.\n\"Do you know the young man?\" said I.\n\"Know him!\" repeated the landlord. \"Ever since he was\u2014no height at\nall.\"\n\"Does he ever come back to this neighbourhood?\"\n\"Ay, he comes back,\" said the landlord, \"to his great friends, now and\nagain, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.\"\n\"What man is that?\"\n\"Him that I speak of,\" said the landlord. \"Mr. Pumblechook.\"\n\"Is he ungrateful to no one else?\"\n\"No doubt he would be, if he could,\" returned the landlord, \"but he\ncan't. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.\"\n\"Does Pumblechook say so?\"\n\"Say so!\" replied the landlord. \"He han't no call to say so.\"\n\"But does he say so?\"\n\"It would turn a man's blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of\nit, sir,\" said the landlord.\nI thought, \"Yet Joe, dear Joe, _you_ never tell of it.

Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!\"\n\"Your appetite's been touched like by your accident,\" said the\nlandlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. \"Try a tenderer\nbit.\"\n\"No, thank you,\" I replied, turning from the table to brood over the\nfire. \"I can eat no more. Please take it away.\"\nI had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as\nthrough the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;\nthe meaner he, the nobler Joe.",

I turned round to do so, and had taken\nup the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent\nshock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in\na strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.\n\"Now,\" said a suppressed voice with an oath, \"I've got you!\"\n\"What is this?\" I cried, struggling. \"Who is it? Help, help, help!\"\nNot only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my\nbad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man's hand,\nsometimes a strong man's breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my\ncries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled\nineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. \"And\nnow,\" said the suppressed voice with another oath, \"call out again, and\nI'll make short work of you!\"\nFaint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the\nsurprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in\nexecution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.\nBut, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt\nbefore, it were now being boiled.\nThe sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black\ndarkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.\nAfter groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he\nwanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the\nsparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and\nbreathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue\npoint of the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,\u2014no\nwonder there,\u2014and one after another the sparks died out.\nThe man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As\nthe sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and\ntouches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending\nover the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,\nbreathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and\nshowed me Orlick.\nWhom I had looked for, I don't know. I had not looked for him. Seeing\nhim, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes\nupon him.\nHe lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,\nand dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away\nfrom him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms\nfolded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to\na stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,\u2014a fixture\nthere,\u2014the means of ascent to the loft above.\n\"Now,\" said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, \"I've\ngot you.\"\n\"Unbind me. Let me go!\"\n\"Ah!\" he returned, \"_I_'ll let you go. I'll let you go to the moon,\nI'll let you go to the stars. All in good time.\"\n\"Why have you lured me here?\"\n\"Don't you know?\" said he, with a deadly look.\n\"Why have you set upon me in the dark?\"\n\"Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than\ntwo. O you enemy, you enemy!\"\nHis enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms",

I\nsaw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;\nthere, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.\n\"And why was Old Orlick there? I'll tell you something more, wolf. You\nand her _have_ pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as\ngetting a easy living in it goes, and I've took up with new companions,\nand new masters. Some of 'em writes my letters when I wants 'em\nwrote,\u2014do you mind?\u2014writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;\nthey're not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I've had a firm mind\nand a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your\nsister's burying. I han't seen a way to get you safe, and I've looked\narter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,\n'Somehow or another I'll have him!' What! When I looks for you, I finds\nyour uncle Provis, eh?\"\nMill Pond Bank, and Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,\nall so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was\nover, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his\nback, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running\nout to sea!\n\"_You_ with a uncle too! Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so\nsmall a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and\nthumb and chucked you away dead (as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times,\nwhen I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you\nhadn't found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for\nto hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old\nOrlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year\nago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a\nbullock, as he means to drop you\u2014hey?\u2014when he come for to hear\nthat\u2014hey?\"\nIn his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I\nturned my face aside to save it from the flame.\n\"Ah!\" he cried, laughing, after doing it again, \"the burnt child dreads\nthe fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was\nsmuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick's a match for you and\nknow'd you'd come to-night! Now I'll tell you something more, wolf, and\nthis ends it. There's them that's as good a match for your uncle Provis\nas Old Orlick has been for you. Let him 'ware them, when he's lost his\nnevvy! Let him 'ware them, when no man can't find a rag of his dear\nrelation's clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There's them that can't\nand that won't have Magwitch,\u2014yes, _I_ know the name!\u2014alive in the same\nland with them, and that's had such sure information of him when he was\nalive in another land, as that he couldn't and shouldn't leave it\nunbeknown and put them in danger. P'raps it's them that writes fifty\nhands, and that's not like sneaking you as writes but one. 'Ware\nCompeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!\"\nHe flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an\ninstant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the\nlight on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and\nBiddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.\nThere was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the\nopposite wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and\nforwards. His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever\nbefore, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his\nsides, and with his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left.\nWild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures\nthat rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand\nthat, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely\nperishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me what\nhe had told.\nOf a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed it\naway. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed\nslowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked\nat me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of\nhis hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and\nswearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw\nin his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.\nThe resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one\nvain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and\nstruggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I\ncould move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until\nthen unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard\nresponsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the\ndoor, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of\nmen, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly\nout into the night.",

            "text": "After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the\nsame place, with my head on some one's knee. My eyes were fixed on the\nladder against the wall, when I came to myself,\u2014had opened on it before\nmy mind saw it,\u2014and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\nwas in the place where I had lost it.\nToo indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who\nsupported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came\nbetween me and it a face. The face of Trabb's boy!\n\"I think he's all right!\" said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice; \"but\nain't he just pale though!\"\nAt these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\nand I saw my supporter to be\u2014\n\"Herbert! Great Heaven!\"\n\"Softly,\" said Herbert. \"Gently, Handel. Don't be too eager.\"\n\"And our old comrade, Startop!\" I cried, as he too bent over me.\n\"Remember what he is going to assist us in,\" said Herbert, \"and be\ncalm.\"\nThe allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in\nmy arm. \"The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\nto-night? How long have I been here?\" For, I had a strange and strong\nmisgiving that I had been lying there a long time\u2014a day and a\nnight,\u2014two days and nights,\u2014more.\n\"The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.\"\n\"Thank God!\"\n\"And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,\" said Herbert. \"But\nyou can't help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can\nyou stand?\"\n\"Yes, yes,\" said I, \"I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\narm.\"\nThey laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen\nand inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they\ntore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully\nreplaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain\nsome cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the\ndoor of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the\nquarry on our way back. Trabb's boy\u2014Trabb's overgrown young man\nnow\u2014went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come\nin at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I\nhad last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.\nThe white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as\nI had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.\nEntreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,\u2014which at\nfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\nquiet,\u2014I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\nchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\nmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was\ngone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\nhour's consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\nvolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.\nFinding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\nresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\nBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\nfinding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's, where they lost me.\nHereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\nI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.\nAmong the loungers under the Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's\nBoy,\u2014true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he\nhad no business,\u2014and Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss\nHavisham's in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's boy became\ntheir guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by\nthe town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went\nalong, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought\nthere on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's\nsafety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be\nmischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and\nwent on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,\nendeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could\nhear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was\nwhile my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I\nwas there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,\nand rushed in, closely followed by the other two.",

But, I had already considered that such\na course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be\nfatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\npresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\nlight of the matter to Trabb's boy; who, I am convinced, would have\nbeen much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his\nintervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb's boy was of a\nmalignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it\nwas in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's\nexpense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed\nto meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an\nill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).\nWednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London\nthat night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be\nclear away before the night's adventure began to be talked of. Herbert\ngot a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this\nstuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear\nits pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,\nand I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.\nMy terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for\nto-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of\nitself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the\nmental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon\nme that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with\nsuch consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.\nNo precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from\ncommunication with him that day; yet this again increased my\nrestlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing\nthat he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me\nso. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was\nsomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the\nfact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days\nwore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,\nmy overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow\nmorning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning\nhead throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to\nhigh numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew\nin prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\nfatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to\nmyself with a start, \"Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!\"\nThey kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed,\nand gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the\nnotion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and\nthe opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed\nand went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for\nfour-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last\nself-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept\nsoundly.\nWednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking\nlights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a\nmarsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was\nspanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there\nat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the\nclustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the\nunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn\nfrom the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.\nFrom me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.\nHerbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on\nthe sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the\nfire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In\ngood time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the\nsharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still\nflowing towards us.",

Of course, I had\ntaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After\na little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two\nor three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went\non board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then\nabout high-water,\u2014half-past eight.\nOur plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being\nwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,\nand row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long\nreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is\nbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and\nwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we\ncould choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all\nnight. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would\nstart from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at\nwhat time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail\nthe first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we\nshould have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each\nvessel.\nThe relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was\nso great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in\nwhich I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the\nmovement on the river, and the moving river itself,\u2014the road that ran\nwith us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us\non,\u2014freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use\nin the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,\nand they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.\nAt that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present",

I had seen none. We\ncertainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not\neither attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by\nany boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on,\nor to make her purpose evident. But we held our own without any\nappearance of molestation.\nHe had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural\npart of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he\nhad led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us.\nHe was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his\ngentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not\ndisposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no\nnotion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted\nit, but it must come before he troubled himself.\n\"If you knowed, dear boy,\" he said to me, \"what it is to sit here\nalonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day\nbetwixt four walls, you'd envy me. But you don't know what it is.\"\n\"I think I know the delights of freedom,\" I answered.\n\"Ah,\" said he, shaking his head gravely. \"But you don't know it equal\nto me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it\nequal to me,\u2014but I ain't a-going to be low.\"\nIt occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he\nshould have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected\nthat perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the\nhabit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I\nwas not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:\u2014\n\"You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t'other side the world, I\nwas always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for\nall I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could\ncome, and Magwitch could go, and nobody's head would be troubled about\nhim. They ain't so easy concerning me here, dear boy,\u2014wouldn't be,\nleastwise, if they knowed where I was.\"\n\"If all goes well,\" said I, \"you will be perfectly free and safe again\nwithin a few hours.\"\n\"Well,\" he returned, drawing a long breath, \"I hope so.\"\n\"And think so?\"\nHe dipped his hand in the water over the boat's gunwale, and said,\nsmiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:\u2014\n\"Ay, I s'pose I think so, dear boy. We'd be puzzled to be more quiet\nand easy-going than we are at present. But\u2014it's a flowing so soft and\npleasant through the water, p'raps, as makes me think it\u2014I was a\nthinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the\nbottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this\nriver what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can't no more hold their tide\nthan I can hold this. And it's run through my fingers and gone, you\nsee!\" holding up his dripping hand.\n\"But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,\" said\nI.\n\"Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of\nthat there rippling at the boat's head making a sort of a Sunday tune.\nMaybe I'm a growing a trifle old besides.\"\nHe put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of\nface, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of\nEngland. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been\nin constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer\ninto the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he\nwould be safest where he was, and he said. \"Do you, dear boy?\" and\nquietly sat down again.\nThe air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the\nsunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose\nnone of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By\nimperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of\nthe nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the\nmuddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.",

We had all shaken hands\ncordially, and neither Herbert's eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I\nsaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\nahead of us, and row out into the same track.\nA stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer's smoke,\nby reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,\ncoming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the\ntide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to\nsit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, \"Trust to\nme, dear boy,\" and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was\nvery skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and\nfallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,\nshe kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or\ntwo when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and\nlooked at us attentively,\u2014as did all the rowers; the other sitter was\nwrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some\ninstruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in\neither boat.\nStartop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\nand gave me the word \"Hamburg,\" in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\nShe was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew\nlouder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,\nwhen the galley hailed us. I answered.\n\"You have a returned Transport there,\" said the man who held the lines.\n\"That's the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\notherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\nand you to assist.\"\nAt the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\nhe ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke\nahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on\nto our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\nconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\nheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but\nfelt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw\nthe steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner's shoulder,\nand saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,\nand saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\nfrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,\nlean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\nshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that\nthe face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.\nStill, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white\nterror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board\nthe steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink\nfrom under me.\nIt was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\nmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\ntaken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;\nbut our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.",

The injury to\nhis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought\nhe had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did\nnot pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,\nbut that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify\nhim, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had\nboth gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him\n(Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him\nin it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down\nfiercely locked in each other's arms, and that there had been a\nstruggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,\nand swum away.\nI never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told\nme. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their\ngoing overboard.\nWhen I asked this officer's permission to change the prisoner's wet\nclothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the\npublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take\ncharge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book\nwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer's. He further\ngave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to\naccord that grace to my two friends.\nThe Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\ndown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\nlikeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to\nbe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\nvarious stages of decay.\nWe remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then\nMagwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and\nStartop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a\ndoleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch's side, I felt\nthat that was my place henceforth while he lived.",

Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had\nmeant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened\nthat there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could\ngive the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his\nprivate house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and\nMr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing. It was the\nsole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five\nminutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could\nprevent its going against us.\nI imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\nfate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\nhaving \"let it slip through my fingers,\" and said we must memorialise\nby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal\nfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which the\nforfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this\ncase to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not\nrelated to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;\nhe had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his\napprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I\nfinally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my\nheart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to\nestablish one.\nThere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had\nhoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some\naccurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs. When his body was found, many\nmiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he\nwas only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still\nlegible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a\nbanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\ninformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\nJaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His\nignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but\nthat my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.\nAfter three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over\nfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness\ncame, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial\nat the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.",

I had not seen him\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had\ncome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of\nexplanation in reference to that failure.\n\"The late Compeyson,\" said Wemmick, \"had by little and little got at\nthe bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was\nfrom the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people\nbeing always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,\nseeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I\nthought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only\nsuppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,\nhabitually to deceive his own instruments. You don't blame me, I hope,\nMr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.\"\n\"I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most\nearnestly for all your interest and friendship.\"\n\"Thank you, thank you very much. It's a bad job,\" said Wemmick,\nscratching his head, \"and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a\nlong time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable\nproperty. Dear me!\"\n\"What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.\"\n\"Yes, to be sure,\" said Wemmick. \"Of course, there can be no objection\nto your being sorry for him, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself\nto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and\nbeing so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have\nbeen saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been\nsaved. That's the difference between the property and the owner, don't\nyou see?\"\nI invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of\ngrog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\nwas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up\nto it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,\u2014\n\"What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?\"\n\"Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.\"\n\"These twelve years, more likely,\" said Wemmick. \"Yes. I'm going to\ntake a holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk. More than\nthat; I'm going to ask you to take a walk with me.\"\nI was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,\nwhen Wemmick anticipated me.\n\"I know your engagements,\" said he, \"and I know you are out of sorts,\nMr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\nIt ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy you\n(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn't you\nstretch a point and manage it?\"\nHe had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\nto do for him. I said I could manage it,\u2014would manage it,\u2014and he was so\nvery much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\nparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\npast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.",

            "text": "Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday\nmorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking\ntighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two\nglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have\nbeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his\nbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\nWhen we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and\nwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was\nconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it\nover his shoulder. \"Why, we are not going fishing!\" said I. \"No,\"\nreturned Wemmick, \"but I like to walk with one.\"\nI thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went\ntowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said\nsuddenly,\u2014\n\"Halloa! Here's a church!\"\nThere was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\nsurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,\u2014\n\"Let's go in!\"\nWe went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked\nall round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,\nand getting something out of paper there.\n\"Halloa!\" said he. \"Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 'em\non!\"\nAs the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\nto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\nwere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\ndoor, escorting a lady.\n\"Halloa!\" said Wemmick. \"Here's Miss Skiffins! Let's have a wedding.\"\nThat discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\nAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the\naltar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to\nput him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\npillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\ngentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\nresistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\nperfection.\nThe clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\nthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\npreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out\nof his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, \"Halloa! Here's a\nring!\"\nI acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;\nwhile a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a\nfeint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of\ngiving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the\nclergyman's being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.\nWhen he said, \"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?\" the\nold gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we\nhad arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.\nUpon which, the clergyman said again, \"WHO giveth this woman to be\nmarried to this man?\" The old gentleman being still in a state of most\nestimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed\nvoice, \"Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?\" To which the Aged replied\nwith great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, \"All right, John,\nall right, my boy!\" And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon\nit, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely\nmarried that day.\nIt was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\nWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,\nand put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,\nput her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. \"_Now_, Mr.\nPip,\" said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\nout, \"let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\nwedding-party!\"\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\nboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\nthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\nunwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in\na high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,\nand submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have\ndone.\nWe had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\ntable, Wemmick said, \"Provided by contract, you know; don't be afraid\nof it!\" I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the\nCastle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I\ncould.\nWemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with\nhim, and wished him joy.\n\"Thankee!\" said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. \"She's such a manager of\nfowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\nyourself. I say, Mr. Pip!\" calling me back, and speaking low. \"This is\naltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.\"\n\"I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,\" said I.\nWemmick nodded. \"After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may\nas well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or\nsomething of the kind.\"",

He had broken\ntwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great\npain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\nvery little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the\nfirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he\nought to hear.\nBeing far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after\nthe first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of\nbeing with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for his\nillness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\ndetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\nAlthough I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\ndo not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\nwasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\nwhen the prison door closed upon him.\nThe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\nwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\ncircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\nway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\nIt happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his\ndesperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in\nattendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his\neyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had\nseen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was\na little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I\nnever knew him complain.",

But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds\nbefore me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that\nI saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\nsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him.\nThe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,\ndown to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering\nin the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside\nit at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and\nwomen; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\nweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\nstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\nand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\ngallery full of people,\u2014a large theatrical audience,\u2014looked on, as the\ntwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\naddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\nbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments\nand punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of\nyears; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had\nmade his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable\nman would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when\nfar removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a\npeaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those\npropensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered\nhim a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and\nrepentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.\nBeing here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading\nthe officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of\nflight, he had resisted them, and had\u2014he best knew whether by express\ndesign, or in the blindness of his hardihood\u2014caused the death of his\ndenouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment\nfor his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his\ncase being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\nThe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\nlight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\nwith absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all\nthings, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face\nin this way of light, the prisoner said, \"My Lord, I have received my\nsentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,\" and sat down\nagain. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had\nto say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of\nthem were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard\nlook of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three\nshook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had\ntaken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of\nhaving to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held\nmy hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got\nup (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),\nand pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him\nand me.",

Nobody was hard with him or with me. There\nwas duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer\nalways gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick\nprisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as\nsick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be\nthanked!) always joined in the same report.\nAs the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\nlooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\nsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\nunderstand his meaning very well.\nThe number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in\nhim than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and\nlighted up as I entered.\n\"Dear boy,\" he said, as I sat down by his bed: \"I thought you was late.\nBut I knowed you couldn't be that.\"\n\"It is just the time,\" said I. \"I waited for it at the gate.\"\n\"You always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?\"\n\"Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.\"\n\"Thank'ee dear boy, thank'ee. God bless you! You've never deserted me,\ndear boy.\"\nI pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once\nmeant to desert him.\n\"And what's the best of all,\" he said, \"you've been more comfortable\nalonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.\nThat's best of all.\"\nHe lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,\nand love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and\na film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.\n\"Are you in much pain to-day?\"\n\"I don't complain of none, dear boy.\"\n\"You never do complain.\"\nHe had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to\nmean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid\nit there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.\nThe allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,\n\"You needn't go yet.\" I thanked him gratefully, and asked, \"Might I\nspeak to him, if he can hear me?\"\nThe governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\nthough it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid\nlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.\n\"Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I\nsay?\"\nA gentle pressure on my hand.\n\"You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.\"\nA stronger pressure on my hand.\n\"She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a\nlady and very beautiful. And I love her!\"\nWith a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my\nyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying\non it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,\nand his head dropped quietly on his breast.\nMindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men\nwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better\nwords that I could say beside his bed, than \"O Lord, be merciful to him",

Which she would have tapped yourn next,\nand draw'd it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away\nthe coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the\nwine and spirits in your Wellington boots.\"\nWe looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had\nonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day\ncame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,\ntook me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were\nstill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\nthe wealth of his great nature.\nAnd Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,\nwhere the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,\nand sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be\nSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how\nit had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been\nforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and\nby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning\nand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\nthere came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday\nbells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I\nfelt that I was not nearly thankful enough,\u2014that I was too weak yet to\nbe even that,\u2014and I laid my head on Joe's shoulder, as I had laid it\nlong ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too\nmuch for my young senses.\nMore composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to\ntalk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change\nwhatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my\neyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.\nWhen we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me\u2014so\neasily!\u2014across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful\nChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet\nmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of\nmy late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself\nnow, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself\nwhether I ought to refer to it when he did not.\n\"Have you heard, Joe,\" I asked him that evening, upon further\nconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, \"who my patron\nwas?\"\n\"I heerd,\" returned Joe, \"as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.\"\n\"Did you hear who it was, Joe?\"\n\"Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv' you\nthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.\"\n\"So it was.\"\n\"Astonishing!\" said Joe, in the placidest way.\n\"Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?\" I presently asked, with\nincreasing diffidence.\n\"Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I think,\" said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather\nevasively at the window-seat, \"as I _did_ hear tell that how he were\nsomething or another in a general way in that direction.\"\n\"Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?\"\n\"Not partickler, Pip.\"\n\"If you would like to hear, Joe\u2014\" I was beginning, when Joe got up and\ncame to my sofa.\n\"Lookee here, old chap,\" said Joe, bending over me. \"Ever the best of\nfriends; ain't us, Pip?\"\nI was ashamed to answer him.\n\"Wery good, then,\" said Joe, as if I _had_ answered; \"that's all right;\nthat's agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as\nbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There's subjects enough\nas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your\npoor sister and her Rampages! And don't you remember Tickler?\"\n\"I do indeed, Joe.\"\n\"Lookee here, old chap,\" said Joe. \"I done what I could to keep you and\nTickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my\ninclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it\nwere not so much,\" said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, \"that\nshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that\nshe dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain't a\ngrab at a man's whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your\nsister was quite welcome), that 'ud put a man off from getting a little\nchild out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into\nheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up\nand says to himself, 'Where is the good as you are a-doing? I grant you\nI see the 'arm,' says the man, 'but I don't see the good. I call upon\nyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.'\"\n\"The man says?\" I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\n\"The man says,\" Joe assented. \"Is he right, that man?\"\n\"Dear Joe, he is always right.\"\n\"Well, old chap,\" said Joe, \"then abide by your words. If he's always\nright (which in general he's more likely wrong), he's right when he\nsays this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when\nyou was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know'd as J.\nGargery's power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal\nto his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two\nsech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy\ngiv' herself a deal o' trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost\nawful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this\nlight, as I should so put it. Both of which,\" said Joe, quite charmed\nwith his logical arrangement, \"being done, now this to you a true\nfriend, say. Namely. You mustn't go a overdoing on it, but you must\nhave your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt\nthe sheets.\"\nThe delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact\nand kindness with which Biddy\u2014who with her woman's wit had found me out\nso soon\u2014had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\nwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all\ndissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\nunderstand.\nAnother thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\ndevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\nof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\neasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\nfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\nthe dear \"old Pip, old chap,\" that now were music in my ears. I too had\nfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\nimperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe's hold upon them began\nto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\nall mine.\nAh! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\nin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\nJoe's innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\nstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\nloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?",

Now, you shall see me walk back\nby myself.\"\n\"Which do not overdo it, Pip,\" said Joe; \"but I shall be happy fur to\nsee you able, sir.\"\nThe last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\nfurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker\nthan I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\nthoughtful.\nI, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\nchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\ndown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\nquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\nsavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\nmust not suffer him to do it.\nIt was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\nbed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,\u2014to-morrow being\nSunday,\u2014and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\nmorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\nlast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\n(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\nout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\ncleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\narrived at a resolution too.\nWe had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\nthen walked in the fields.\n\"I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,\" I said.\n\"Dear old Pip, old chap, you're a'most come round, sir.\"\n\"It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.\"\n\"Likeways for myself, sir,\" Joe returned.\n\"We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\ndays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\nforget these.\"\n\"Pip,\" said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, \"there has\nbeen larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us\u2014have been.\"\nAt night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done\nall through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well\nas in the morning?\n\"Yes, dear Joe, quite.\"\n\"And are always a getting stronger, old chap?\"\n\"Yes, dear Joe, steadily.\"\nJoe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and\nsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, \"Good night!\"\nWhen I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of\nmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before\nbreakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;\nfor, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and\nhe was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.\nI hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These\nwere its brief contents:\u2014\n\"Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear\nPip and will do better without\nJO.\n\"P.S. Ever the best of friends.\"\nEnclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I\nhad been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my\ncreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be\nquite recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe's having paid the money;\nbut Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.",

Mr. Pumblechook (not improved\nin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and\naddressed me in the following terms:\u2014\n\"Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be\nexpected! what else could be expected!\"\nAs he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I\nwas broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.\n\"William,\" said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, \"put a muffin on table.\nAnd has it come to this! Has it come to this!\"\nI frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me\nand poured out my tea\u2014before I could touch the teapot\u2014with the air of a\nbenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.\n\"William,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, \"put the salt on. In\nhappier times,\" addressing me, \"I think you took sugar? And did you\ntake milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said I, shortly, \"but I don't eat watercresses.\"\n\"You don't eat 'em,\" returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his\nhead several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if\nabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. \"True.\nThe simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn't bring any, William.\"\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand\nover me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\n\"Little more than skin and bone!\" mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. \"And\nyet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread\nafore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!\"\nThis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, \"May I?\"\nand the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\nsame fat five fingers.\n\"Hah!\" he went on, handing me the bread and butter. \"And air you\na-going to Joseph?\"\n\"In heaven's name,\" said I, firing in spite of myself, \"what does it\nmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.\"\nIt was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\nthe opportunity he wanted.\n\"Yes, young man,\" said he, releasing the handle of the article in\nquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, \"I _will_ leave that\nteapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I\nforgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to\nwish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of\nprodigygality, to be stimilated by the 'olesome nourishment of your\nforefathers. And yet,\" said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and\nwaiter, and pointing me out at arm's length, \"this is him as I ever\nsported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I\ntell you this is him!\"\nA low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\nparticularly affected.\n\"This is him,\" said Pumblechook, \"as I have rode in my shay-cart. This\nis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\nof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M'ria from\nher own mother, let him deny it if he can!\"\nThe waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\nthe case a black look.\n\"Young man,\" said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\nfashion, \"you air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask\nme, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to\nJoseph.\"\nThe waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\n\"Now,\" said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of\nsaying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\nconclusive, \"I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\nthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is\nWilliam, which his father's name was Potkins if I do not deceive\nmyself.\"\n\"You do not, sir,\" said William.\n\"In their presence,\" pursued Pumblechook, \"I will tell you, young man,\nwhat to say to Joseph. Says you, \"Joseph, I have this day seen my\nearliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun's. I will name no\nnames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\nseen that man.\"\n\"I swear I don't see him here,\" said I.\n\"Say that likewise,\" retorted Pumblechook. \"Say you said that, and even\nJoseph will probably betray surprise.\"\n\"There you quite mistake him,\" said I. \"I know better.\"\n\"Says you,\" Pumblechook went on, \"'Joseph, I have seen that man, and\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\ncharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\nignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\ngratitoode. Yes, Joseph,' says you,\" here Pumblechook shook his head\nand hand at me, \"'he knows my total deficiency of common human\ngratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,\nJoseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.'\"\nWindy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\nto talk thus to mine.\n\"Says you, 'Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\nrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\nProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\nplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode to\nhis earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's_. But that man said he\ndid not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to\ndo it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would\ndo it again.'\"\n\"It's pity,\" said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted\nbreakfast, \"that the man did not say what he had done and would do\nagain.\"\n\"Squires of the Boar!\" Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,\n\"and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town\nor down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do\nit, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.\"\nWith those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\nand left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by",

I went towards them slowly, for\nmy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew\nnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness\nfurther and further behind.\nThe June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were\nsoaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more\nbeautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many\npleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the\nchange for the better that would come over my character when I had a\nguiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I\nhad proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for\nmy heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass,\nthat I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,\nand whose wanderings had lasted many years.\nThe schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the\nlittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness'\nsake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a\nholiday; no children were there, and Biddy's house was closed. Some\nhopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties,\nbefore she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.\nBut the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it\nunder the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer.\nLong after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I\nheard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there,\nand the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and\ntheir leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the\nclink of Joe's hammer was not in the midsummer wind.\nAlmost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I\nsaw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no\nglittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and\nstill.\nBut the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to be in\nuse, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the\nwindow was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning\nto peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in\narm.\nAt first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but\nin another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she\nwept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she,\nbecause I looked so worn and white.\n\"But dear Biddy, how smart you are!\"\n\"Yes, dear Pip.\"\n\"And Joe, how smart _you_ are!\"\n\"Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.\"\nI looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then\u2014\n\"It's my wedding-day!\" cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, \"and I am\nmarried to Joe!\"\nThey had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the\nold deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe's\nrestoring touch was on my shoulder. \"Which he warn't strong enough, my\ndear, fur to be surprised,\" said Joe. And Biddy said, \"I ought to have\nthought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.\" They were both so\noverjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to\nthem, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their\nday complete!\nMy first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never\nbreathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me\nin my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been\nhis knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!\n\"Dear Biddy,\" said I, \"you have the best husband in the whole world,\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would have\u2014But no, you\ncouldn't love him better than you do.\"\n\"No, I couldn't indeed,\" said Biddy.\n\"And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble\nJoe!\"\nJoe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before\nhis eyes.\n\"And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in\ncharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you\nhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I\nam going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I\nshall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have\nkept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don't think, dear Joe\nand Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I\ncould cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if\nI could!\"\nThey were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no\nmore.\n\"But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter\nnight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\never. Don't tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell him, Biddy,\nthat I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured you\nboth, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child,\nI said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I\ndid.\"\n\"I ain't a-going,\" said Joe, from behind his sleeve, \"to tell him\nnothink o' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't.\"\n\"And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind\nhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you\nsay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and\nthen I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better\nof me, in the time to come!\"\n\"O dear old Pip, old chap,\" said Joe. \"God knows as I forgive you, if I\nhave anythink to forgive!\"\n\"Amen! And God knows I do!\" echoed Biddy.\n\"Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few\nminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go\nwith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say\ngood-bye!\"",

It is the only possession I have not\nrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I\nhave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I\nmade in all the wretched years.\"\n\"Is it to be built on?\"\n\"At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And\nyou,\" she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,\u2014\"you\nlive abroad still?\"\n\"Still.\"\n\"And do well, I am sure?\"\n\"I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore\u2014yes, I do\nwell.\"\n\"I have often thought of you,\" said Estella.\n\"Have you?\"\n\"Of late, very often.
