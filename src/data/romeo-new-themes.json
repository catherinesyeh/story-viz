But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\nSamp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.\nGreg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.\nTherefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.\nSamp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take\nthe\nwall of any man or maid of Montague's.\nGreg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the\nwall.\nSamp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\nare\never thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men\nfrom the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.\nGreg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\nSamp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have\nfought\nwith the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off\ntheir heads.\nGreg. The heads of the maids?\nSamp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\nTake it in what sense thou wilt.\nGreg. They must take it in sense that feel it.\nSamp.

The all-seeing sun\nNe'er saw her match since first the world begun.\nBen. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,\nHerself pois'd with herself in either eye;\nBut in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd\nYour lady's love against some other maid\nThat I will show you shining at this feast,\nAnd she shall scant show well that now seems best.\nRom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,\nBut to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.]",

What, lamb! what ladybird!\nGod forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!\nEnter Juliet.\nJul. How now? Who calls?\nNurse. Your mother.\nJul. Madam, I am here.\nWhat is your will?\nWife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,\nWe must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;\nI have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.\nThou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.\nNurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\nWife. She's not fourteen.\nNurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-\nAnd yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-\nShe is not fourteen. How long is it now\nTo Lammastide?\nWife. A fortnight and odd days.\nNurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,\nCome Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\nSusan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\nWere of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\nShe was too good for me. But, as I said,\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\nThat shall she, marry; I remember it well.\n'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\nAnd she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day;\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua.\nNay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\nTo see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\nShake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,\nTo bid me trudge.\nAnd since that time it is eleven years,\nFor then she could stand alone; nay, by th' rood,\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\nFor even the day before, she broke her brow;\nAnd then my husband (God be with his soul!\n'A was a merry man) took up the child.\n'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\nWilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,\nThe pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'\nTo see now how a jest shall come about!\nI warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,\nI never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,\nAnd, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'\nWife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.\nNurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh\nTo think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'\nAnd yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow\nA bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;\nA perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.\n'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\nWilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'\nJul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\nNurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\nThou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.\nAn I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\nWife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme\nI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\nHow stands your disposition to be married?\nJul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\nNurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,\nI would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.\nWife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\nAre made already mothers. By my count,\nI was your mother much upon these years\nThat you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\nNurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man\nAs all the world- why he's a man of wax.\nWife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.\nNurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.\nWife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\nThis night you shall behold him at our feast.\nRead o'er the volume of young Paris' face,\nAnd find delight writ there with beauty's pen;\nExamine every married lineament,\nAnd see how one another lends content;\nAnd what obscur'd in this fair volume lies\nFind written in the margent of his eyes,\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover,\nTo beautify him only lacks a cover.\nThe fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride\nFor fair without the fair within to hide.\nThat book in many's eyes doth share the glory,\nThat in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess,\nBy having him making yourself no less.\nNurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men\nWife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?\nJul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.\nEnter Servingman.\nServ. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,\nmy\nyoung lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and\neverything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you\nfollow straight.\nWife. We follow thee. Exit [Servingman].\nJuliet, the County stays.\nNurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\nExeunt.\nScene IV.\nA street.\nEnter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;\nTorchbearers.\nRom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\nOr shall we on without apology?\nBen. The date is out of such prolixity.\nWe'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,\nBearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,\nScaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;\nNor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\nAfter the prompter, for our entrance;\nBut, let them measure us by what they will,\nWe'll measure them a measure, and be gone.\nRom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.\nBeing but heavy, I will bear the light.\nMer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\nRom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\nWith nimble soles; I have a soul of lead\nSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\nMer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings\nAnd soar with them above a common bound.\nRom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft\nTo soar with his light feathers; and so bound\nI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\nUnder love's heavy burthen do I sink.\nMer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-\nToo great oppression for a tender thing.\nRom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,\nToo rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\nMer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.\nPrick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\nGive me a case to put my visage in.\nA visor for a visor! What care I\nWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?\nHere are the beetle brows shall blush for me.\nBen. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in\nBut every man betake him to his legs.\nRom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\nFor I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,\nI'll be a candle-holder and look on;\nThe game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.\nMer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!\nIf thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire\nOf this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st\nUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\nRom. Nay, that's not so.\nMer. I mean, sir, in delay\nWe waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\nTake our good meaning, for our judgment sits\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits.\nRom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;\nBut 'tis no wit to go.\nMer. Why, may one ask?\nRom. I dreamt a dream to-night.\nMer. And so did I.\nRom. Well, what was yours?\nMer. That dreamers often lie.\nRom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\nMer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\nIn shape no bigger than an agate stone\nOn the forefinger of an alderman,\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\nAthwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\nHer wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,\nThe cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\nHer traces, of the smallest spider's web;\nHer collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;\nHer whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;\nHer wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\nNot half so big as a round little worm\nPrick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut,\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\nTime out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\nThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\nO'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;\nO'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\nO'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\nSometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\nTickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,\nThen dreams he of another benefice.\nSometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\nOf healths five fadom deep; and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\nAnd being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night\nAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,\nWhich once untangled much misfortune bodes\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\nThat presses them and learns them first to bear,\nMaking them women of good carriage.\nThis is she-\nRom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\nThou talk'st of nothing.\nMer. True, I talk of dreams;\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy;\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\nEven now the frozen bosom of the North\nAnd, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,\nTurning his face to the dew-dropping South.\nBen. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\nRom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives\nSome consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\nWith this night's revels and expire the term\nOf a despised life, clos'd in my breast,\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\nBut he that hath the steerage of my course\nDirect my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!\nBen. Strike, drum.\nThey march about the stage. [Exeunt.]\nScene V.\nCapulet's house.\nServingmen come forth with napkins.\n1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?\nHe shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!\n2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's\nhands,\nand they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.\n1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,\nlook\nto the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as\nthou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and\nNell.\nAnthony, and Potpan!\n2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.\n1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and\nsought\nfor, in the great chamber.\n3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!\nBe brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. Exeunt.\nEnter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,\nJuliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests\nand Gentlewomen to the Maskers.\nCap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes\nUnplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.\nAh ha, my mistresses! which of you all\nWill now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,\nShe I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?\nWelcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\nThat I have worn a visor and could tell\nA whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,\nSuch as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!\nYou are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.\nA hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.\nMusic plays, and they dance.\nMore light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,\nAnd quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.\nAh, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.\nNay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,\nFor you and I are past our dancing days.\nHow long is't now since last yourself and I\nWere in a mask?\n2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.\nCap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!\n'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,\nCome Pentecost as quickly as it will,\nSome five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.\n2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;\nHis son is thirty.\nCap. Will you tell me that?\nHis son was but a ward two years ago.\nRom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the\nhand\nOf yonder knight?\nServ. I know not, sir.\nRom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\nIt seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\nLike a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-\nBeauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\nSo shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\nAs yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.\nThe measure done, I'll watch her place of stand\nAnd, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\nDid my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!\nFor I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.\nTyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.\nFetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave\nCome hither, cover'd with an antic face,\nTo fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\nNow, by the stock and honour of my kin,\nTo strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\nCap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?\nTyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;\nA villain, that is hither come in spite\nTo scorn at our solemnity this night.\nCap. Young Romeo is it?\nTyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.\nCap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.\n'A bears him like a portly gentleman,\nAnd, to say truth, Verona brags of him\nTo be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.\nI would not for the wealth of all this town\nHere in my house do him disparagement.\nTherefore be patient, take no note of him.\nIt is my will; the which if thou respect,\nShow a fair presence and put off these frowns,\nAn ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\nTyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.\nI'll not endure him.\nCap. He shall be endur'd.\nWhat, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!\nAm I the master here, or you? Go to!\nYou'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!\nYou'll make a mutiny among my guests!\nYou will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!\nTyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.\nCap. Go to, go to!\nYou are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?\nThis trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.\nYou must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-\nWell said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!\nBe quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!\nI'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!\nTyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting\nMakes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\nI will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,\nNow seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall. Exit.\nRom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand\nThis holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:\nMy lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\nTo smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\nJul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\nWhich mannerly devotion shows in this;\nFor saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\nRom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\nJul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.\nRom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!\nThey pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\nJul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.\nRom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.\nThus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd. [Kisses her.]\nJul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.\nRom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!\nGive me my sin again. [Kisses her.]\nJul. You kiss by th' book.\nNurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.\nRom. What is her mother?\nNurse. Marry, bachelor,\nHer mother is the lady of the house.\nAnd a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.\nI nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.\nI tell you, he that can lay hold of her\nShall have the chinks.\nRom. Is she a Capulet?\nO dear account! my life is my foe's debt.\nBen. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.\nRom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.\nCap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;\nWe have a trifling foolish banquet towards.\nIs it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.\nI thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.\nMore torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to\nbed.\nAh, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;\nI'll to my rest.\nExeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].\nJul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?\nNurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.\nJul. What's he that now is going out of door?\nNurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.\nJul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?\nNurse. I know not.\nJul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,\nMy grave is like to be my wedding bed.\nNurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,\nThe only son of your great enemy.\nJul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!\nToo early seen unknown, and known too late!\nProdigious birth of love it is to me\nThat I must love a loathed enemy.\nNurse. What's this? what's this?\nJul. A rhyme I learnt even now\nOf one I danc'd withal.\nOne calls within, 'Juliet.'\nNurse. Anon, anon!\nCome, let's away; the strangers all are gone. Exeunt.",

      "text": "Scene II.\nCapulet's orchard.\nEnter Romeo.\nRom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.\nEnter Juliet above at a window.\nBut soft! What light through yonder window breaks?\nIt is the East, and Juliet is the sun!\nArise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\nWho is already sick and pale with grief\nThat thou her maid art far more fair than she.\nBe not her maid, since she is envious.\nHer vestal livery is but sick and green,\nAnd none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.\nIt is my lady; O, it is my love!\nO that she knew she were!\nShe speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\nHer eye discourses; I will answer it.\nI am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\nWhat if her eyes were there, they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\nO that I were a glove upon that hand,\nThat I might touch that cheek!\nJul. Ah me!\nRom. She speaks.\nO, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\nAs glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\nAs is a winged messenger of heaven\nUnto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes\nOf mortals that fall back to gaze on him\nWhen he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds\nAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.\nJul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name!\nOr, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I'll no longer be a Capulet.\nRom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\nJul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\nWhat's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\nBelonging to a man. O, be some other name!\nWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose\nBy any other name would smell as sweet.\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name;\nAnd for that name, which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself.\nRom. I take thee at thy word.\nCall me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\nJul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\nRom. By a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am.\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\nBecause it is an enemy to thee.\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\nJul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\nOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.\nArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\nRom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\nJul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\nRom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\nAnd what love can do, that dares love attempt.\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\nJul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.\nRom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye\nThan twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,\nAnd I am proof against their enmity.\nJul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.\nRom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here.\nMy life were better ended by their hate\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\nJul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?\nRom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\nI am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\nAs that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,\nI would adventure for such merchandise.\nJul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.\nFain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny\nWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment!\nDost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,\nThey say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\nOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\nI'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;\nBut trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,\nMy true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\nRom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-\nJul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\nRom. What shall I swear by?\nJul. Do not swear at all;\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I'll believe thee.\nRom. If my heart's dear love-\nJul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract to-night.\nIt is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!\nThis bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\nMay prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.\nGood night, good night! As sweet repose and rest\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast!\nRom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\nJul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\nRom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.\nJul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\nRom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\nJul. But to be frank and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have.\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\nI hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!\n[Nurse] calls within.\nAnon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\nStay but a little, I will come again. [Exit.]\nRom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,\nToo flattering-sweet to be substantial.\nEnter Juliet above.\nJul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\nThy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\nBy one that I'll procure to come to thee,\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\nNurse. (within) Madam!\nJul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,\nI do beseech thee-\nNurse. (within) Madam!\nJul. By-and-by I come.-\nTo cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.\nTo-morrow will I send.\nRom. So thrive my soul-\nJul. A thousand times good night! Exit.\nRom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!\nLove goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;\nBut love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\nEnter Juliet again, [above].\nJul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again!\nBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\nWith repetition of my Romeo's name.\nRomeo!\nRom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,\nLike softest music to attending ears!\nJul. Romeo!\nRom. My dear?\nJul. At what o'clock to-morrow\nShall I send to thee?\nRom. By the hour of nine.\nJul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\nRom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.\nJul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\nRememb'ring how I love thy company.\nRom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,\nForgetting any other home but this.\nJul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton's bird,\nThat lets it hop a little from her hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\nRom. I would I were thy bird.\nJul. Sweet, so would I.\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\nGood night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\n[Exit.]\nRom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!\nHence will I to my ghostly father's cell,\nHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\nExit\nScene III.",

That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?\nRom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,\nWhere on a sudden one hath wounded me\nThat's by me wounded. Both our remedies\nWithin thy help and holy physic lies.\nI bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,\nMy intercession likewise steads my foe.\nFriar.

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet;\nAs mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,\nAnd all combin'd, save what thou must combine\nBy holy marriage. When, and where, and how\nWe met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,\nI'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\nThat thou consent to marry us to-day.\nFriar. Holy Saint Francis!

Pronounce this sentence then:\nWomen may fall when there's no strength in men.\nRom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.\nFriar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\nRom. And bad'st me bury love.\nFriar. Not in a grave\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\nRom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\nThe other did not so.\nFriar. O, she knew well\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\nBut come, young waverer, come go with me.\nIn one respect I'll thy assistant be;\nFor this alliance may so happy prove\nTo turn your households' rancour to pure love.\nRom.

A challenge, on my life.\nBen. Romeo will answer it.\nMer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.\nBen. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,\nbeing\ndared.\nMer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white\nwench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the\nvery pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's\nbutt-shaft;\nand is he a man to encounter Tybalt?\nBen.

He fights as you sing\npricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his\nminim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very\nbutcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman\nof\nthe very first house, of the first and second cause.

The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\nRom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such\na\ncase as mine a man may strain courtesy.\nMer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains\na\nman to bow in the hams.\nRom. Meaning, to cursy.\nMer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.\nRom. A most courteous exposition.\nMer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\nRom. Pink for flower.\nMer. Right.\nRom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.\nMer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out\nthy\npump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may\nremain, after the wearing, solely singular.\nRom.

Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for\nthou\nhast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am\nsure, I\nhave in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\nRom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not\nthere\nfor the goose.\nMer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\nRom. Nay, good goose, bite not!\nMer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp\nsauce.\nRom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?\nMer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch\nnarrow to an ell broad!\nRom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to\nthe\ngoose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\nMer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?

An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an\n'a\nwere lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I\ncannot,\nI'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his\nflirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must\nstand\nby too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!\nPeter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my\nweapon\nshould quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as\nsoon\nas another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the\nlaw\non my side.\nNurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me\nquivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told\nyou,\nmy young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I\nwill\nkeep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead\nher\ninto a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross\nkind of\nbehaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and\ntherefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were\nan\nill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak\ndealing.\nRom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\nthee-\nNurse. Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much. Lord,\nLord! she will be a joyful woman.\nRom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\nNurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I\ntake\nit, is a gentlemanlike offer.\nRom. Bid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon;\nAnd there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell\nBe shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.\nNurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.\nRom. Go to! I say you shall.\nNurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\nRom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.\nFarewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\nNurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\nRom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?\nNurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\nRom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.\nNurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!\nwhen 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in\ntown, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,\ngood\nsoul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I\nanger\nher sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;\nbut\nI'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\nclout\nin the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both\nwith\na letter?\nRom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\nNurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I\nknow\nit begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest\nsententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you\ngood\nto hear it.\nRom. Commend me to thy lady.\nNurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!\nPeter. Anon.\nNurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.\nExeunt.",

Good, good nurse, speak.\nNurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?\nDo you not see that I am out of breath?\nJul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that.\nSay either, and I'll stay the circumstance.\nLet me be satisfied, is't good or bad?\nNurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to\nchoose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better\nthan\nany man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a\nfoot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet\nthey\nare past compare.

I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\nSweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?\nNurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a\ncourteous,\nand a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where\nis\nyour mother?\nJul. Where is my mother?

Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?\nBen. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.\nRomeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal\nYour high displeasure. All this- uttered\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\nOf Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\nCold death aside and with the other sends\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\n'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\nAnd 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;\nBut by-and-by comes back to Romeo,\nWho had but newly entertain'd revenge,\nAnd to't they go like lightning; for, ere I\nCould draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;\nAnd, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\nCap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.\nRomeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.\nPrince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\nMon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\nThe life of Tybalt.\nPrince. And for that offence\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\nI have an interest in your hate's proceeding,\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;\nBut I'll amerce you with so strong a fine\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\nTherefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\nBear hence this body, and attend our will.\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\nExeunt.",

Such a wagoner\nAs Phaeton would whip you to the West\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.\nSpread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\nThat runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo\nLeap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.\nLovers can see to do their amorous rites\nBy their own beauties; or, if love be blind,\nIt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,\nThou sober-suited matron, all in black,\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match,\nPlay'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\nHood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,\nWith thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,\nThink true love acted simple modesty.\nCome, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\nWhiter than new snow upon a raven's back.\nCome, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;\nGive me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\nAnd he will make the face of heaven so fine\nThat all the world will be in love with night\nAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.\nO, I have bought the mansion of a love,\nBut not possess'd it; and though I am sold,\nNot yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day\nAs is the night before some festival\nTo an impatient child that hath new robes\nAnd may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,\nEnter Nurse, with cords.\nAnd she brings news; and every tongue that speaks\nBut Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.\nNow, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords\nThat Romeo bid thee fetch?\nNurse. Ay, ay, the cords.\n[Throws them down.]\nJul. Ah me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?\nNurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!\nWe are undone, lady, we are undone!\nAlack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!\nJul. Can heaven be so envious?\nNurse. Romeo can,\nThough heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!\nWho ever would have thought it? Romeo!\nJul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?\nThis torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.\nHath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'\nAnd that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more\nThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.\nI am not I, if there be such an 'I';\nOr those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'\nIf he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'\nBrief sounds determine of my weal or woe.\nNurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\n(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.\nA piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,\nAll in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.\nJul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!\nTo prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!\nVile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,\nAnd thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!\nNurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!\nO courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman\nThat ever I should live to see thee dead!\nJul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?\nIs Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?\nMy dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?\nThen, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!\nFor who is living, if those two are gone?\nNurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;\nRomeo that kill'd him, he is banished.\nJul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?\nNurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!\nJul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!\nDid ever dragon keep so fair a cave?\nBeautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!\nDove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!\nDespised substance of divinest show!\nJust opposite to what thou justly seem'st-\nA damned saint, an honourable villain!\nO nature, what hadst thou to do in hell\nWhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend\nIn mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?\nWas ever book containing such vile matter\nSo fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell\nIn such a gorgeous palace!\nNurse. There's no trust,\nNo faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,\nAll forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.\nAh, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.\nThese griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.\nShame come to Romeo!\nJul. Blister'd be thy tongue\nFor such a wish! He was not born to shame.\nUpon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;\nFor 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd\nSole monarch of the universal earth.\nO, what a beast was I to chide at him!\nNurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?\nJul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\nAh, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name\nWhen I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?\nBut wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\nThat villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.\nBack, foolish tears, back to your native spring!\nYour tributary drops belong to woe,\nWhich you, mistaking, offer up to joy.\nMy husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;\nAnd Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.\nAll this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?\nSome word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,\nThat murd'red me. I would forget it fain;\nBut O, it presses to my memory\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!\n'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'\nThat 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there;\nOr, if sour woe delights in fellowship\nAnd needly will be rank'd with other griefs,\nWhy followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'\nThy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,\nWhich modern lamentation might have mov'd?\nBut with a rearward following Tybalt's death,\n'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\nAll slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-\nThere is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\nIn that word's death; no words can that woe sound.\nWhere is my father and my mother, nurse?\nNurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.\nWill you go to them? I will bring you thither.\nJul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,\nWhen theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.\nTake up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,\nBoth you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.\nHe made you for a highway to my bed;\nBut I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.\nCome, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;\nAnd death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!\nNurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo\nTo comfort you. I wot well where he is.\nHark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.\nI'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.\nJul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight\nAnd bid him come to take his last farewell.\nExeunt.",

Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.\nAffliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,\nAnd thou art wedded to calamity.\nEnter Romeo.\nRom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand\nThat I yet know not?\nFriar. Too familiar\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\nI bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.\nRom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?\nFriar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-\nNot body's death, but body's banishment.\nRom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\nMuch more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'\nFriar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\nRom. There is no world without Verona walls,\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\nHence banished is banish'd from the world,\nAnd world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'\nIs death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'\nThou cut'st my head off with a golden axe\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\nFriar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!\nThy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,\nTaking thy part, hath brush'd aside the law,\nAnd turn'd that black word death to banishment.\nThis is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.\nRom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,\nWhere Juliet lives; and every cat and dog\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\nLive here in heaven and may look on her;\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\nIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty,\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;\nBut Romeo may not- he is banished.\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly;\nThey are free men, but I am banished.\nAnd sayest thou yet that exile is not death?\nHadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,\nBut 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?\nO friar, the damned use that word in hell;\nHowling attends it! How hast thou the heart,\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,\nTo mangle me with that word 'banished'?\nFriar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.\nRom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\nFriar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;\nAdversity's sweet milk, philosophy,\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\nRom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\nDisplant a town, reverse a prince's doom,\nIt helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.\nFriar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.\nRom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\nFriar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.\nRom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\nAn hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\nThen mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\nAnd fall upon the ground, as I do now,\nTaking the measure of an unmade grave.\nKnock [within].\nFriar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\nRom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,\nMist-like infold me from the search of eyes. Knock.\nFriar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;\nThou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up; Knock.\nRun to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,\nWhat simpleness is this.- I come, I come! Knock.\nWho knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will?\nNurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\nI come from Lady Juliet.\nFriar. Welcome then.\nEnter Nurse.\nNurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,\nWhere is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?\nFriar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.\nNurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,\nJust in her case!\nFriar. O woeful sympathy!\nPiteous predicament!\nNurse. Even so lies she,\nBlubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\nStand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.\nFor Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!\nWhy should you fall into so deep an O?\nRom. (rises) Nurse-\nNurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.\nRom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\nDoth not she think me an old murtherer,\nNow I have stain'd the childhood of our joy\nWith blood remov'd but little from her own?\nWhere is she? and how doth she! and what says\nMy conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?\nNurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\nAnd Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,\nAnd then down falls again.\nRom. As if that name,\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\nDid murther her; as that name's cursed hand\nMurder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,\nIn what vile part of this anatomy\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\nThe hateful mansion. [Draws his dagger.]\nFriar. Hold thy desperate hand.\nArt thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;\nThy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\nThe unreasonable fury of a beast.\nUnseemly woman in a seeming man!\nOr ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\nThou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,\nI thought thy disposition better temper'd.\nHast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\nAnd slay thy lady that in thy life lives,\nBy doing damned hate upon thyself?\nWhy railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?\nSince birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet\nIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\nFie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\nWhich, like a usurer, abound'st in all,\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax\nDigressing from the valour of a man;\nThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\nKilling that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;\nThy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\nLike powder in a skilless soldier's flask,\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\nAnd thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.\nWhat, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\nBut thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.\nThe law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend\nAnd turns it to exile. There art thou happy.\nA pack of blessings light upon thy back;\nHappiness courts thee in her best array;\nBut, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,\nThou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.\nTake heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\nGo get thee to thy love, as was decreed,\nAscend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\nBut look thou stay not till the watch be set,\nFor then thou canst not pass to Mantua,\nWhere thou shalt live till we can find a time\nTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\nBeg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\nWith twenty hundred thousand times more joy\nThan thou went'st forth in lamentation.\nGo before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\nAnd bid her hasten all the house to bed,\nWhich heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\nRomeo is coming.\nNurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night\nTo hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\nMy lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.\nRom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\nNurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.\nHie you, make haste, for it grows very late. Exit.\nRom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!\nFriar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:\nEither be gone before the watch be set,\nOr by the break of day disguis'd from hence.\nSojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,\nAnd he shall signify from time to time\nEvery good hap to you that chances here.\nGive me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.\nRom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,\nIt were a grief so brief to part with thee.\nFarewell.\nExeunt.",

Hie hence, be gone, away!\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,\nStraining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\nSome say the lark makes sweet division;\nThis doth not so, for she divideth us.\nSome say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;\nO, now I would they had chang'd voices too,\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\nHunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!\nO, now be gone! More light and light it grows.\nRom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!\nEnter Nurse.\nNurse. Madam!\nJul. Nurse?\nNurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.\nThe day is broke; be wary, look about.\nJul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.\n[Exit.]\nRom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.\nHe goeth down.\nJul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?\nI must hear from thee every day in the hour,\nFor in a minute there are many days.\nO, by this count I shall be much in years\nEre I again behold my Romeo!\nRom. Farewell!\nI will omit no opportunity\nThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\nJul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?\nRom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve\nFor sweet discourses in our time to come.\nJul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!\nMethinks I see thee, now thou art below,\nAs one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\nEither my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.\nRom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\nDry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!\nExit.\nJul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.\nIf thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\nThat is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,\nFor then I hope thou wilt not keep him long\nBut send him back.\nLady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?\nJul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.\nIs she not down so late, or up so early?\nWhat unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?\nEnter Mother.\nLady. Why, how now, Juliet?\nJul. Madam, I am not well.\nLady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?\nWhat, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\nAn if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\nTherefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;\nBut much of grief shows still some want of wit.\nJul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\nLady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\nWhich you weep for.\nJul. Feeling so the loss,\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\nLady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death\nAs that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.\nJul. What villain, madam?\nLady. That same villain Romeo.\nJul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-\nGod pardon him! I do, with all my heart;\nAnd yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\nLady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.\nJul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.\nWould none but I might venge my cousin's death!\nLady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\nThen weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,\nWhere that same banish'd runagate doth live,\nShall give him such an unaccustom'd dram\nThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company;\nAnd then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\nJul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied\nWith Romeo till I behold him- dead-\nIs my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.\nMadam, if you could find out but a man\nTo bear a poison, I would temper it;\nThat Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\nSoon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\nTo hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,\nTo wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt\nUpon his body that hath slaughter'd him!\nLady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.\nBut now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\nJul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.\nWhat are they, I beseech your ladyship?\nLady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\nOne who, to put thee from thy heaviness,\nHath sorted out a sudden day of joy\nThat thou expects not nor I look'd not for.\nJul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?\nLady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn\nThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\nThe County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,\nShall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\nJul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,\nHe shall not make me there a joyful bride!\nI wonder at this haste, that I must wed\nEre he that should be husband comes to woo.\nI pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\nI will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\nIt shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\nRather than Paris. These are news indeed!\nLady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,\nAnd see how he will take it at your hands.\nEnter Capulet and Nurse.\nCap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,\nBut for the sunset of my brother's son\nIt rains downright.\nHow now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\nEvermore show'ring? In one little body\nThou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:\nFor still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\nDo ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is\nSailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,\nWho, raging with thy tears and they with them,\nWithout a sudden calm will overset\nThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\nHave you delivered to her our decree?\nLady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\nI would the fool were married to her grave!\nCap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.\nHow? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\nIs she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\nUnworthy as she is, that we have wrought\nSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\nJul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.\nProud can I never be of what I hate,\nBut thankful even for hate that is meant love.\nCap. How now, how now, choplogic? What is this?\n'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-\nAnd yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,\nThank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\nBut fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next\nTo go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\nOut, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!\nYou tallow-face!\nLady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?\nJul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,\nHear me with patience but to speak a word.\nCap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!\nI tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday\nOr never after look me in the face.\nSpeak not, reply not, do not answer me!\nMy fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest\nThat God had lent us but this only child;\nBut now I see this one is one too much,\nAnd that we have a curse in having her.\nOut on her, hilding!\nNurse. God in heaven bless her!\nYou are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\nCap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,\nGood Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!\nNurse. I speak no treason.\nCap. O, God-i-god-en!\nNurse. May not one speak?\nCap. Peace, you mumbling fool!\nUtter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,\nFor here we need it not.\nLady. You are too hot.\nCap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,\nAt home, abroad, alone, in company,\nWaking or sleeping, still my care hath been\nTo have her match'd; and having now provided\nA gentleman of princely parentage,\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,\nStuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,\nProportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-\nAnd then to have a wretched puling fool,\nA whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,\nTo answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;\nI am too young, I pray you pardon me'!\nBut, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me.\nLook to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:\nAn you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;\nAn you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\nFor, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,\nNor what is mine shall never do thee good.\nTrust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn. Exit.\nJul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds\nThat sees into the bottom of my grief?\nO sweet my mother, cast me not away!\nDelay this marriage for a month, a week;\nOr if you do not, make the bridal bed\nIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\nLady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.\nDo as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. Exit.\nJul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?\nMy husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.\nHow shall that faith return again to earth\nUnless that husband send it me from heaven\nBy leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.\nAlack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems\nUpon so soft a subject as myself!\nWhat say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?\nSome comfort, nurse.\nNurse. Faith, here it is.\nRomeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing\nThat he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;\nOr if he do, it needs must be by stealth.\nThen, since the case so stands as now it doth,\nI think it best you married with the County.\nO, he's a lovely gentleman!\nRomeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,\nHath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\nAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,\nI think you are happy in this second match,\nFor it excels your first; or if it did not,\nYour first is dead- or 'twere as good he were\nAs living here and you no use of him.\nJul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?\nNurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.\nJul. Amen!\nNurse. What?\nJul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.\nGo in; and tell my lady I am gone,\nHaving displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,\nTo make confession and to be absolv'd.\nNurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. Exit.",

You say you do not know the lady's mind.\nUneven is the course; I like it not.\nPar. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,\nAnd therefore have I little talk'd of love;\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway,\nAnd in his wisdom hastes our marriage\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\nMay be put from her by society.\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\nFriar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\nEnter Juliet.\nPar. Happily met, my lady and my wife!\nJul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\nPar. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.\nJul. What must be shall be.\nFriar. That's a certain text.\nPar. Come you to make confession to this father?\nJul. To answer that, I should confess to you.\nPar. Do not deny to him that you love me.\nJul. I will confess to you that I love him.\nPar. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\nJul. If I do so, it will be of more price,\nBeing spoke behind your back, than to your face.\nPar. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.\nJul. The tears have got small victory by that,\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\nPar. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.\nJul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\nPar. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.\nJul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\nOr shall I come to you at evening mass?\nFriar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\nMy lord, we must entreat the time alone.\nPar. God shield I should disturb devotion!\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.\nTill then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. Exit.\nJul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\nCome weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!\nFriar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\nJul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\nIf in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\nDo thou but call my resolution wise\nAnd with this knife I'll help it presently.\nGod join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,\nShall be the label to another deed,\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\nTherefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,\nGive me some present counsel; or, behold,\n'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\nCould to no issue of true honour bring.\nBe not so long to speak. I long to die\nIf what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.\nFriar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\nA thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat cop'st with death himself to scape from it;\nAnd, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.\nJul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\nFrom off the battlements of yonder tower,\nOr walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,\nOr shut me nightly in a charnel house,\nO'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud-\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt,\nTo live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.\nFriar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.\nTo-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\nLet not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\nTake thou this vial, being then in bed,\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off;\nWhen presently through all thy veins shall run\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\nShall keep his native progress, but surcease;\nNo warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\nThe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\nTo paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall\nLike death when he shuts up the day of life;\nEach part, depriv'd of supple government,\nShall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;\nAnd in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death\nThou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\nNow, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\nThen, as the manner of our country is,\nIn thy best robes uncovered on the bier\nThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\nWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\nIn the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\nShall Romeo by my letters know our drift;\nAnd hither shall he come; and he and I\nWill watch thy waking, and that very night\nShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\nAnd this shall free thee from this present shame,\nIf no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\nAbate thy valour in the acting it.\nJul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\nFriar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous\nIn this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed\nTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\nJul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.\nFarewell, dear father.\nExeunt.",

Meagre were his looks,\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones;\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\nAn alligator stuff'd, and other skins\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\nWere thinly scattered, to make up a show.\nNoting this penury, to myself I said,\n'An if a man did need a poison now\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\nBeing holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho!\napothecary!\nEnter Apothecary.\nApoth. Who calls so loud?\nRom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\nA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins\nThat the life-weary taker mall fall dead,\nAnd that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath\nAs violently as hasty powder fir'd\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.\nApoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law\nIs death to any he that utters them.\nRom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness\nAnd fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\nNeed and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich;\nThen be not poor, but break it and take this.\nApoth. My poverty but not my will consents.\nRom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.\nApoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will\nAnd drink it off, and if you had the strength\nOf twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.\nRom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,\nDoing more murther in this loathsome world,\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\nI sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.\nFarewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me\nTo Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.\nExeunt.",

Then all alone\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred's vault;\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience;\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\nAll this I know, and to the marriage\nHer nurse is privy; and if aught in this\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrific'd, some hour before his time,\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\nPrince. We still have known thee for a holy man.\nWhere's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?\nBal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\nAnd threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not and left him there.\nPrince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.\nWhere is the County's page that rais'd the watch?\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\nBoy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\nAnd by-and-by my master drew on him;\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\nPrince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death;\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\nAnd I, for winking at you, discords too,\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.\nCap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter's jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\nMon. But I can give thee more;\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\nCap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity!\nPrince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\nSome shall be pardon'd, and some punished;\nFor never was a story of more woe",
