Most of the confidences were unsought\u2014frequently I have\nfeigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\nsome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\nthe horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\nthe terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\nmarred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\ninfinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I\nforget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\nrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out\nunequally at birth.",

Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction\u2014Gatsby, who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n\"creative temperament\"\u2014it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a\nromantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and\nwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again.

His family were enormously wealthy\u2014even in college his\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach\u2014but now he'd left Chicago\nand come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\ninstance, he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\nForest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was\nwealthy enough to do that.\nWhy they came East I don't know.

The lawn started at\nthe beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,\njumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens\u2014finally when\nit reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though\nfrom the momentum of its run.

Now he was a sturdy\nstraw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a\nsupercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\ndominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\naggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\nclothes could hide the enormous power of that body\u2014he seemed to fill\nthose glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\nsee a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his\nthin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage\u2014a cruel body.\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\nfractiousness he conveyed.

The\nwindows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside\nthat seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through\nthe room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale\nflags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the\nceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow\non it as wind does on the sea.\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous\ncouch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an\nanchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were\nrippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a\nshort flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments\nlistening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a\npicture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the\nrear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the\ncurtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the\nfloor.\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full\nlength at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her\nchin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which\nwas quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes\nshe gave no hint of it\u2014indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring\nan apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise\u2014she leaned slightly\nforward with a conscientious expression\u2014then she laughed, an absurd,\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\nroom.\n\"I'm p-paralysed with happiness.\"\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my\nhand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was\nno one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she\nhad. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was\nBaker. (I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less\ncharming.)\nAt any rate, Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\nimperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again\u2014the object",

Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.\nAlmost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned\ntribute from me.\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\ndown, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\na singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had\ndone gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\n\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\n\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\npainted black as a mourning wreath, and there's a persistent wail all\nnight along the north shore.\"\n\"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\nirrelevantly: \"You ought to see the baby.\"\n\"I'd like to.\"\n\"She's asleep. She's three years old. Haven't you ever seen her?\"\n\"Never.\"\n\"Well, you ought to see her. She's\u2014\"\nTom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\n\"What you doing, Nick?\"\n\"I'm a bond man.\"\n\"Who with?\"\nI told him.\n\"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\nThis annoyed me.\n\"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\n\"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,\" he said, glancing at\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something\nmore. \"I'd be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\nAt this point Miss Baker said: \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that\nI started\u2014it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the\nroom. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned\nand with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n\"I'm stiff,\" she complained, \"I've been lying on that sofa for as long\nas I can remember.\"\n\"Don't look at me,\" Daisy retorted, \"I've been trying to get you to\nNew York all afternoon.\"\n\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\npantry. \"I'm absolutely in training.\"\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom\nof a glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\nI looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I\nenjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with\nan erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward\nat the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked\nback at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,\ndiscontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a\npicture of her, somewhere before.\n\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\nthere.\"\n\"I don't know a single\u2014\"\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\n\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two\nyoung women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward\nthe sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the\ndiminished wind.\n\"Why candles?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\nfingers. \"In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year.\" She\nlooked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in\nthe year and then miss it.\"\n\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\n\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What'll we plan?\" She turned to me\nhelplessly: \"What do people plan?\"\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\nlittle finger.\n\"Look!\" she complained; \"I hurt it.\"\nWe all looked\u2014the knuckle was black and blue.\n\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn't mean to,\nbut you did do it.

            "text": "at the apartment door.\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,\nwith a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky\nwhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\nrakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\nhaste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I\nwondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed\nimmoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a\ngirl friend at a hotel.\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just\nshaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\ninformed me that he was in the \"artistic game,\" and I gathered later\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of\nMrs. Wilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His\nwife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with\npride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven\ntimes since they had been married.\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,\nwhich gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With\nthe influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.",

At high tide in the\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\nfoam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\nto and from the city between nine in the morning and long past\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra\ngardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a\nfruiterer in New York\u2014every Monday these same oranges and lemons left\nhis back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in\nthe kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in\nhalf an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a\nbutler's thumb.\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\nhundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas\ntree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\nglistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark\ngold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and\nstocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that\nmost of his female guests were too young to know one from another.\nBy seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\ncornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have\ncome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from\nNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and\nsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in\nstrange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is\nin full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden\noutside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual\ninnuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic\nmeetings between women who never knew each other's names.\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and\nnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of\nvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute,\nspilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups\nchange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\nsame breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave\nhere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,\njoyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,\nglide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under\nthe constantly changing light.",

I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.\"\nHe smiled understandingly\u2014much more than understandingly. It was one\nof those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that\nyou may come across four or five times in life. It faced\u2014or seemed to\nface\u2014the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on\nyou with an irresistible prejudice in your favour.

I would\nhave accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from\nthe swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That\nwas comprehensible. But young men didn't\u2014at least in my provincial\ninexperience I believed they didn't\u2014drift coolly out of nowhere and\nbuy a palace on Long Island Sound.\n\"Anyhow, he gives large parties,\" said Jordan, changing the subject\nwith an urban distaste for the concrete. \"And I like large parties.\nThey're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.\"\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra\nleader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he cried. \"At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are\ngoing to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff's latest work, which\nattracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the\npapers you know there was a big sensation.\" He smiled with jovial\ncondescension, and added: \"Some sensation!\" Whereupon everybody\nlaughed.\n\"The piece is known,\" he concluded lustily, \"as 'Vladmir Tostoff's\nJazz History of the World!'\u200a\"\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as it\nbegan my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and\nlooking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin\nwas drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as\nthough it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about\nhim. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him\noff from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as\nthe fraternal hilarity increased. When the \"Jazz History of the World\"\nwas over, girls were putting their heads on men's shoulders in a\npuppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into\nmen's arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their\nfalls\u2014but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched\nGatsby's shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby's\nhead for one link.\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\nGatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n\"Miss Baker?\" he inquired. \"I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would\nlike to speak to you alone.\"\n\"With me?\" she exclaimed in surprise.\n\"Yes, madame.\"\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and\nfollowed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her\nevening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes\u2014there was a\njauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk\nupon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.",

            "text": "I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\nintriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which\noverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate, who was now\nengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\nimplored me to join him, I went inside.\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\nplaying the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady\nfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\nchampagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,\nthat everything was very, very sad\u2014she was not only singing, she was\nweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\ngasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\nsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks\u2014not freely, however, for\nwhen they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they\nassumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow\nblack rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes\non her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and\nwent off into a deep vinous sleep.\n\"She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband,\" explained a\ngirl at my elbow.\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\nwith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet\nfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\ntalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after\nattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\nway, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks\u2014at intervals\nshe appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:\n\"You promised!\" into his ear.\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall\nwas at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly\nindignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in\nslightly raised voices.\n\"Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home.\"\n\"Never heard anything so selfish in my life.\"\n\"We're always the first ones to leave.\"\n\"So are we.\"\n\"Well, we're almost the last tonight,\" said one of the men sheepishly.\n\"The orchestra left half an hour ago.\"\nIn spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond\ncredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives\nwere lifted, kicking, into the night.\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\nJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last\nword to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\nformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\nJordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she\nlingered for a moment to shake hands.\n\"I've just heard the most amazing thing,\" she whispered. \"How long\nwere we in there?\"\n\"Why, about an hour.\"\n\"It was \u2026 simply amazing,\" she repeated abstractedly. \"But I swore I\nwouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\" She yawned gracefully\nin my face. \"Please come and see me \u2026 Phone book \u2026 Under the name of\nMrs. Sigourney Howard \u2026 My aunt \u2026\" She was hurrying off as she\ntalked\u2014her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her\nparty at the door.\nRather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I\njoined the last of Gatsby's guests, who were clustered around him. I\nwanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to\napologize for not having known him in the garden.\n\"Don't mention it,\" he enjoined me eagerly. \"Don't give it another\nthought, old sport.\" The familiar expression held no more familiarity\nthan the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. \"And don't\nforget we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine\no'clock.\"\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n\"Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.\"\n\"All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there \u2026 Good night.\"\n\"Good night.\"\n\"Good night.\" He smiled\u2014and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant\nsignificance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired\nit all the time. \"Good night, old sport \u2026 Good night.\"\nBut as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite\nover. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a\nbizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side\nup, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coup\u00e9 which had\nleft Gatsby's drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall\naccounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting\nconsiderable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,\nas they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din\nfrom those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to\nthe already violent confusion of the scene.\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the\ntyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n\"See!\" he explained. \"It went in the ditch.\"\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the\nunusual quality of wonder, and then the man\u2014it was the late patron of\nGatsby's library.\n\"How'd it happen?\"\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,\" he said decisively.\n\"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?\"\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole\nmatter. \"I know very little about driving\u2014next to nothing. It\nhappened, and that's all I know.\"\n\"Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night.\"\n\"But I wasn't even trying,\" he explained indignantly, \"I wasn't even\ntrying.\"\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n\"Do you want to commit suicide?\"\n\"You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!\"\n\"You don't understand,\" explained the criminal. \"I wasn't driving.\nThere's another man in the car.\"\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\n\"Ah-h-h!\" as the door of the coup\u00e9 swung slowly open. The crowd\u2014it was\nnow a crowd\u2014stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened\nwide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a\npale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively\nat the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\ngroaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment\nbefore he perceived the man in the duster.\n\"Wha's matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"Did we run outa gas?\"\n\"Look!\"\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel\u2014he stared at it\nfor a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it\nhad dropped from the sky.\n\"It came off,\" someone explained.\nHe nodded.\n\"At first I din' notice we'd stopped.\"\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\n\"Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?\"\nAt least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any\nphysical bond.\n\"Back out,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put her in reverse.\"\n\"But the wheel's off!\"\nHe hesitated.\n\"No harm in trying,\" he said.\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a\nmoon was shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before,\nand surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.\nA sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.",

            "text": "------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were\nall that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events\nin a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me\ninfinitely less than my personal affairs.\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my\nshadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York\nto the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen\nby their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded\nrestaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I\neven had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and\nworked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing\nmean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I\nlet it blow quietly away.\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club\u2014for some reason it was the\ngloomiest event of my day\u2014and then I went upstairs to the library and\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There\nwere generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the\nlibrary, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\nmellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,\nand over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue\nand pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and\nsmiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm\ndarkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting\nloneliness sometimes, and felt it in others\u2014poor young clerks who\nloitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary\nrestaurant dinner\u2014young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant\nmoments of night and life.\nAgain at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined\nfive deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I\nfelt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they\nwaited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,\nand lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining\nthat I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I\nfound her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,\nbecause she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it\nwas something more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world\nconcealed something\u2014most affectations conceal something eventually,\neven though they don't in the beginning\u2014and one day I found what it\nwas. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a\nborrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about\nit\u2014and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me\nthat night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers\u2014a suggestion that she had moved\nher ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached\nthe proportions of a scandal\u2014then died away. A caddy retracted his\nstatement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\nShe wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to\nthe world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you\nnever blame deeply\u2014I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on\nthat same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving\na car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\nfender flicked a button on one man's coat.\n\"You're a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more\ncareful, or you oughtn't to drive at all.\"\n\"I am careful.\"\n\"No, you're not.\"\n\"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly.\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"\n\"They'll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an\naccident.\"\n\"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\"\n\"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That's\nwhy I like you.\"\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as\nbrakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself\ndefinitely out of that tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once\na week and signing them: \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think of was\nhow, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of\nperspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague\nunderstanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\nEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever\nknown.",

Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there\ncrystal glass.\"\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of\nthose who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old timetable\nnow, disintegrating at its folds, and headed \"This schedule in effect\nJuly 5th, 1922.\" But I can still read the grey names, and they will\ngive you a better impression than my generalities of those who\naccepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of\nknowing nothing whatever about him.\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a\nman named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\nVoltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came\nnear. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and\nMr. Chrystie's wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,\nin white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the\ngarden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.\nR. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the\nFishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he\nwent to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that\nMrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies\ncame, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice\nA. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and\nBeluga's girls.\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\nS. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his\nwife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\n(\"Rot-Gut\") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly\u2014they came to\ngamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\nnext day.\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as\n\"the boarder\"\u2014I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people\nthere were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Myer and George\nDuckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the\nBackhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and\nthe Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the\nSmirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who\nkilled himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\nthe same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\nforgotten their names\u2014Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves\nto be.\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had\nhis nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,\nhis fianc\u00e9e, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of\nthe American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be\nher chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and\nwhose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\nAll these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.",

            "text": "At nine o'clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby's gorgeous car\nlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody\nfrom its three-noted horn.\nIt was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of\nhis parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,\nmade frequent use of his beach.\n\"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I\nthought we'd ride up together.\"\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American\u2014that comes,\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,\nwith the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality\nwas continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape\nof restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping\nfoot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?\" He jumped off to give me a better\nview. \"Haven't you ever seen it before?\"\nI'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with\na labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down\nbehind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,\nwe started to town.\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an\nelaborate roadhouse next door.\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured\nsuit.\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly, \"what's your\nopinion of me, anyhow?\"\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that\nquestion deserves.\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted.\n\"I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you\nhear.\"\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation\nin his halls.\n\"I'll tell you God's truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine\nretribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the\nMiddle West\u2014all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at\nOxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many\nyears. It is a family tradition.\"\nHe looked at me sideways\u2014and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he\nwas lying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed\nit, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with\nthis doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if\nthere wasn't something a little sinister about him, after all.\n\"What part of the Middle West?\" I inquired casually.\n\"San Francisco.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a\nclan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling\nmy leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\nEurope\u2014Paris, Venice, Rome\u2014collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\"\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that\nof a turbaned \"character\" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued\na tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\n\"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very\nhard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\ntook the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there\nwas a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't\nadvance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty\nmen with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last\nthey found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of\ndead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave\nme a decoration\u2014even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the\nAdriatic Sea!\"\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them\u2014with his\nsmile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,\nfell into my palm.\n\"That's the one from Montenegro.\"\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. \"Orderi di\nDanilo,\" ran the circular legend, \"Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.\"\n\"Turn it.\"\n\"Major Jay Gatsby,\" I read, \"For Valour Extraordinary.\"\n\"Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It\nwas taken in Trinity Quad\u2014the man on my left is now the Earl of\nDoncaster.\"\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\nlooking a little, not much, younger\u2014with a cricket bat in his hand.\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n\"I'm going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something\nabout me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,\nI usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there\ntrying to forget the sad things that happened to me.\" He hesitated.\n\"You'll hear about it this afternoon.\"\n\"At lunch?\"\n\"No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss\nBaker to tea.\"\n\"Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?\"\n\"No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak\nto you about this matter.\"\nI hadn't the faintest idea what \"this matter\" was, but I was more\nannoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to\ndiscuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something\nutterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon\nhis overpopulated lawn.\nHe wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared\nthe city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of\nred-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with\nthe dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.\nThen the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a\nglimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting\nvitality as we went by.\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half\nAstoria\u2014only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated\nI heard the familiar \"jug-jug-spat!\" of a motorcycle, and a frantic\npoliceman rode alongside.\n\"All right, old sport,\" called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white\ncard from his wallet, he waved it before the man's eyes.\n\"Right you are,\" agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. \"Know you next\ntime, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!\"\n\"What was that?\" I inquired. \"The picture of Oxford?\"\n\"I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a\nChristmas card every year.\"\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a\nconstant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across\nthe river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of\nnonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always\nthe city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the\nmystery and the beauty in the world.\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two\ncarriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for\nfriends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short\nupper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of\nGatsby's splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we\ncrossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white\nchauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I\nlaughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in\nhaughty rivalry.\n\"Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge,\" I thought;\n\"anything at all \u2026\"\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------",

            "text": "Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n\"Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.\"\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a\nmoment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\n\"\u2014So I took one look at him,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand\nearnestly, \"and what do you think I did?\"\n\"What?\" I inquired politely.\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n\"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: 'All right, Katspaugh,\ndon't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and\nthere.\"\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\nrestaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n\"Highballs?\" asked the head waiter.\n\"This is a nice restaurant here,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the\npresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \"But I like across the street\nbetter!\"\n\"Yes, highballs,\" agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: \"It's too\nhot over there.\"\n\"Hot and small\u2014yes,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, \"but full of memories.\"\n\"What place is that?\" I asked.\n\"The old Metropole.\"\n\"The old Metropole,\" brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. \"Filled with\nfaces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't\nforget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It\nwas six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all\nevening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a\nfunny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All\nright,' says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his\nchair.\n\"\u200a'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't\nyou, so help me, move outside this room.'\n\"It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the\nblinds we'd of seen daylight.\"\n\"Did he go?\" I asked innocently.\n\"Sure he went.\" Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed at me indignantly. \"He\nturned around in the door and says: 'Don't let that waiter take away\nmy coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three\ntimes in his full belly and drove away.\"\n\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering.\n\"Five, with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\n\"I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion.\"\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\nfor me:\n\"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn't the man.\"\n\"No?\" Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\n\"This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other\ntime.\"\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, \"I had a wrong man.\"\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around\nthe room\u2014he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people\ndirectly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have\ntaken one short glance beneath our own table.\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I'm afraid I\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\n\"I don't like mysteries,\" I answered, \"and I don't understand why you\nwon't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got\nto come through Miss Baker?\"\n\"Oh, it's nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker's a great\nsportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all\nright.\"\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his\neyes. \"Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect\ngentleman.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"He's an Oggsford man.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\n\"I've heard of it.\"\n\"It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure\nof his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a\nman of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to\nmyself: 'There's the kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce\nto your mother and sister.'\u200a\" He paused. \"I see you're looking at my\ncuff buttons.\"\nI hadn't been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\n\"Well!\" I inspected them. \"That's a very interesting idea.\"\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \"Yeah, Gatsby's very\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's\nwife.\"\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and\nsat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his\nfeet.\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I'm going to run off from you\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\n\"Don't hurry Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\"You're very polite, but I belong to another generation,\" he announced\nsolemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies\nand your\u2014\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\nhand. \"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself on\nyou any longer.\"\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I\nwondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is\none of his sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York\u2014a\ndenizen of Broadway.\"\n\"Who is he, anyhow, an actor?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"A dentist?\"\n\"Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he's a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added,\ncoolly: \"He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919.\"\n\"Fixed the World's Series?\" I repeated.\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World's\nSeries had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I\nwould have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of\nsome inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could\nstart to play with the faith of fifty million people\u2014with the\nsingle-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.\n\"How did he happen to do that?\" I asked after a minute.\n\"He just saw the opportunity.\"\n\"Why isn't he in jail?\"\n\"They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man.\"\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I\ncaught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\"Come along with me for a minute,\" I said; \"I've got to say hello to\nsomeone.\"\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our\ndirection.\n\"Where've you been?\" he demanded eagerly. \"Daisy's furious because you\nhaven't called up.\"\n\"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\"\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of\nembarrassment came over Gatsby's face.\n\"How've you been, anyhow?\" demanded Tom of me. \"How'd you happen to\ncome up this far to eat?\"\n\"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\"\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.",

            "text": "One October day in nineteen-seventeen\u2014\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a\nstraight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n\u2014I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks\nand half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on\nshoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the\nsoft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the\nwind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in\nfront of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,\nin a disapproving way.\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\nDaisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that\nnight. \"Anyways, for an hour!\"\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was\nbeside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had\nnever seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she\ndidn't see me until I was five feet away.\n\"Hello, Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\"\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the\nolder girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red\nCross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she\ncouldn't come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was\nspeaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at\nsometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the\nincident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn't lay eyes on\nhim again for over four years\u2014even after I'd met him on Long Island I\ndidn't realize it was the same man.\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux\nmyself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very\noften. She went with a slightly older crowd\u2014when she went with anyone\nat all. Wild rumours were circulating about her\u2014how her mother had\nfound her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say\ngoodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually\nprevented, but she wasn't on speaking terms with her family for\nseveral weeks. After that she didn't play around with the soldiers any\nmore, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,\nwho couldn't get into the army at all.\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a d\u00e9but\nafter the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,\nwith more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He\ncame down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a\nwhole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he\ngave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand\ndollars.\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the\nbridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June\nnight in her flowered dress\u2014and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle\nof Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\"\u200a'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before, but oh how\nI do enjoy it.\"\n\"What's the matter, Daisy?\"\nI was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.\n\"Here, dearies.\" She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \"Take 'em downstairs\nand give 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's\nchange' her mine. Say: 'Daisy's change' her mine!'\u200a\"\nShe began to cry\u2014she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\nmother's maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.\nShe wouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her\nand squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\nsoap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\nBut she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and\nput ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half\nan hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around\nher neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she\nmarried Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a\nthree months' trip to the South Seas.\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I'd\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\nminute she'd look around uneasily, and say: \"Where's Tom gone?\" and\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the\nhour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with\nunfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together\u2014it made you\nlaugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I\nleft Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,\nand ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got\ninto the papers, too, because her arm was broken\u2014she was one of the\nchambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for\na year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and\nthen they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in\nChicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young\nand rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect\nreputation. Perhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage\nnot to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and,\nmoreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that\neverybody else is so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy\nnever went in for amour at all\u2014and yet there's something in that voice\nof hers \u2026\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first\ntime in years. It was when I asked you\u2014do you remember?\u2014if you knew\nGatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and\nwoke me up, and said: \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him\u2014I was\nhalf asleep\u2014she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man\nshe used to know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby\nwith the officer in her white car.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\nfor half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\nthe West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered\nlike crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\"I'm the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when\nyou're asleep Into your tent I'll creep\u2014\"\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said.\n\"But it wasn't a coincidence at all.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that\nJune night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of\nhis purposeless splendour.\n\"He wants to know,\" continued Jordan, \"if you'll invite Daisy to your\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and\nbought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths\u2014so that\nhe could \"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\n\"He's afraid, he's waited so long. He thought you might be\noffended. You see, he's regular tough underneath it all.\"\nSomething worried me.\n\"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?\"\n\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is\nright next door.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some\nnight,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It\nwas that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard\nthe elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\nsuggested a luncheon in New York\u2014and I thought he'd go mad:\n\"\u200a'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I\nwant to see her right next door.'\n\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's, he started to\nabandon the whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he\nsays he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of\ncatching a glimpse of Daisy's name.\"\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\naround Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her\nto dinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,\nbut of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal\nscepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my\narm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady\nexcitement: \"There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and\nthe tired.\"\n\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to\nme.\n\"Does she want to see Gatsby?\"\n\"She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're\njust supposed to invite her to tea.\"",

            "text": "When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\nmy house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the\npeninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery\nand made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a\ncorner, I saw that it was Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\nitself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in\nthe trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on\nagain as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned\naway I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\n\"Your place looks like the World's Fair,\" I said.\n\"Does it?\" He turned his eyes toward it absently. \"I have been\nglancing into some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old\nsport. In my car.\"\n\"It's too late.\"\n\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made\nuse of it all summer.\"\n\"I've got to go to bed.\"\n\"All right.\"\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\n\"I talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I'm going to call\nup Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\"\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don't want to put you\nto any trouble.\"\n\"What day would suit you?\"\n\"What day would suit you?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don't want to\nput you to any trouble, you see.\"\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\"\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: \"I want to get the\ngrass cut,\" he said.\nWe both looked down at the grass\u2014there was a sharp line where my\nragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I\nsuspected that he meant my grass.\n\"There's another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\n\"Would you rather put it off for a few days?\" I asked.\n\"Oh, it isn't about that. At least\u2014\" He fumbled with a series of\nbeginnings. \"Why, I thought\u2014why, look here, old sport, you don't make\nmuch money, do you?\"\n\"Not very much.\"\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\n\"I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my\u2014you see, I carry on a\nlittle business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And\nI thought that if you don't make very much\u2014You're selling bonds,\naren't you, old sport?\"\n\"Trying to.\"\n\"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your time\nand you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather\nconfidential sort of thing.\"\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation\nmight have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer\nwas obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no\nchoice except to cut him off there.\n\"I've got my hands full,\" I said. \"I'm much obliged but I couldn't\ntake on any more work.\"\n\"You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfshiem.\" Evidently he\nthought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at\nlunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,\nhoping I'd begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be\nresponsive, so he went unwillingly home.",

An hour\nlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel\nsuit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in.

Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a\nthree-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n\"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?\"\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I\nhad to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear\nalone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a\ndash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with\nglistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.\n\"Are you in love with me,\" she said low in my ear, \"or why did I have\nto come alone?\"\n\"That's the secret of Castle Rackrent.

To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.\n\"Well, that's funny,\" I exclaimed.\n\"What's funny?\"\nShe turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the\nfront door.

It\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder.\" I had seen him wandering hungrily\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own\napartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam's study, where we sat\ndown and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in\nthe wall.\nHe hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\nflight of stairs.\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all\u2014except where the dresser was\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\nwith delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n\"It's the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. \"I\ncan't\u2014When I try to\u2014\"\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a\nthird. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed\nwith wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long,\ndreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to\nspeak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,\nhe was running down like an over-wound clock.\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n\"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a\nselection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\"\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\nmany-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\nrich heap mounted higher\u2014shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of\nindian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\n\"They're such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\nthick folds. \"It makes me sad because I've never seen such\u2014such\nbeautiful shirts before.\"",

A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting\ncostume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n\"Who's this?\"\n\"That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\"\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n\"He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.\"\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the\nbureau\u2014Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly\u2014taken apparently\nwhen he was about eighteen.\n\"I adore it,\" exclaimed Daisy. \"The pompadour! You never told me you\nhad a pompadour\u2014or a yacht.\"\n\"Look at this,\" said Gatsby quickly. \"Here's a lot of clippings\u2014about\nyou.\"\nThey stood side by side examining it.

He was now decently\nclothed in a \"sport shirt,\" open at the neck, sneakers, and duck\ntrousers of a nebulous hue.\n\"Did we interrupt your exercise?\" inquired Daisy politely.\n\"I was asleep,\" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.\n\"That is, I'd been asleep. Then I got up \u2026\"\n\"Klipspringer plays the piano,\" said Gatsby, cutting him off. \"Don't\nyou, Ewing, old sport?\"\n\"I don't play well. I don't\u2014hardly play at all. I'm all out of prac\u2014\"\n\"We'll go downstairs,\" interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The\ngrey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.\nIn the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.\nHe lit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her\non a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the\ngleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\nWhen Klipspringer had played \"The Love Nest\" he turned around on the\nbench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n\"I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all\nout of prac\u2014\"\n\"Don't talk so much, old sport,\" commanded Gatsby. \"Play!\"\n\"In the morning, In the evening, Ain't we got fun\u2014\"\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along\nthe Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric\ntrains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New\nYork. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was\ngenerating on the air.\n\"One thing's sure and nothing's surer The rich get richer and the\npoor get\u2014children. In the meantime, In between time\u2014\"\nAs I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of\nbewilderment had come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt\nhad occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness.

            "text": "James Gatz\u2014that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had\nchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that\nwitnessed the beginning of his career\u2014when he saw Dan Cody's yacht\ndrop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was\nJames Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a\ntorn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay\nGatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and\ninformed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an\nhour.\nI suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His\nparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people\u2014his imagination\nhad never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was\nthat Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic\nconception of himself. He was a son of God\u2014a phrase which, if it means\nanything, means just that\u2014and he must be about His Father's business,\nthe service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented\njust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be\nlikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of\nLake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other\ncapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body\nlived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing\ndays. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became\ncontemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of\nthe others because they were hysterical about things which in his\noverwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque\nand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of\nineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock\nticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled\nclothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his\nfancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an\noblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for\nhis imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of\nreality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on\na fairy's wing.\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before,\nto the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf's in southern Minnesota. He\nstayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the\ndrums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's\nwork with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to\nLake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the\nday that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,\nof the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The\ntransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,\nsuspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him\nfrom his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye,\nthe newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and\nsent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid\njournalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable\nshores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny in\nLittle Girl Bay.\nTo young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,\nthat yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I\nsuppose he smiled at Cody\u2014he had probably discovered that people liked\nhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of\nthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and\nextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and\nbought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a\nyachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the\nBarbary Coast, Gatsby left too.\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity\u2014while he remained with\nCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even\njailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk\nmight soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by\nreposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five\nyears, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.\nIt might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye\ncame on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody\ninhospitably died.\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid\nman with a hard, empty face\u2014the pioneer debauchee, who during one\nphase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage\nviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to\nCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay\nparties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he\nformed the habit of letting liquor alone.\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money\u2014a legacy of twenty-five\nthousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal\ndevice that was used against him, but what remained of the millions\nwent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate\neducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the",

I remember very well.\"\n\"About two weeks ago.\"\n\"That's right. You were with Nick here.\"\n\"I know your wife,\" continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.\n\"That so?\"\nTom turned to me.\n\"You live near here, Nick?\"\n\"Next door.\"\n\"That so?\"\nMr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation, but lounged back\nhaughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either\u2014until\nunexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.\n\"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,\" she suggested.\n\"What do you say?\"\n\"Certainly; I'd be delighted to have you.\"\n\"Be ver' nice,\" said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. \"Well\u2014think ought\nto be starting home.\"\n\"Please don't hurry,\" Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself\nnow, and he wanted to see more of Tom. \"Why don't you\u2014why don't you\nstay for supper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped\nin from New York.\"\n\"You come to supper with me,\" said the lady enthusiastically. \"Both of\nyou.\"\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n\"Come along,\" he said\u2014but to her only.\n\"I mean it,\" she insisted. \"I'd love to have you. Lots of room.\"\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see\nthat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.\n\"I'm afraid I won't be able to,\" I said.\n\"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n\"We won't be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud.\n\"I haven't got a horse,\" said Gatsby. \"I used to ride in the army, but\nI've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse\nme for just a minute.\"\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady\nbegan an impassioned conversation aside.\n\"My God, I believe the man's coming,\" said Tom. \"Doesn't he know she\ndoesn't want him?\"\n\"She says she does want him.\"\n\"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.\" He\nfrowned. \"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be\nold-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to\nsuit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\"\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted\ntheir horses.\n\"Come on,\" said Mr. Sloane to Tom, \"we're late. We've got to go.\" And\nthen to me: \"Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?\"\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they\ntrotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage\njust as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the",

Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of\noppressiveness\u2014it stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties\nthat summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of\npeople, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,\nmany-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a\npervading harshness that hadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had\nmerely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete\nin itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to\nnothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was\nlooking at it again, through Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening\nto look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your\nown powers of adjustment.\nThey arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling\nhundreds, Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n\"These things excite me so,\" she whispered. \"If you want to kiss me\nany time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad\nto arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.\nI'm giving out green\u2014\"\n\"Look around,\" suggested Gatsby.\n\"I'm looking around. I'm having a marvellous\u2014\"\n\"You must see the faces of many people you've heard about.\"\nTom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n\"We don't go around very much,\" he said; \"in fact, I was just thinking\nI don't know a soul here.\"\n\"Perhaps you know that lady.\" Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely\nhuman orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom\nand Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies\nthe recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n\"She's lovely,\" said Daisy.\n\"The man bending over her is her director.\"\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n\"Mrs. Buchanan \u2026 and Mr. Buchanan\u2014\" After an instant's hesitation he\nadded: \"the polo player.\"\n\"Oh no,\" objected Tom quickly, \"not me.\"\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained \"the\npolo player\" for the rest of the evening.\n\"I've never met so many celebrities,\" Daisy exclaimed. \"I liked that\nman\u2014what was his name?\u2014with the sort of blue nose.\"\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n\"Well, I liked him anyhow.\"\n\"I'd a little rather not be the polo player,\" said Tom pleasantly,\n\"I'd rather look at all these famous people in\u2014in oblivion.\"\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,\nconservative foxtrot\u2014I had never seen him dance before. Then they\nsauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour,\nwhile at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. \"In case\nthere's a fire or a flood,\" she explained, \"or any act of God.\"\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper\ntogether. \"Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?\" he\nsaid. \"A fellow's getting off some funny stuff.\"\n\"Go ahead,\" answered Daisy genially, \"and if you want to take down any\naddresses here's my little gold pencil.\" \u2026 She looked around after a\nmoment and told me the girl was \"common but pretty,\" and I knew that\nexcept for the half-hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't\nhaving a good time.\nWe were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault\u2014Gatsby had\nbeen called to the phone, and I'd enjoyed these same people only two\nweeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air\nnow.\n\"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?\"\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my\nshoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n\"Wha'?\"\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf\nwith her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:\n\"Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she\nalways starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it\nalone.\"\n\"I do leave it alone,\" affirmed the accused hollowly.\n\"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody\nthat needs your help, Doc.'\u200a\"\n\"She's much obliged, I'm sure,\" said another friend, without\ngratitude, \"but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in\nthe pool.\"\n\"Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,\" mumbled Miss\nBaedeker. \"They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.\"\n\"Then you ought to leave it alone,\" countered Doctor Civet.\n\"Speak for yourself!\" cried Miss Baedeker violently. \"Your hand\nshakes. I wouldn't let you operate on me!\"\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with\nDaisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were\nstill under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except\nfor a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he\nhad been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this\nproximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate\ndegree and kiss at her cheek.\n\"I like her,\" said Daisy, \"I think she's lovely.\"\nBut the rest offended her\u2014and inarguably because it wasn't a gesture\nbut an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented\n\"place\" that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing\nvillage\u2014appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old\neuphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants\nalong a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in\nthe very simplicity she failed to understand.\nI sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.",

What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?\nPerhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\nand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would\nblot out those five years of unwavering devotion.\nI stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,\nand I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had\nrun up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights\nwere extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the\nsteps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,\nand his eyes were bright and tired.\n\"She didn't like it,\" he said immediately.\n\"Of course she did.\"\n\"She didn't like it,\" he insisted. \"She didn't have a good time.\"\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n\"I feel far away from her,\" he said. \"It's hard to make her\nunderstand.\"\n\"You mean about the dance?\"\n\"The dance?\" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\nhis fingers. \"Old sport, the dance is unimportant.\"\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and\nsay: \"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated four years with\nthat sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be\ntaken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back\nto Louisville and be married from her house\u2014just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n\"And she doesn't understand,\" he said. \"She used to be able to\nunderstand. We'd sit for hours\u2014\"\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit\nrinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.\n\"I wouldn't ask too much of her,\" I ventured. \"You can't repeat the\npast.\"\n\"Can't repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you\ncan!\"\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the\nshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\n\"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said,\nnodding determinedly. \"She'll see.\"\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to\nrecover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into\nloving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then,\nbut if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it\nall slowly, he could find out what that thing was \u2026\n\u2026 One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the\nstreet when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They\nstopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes\nof the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees\u2014he could\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\nHis heart beat faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He\nknew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable\nvisions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like\nthe mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the\ntuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At\nhis lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\nincarnation was complete.\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\nreminded of something\u2014an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,\nthat I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase\ntried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's,\nas though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled\nair. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was\nuncommunicable forever.",

Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis\ntook the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he\ndidn't. He supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside\nagain, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation\nbecause he heard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in\nthe garage.\n\"Beat me!\" he heard her cry. \"Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\nlittle coward!\"\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\nshouting\u2014before he could move from his door the business was over.\nThe \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then\ndisappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn't even sure of\nits colour\u2014he told the first policeman that it was light green.

At first I\ncouldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\nclamorously through the bare garage\u2014then I saw Wilson standing on the\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\nvoice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his\nshoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly\nfrom the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk\nback to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,\nhorrible call:\n\"Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around\nthe garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to\nthe policeman.\n\"M-a-v\u2014\" the policeman was saying, \"\u2014o\u2014\"\n\"No, r\u2014\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o\u2014\"\n\"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\n\"r\u2014\" said the policeman, \"o\u2014\"\n\"g\u2014\"\n\"g\u2014\" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n\"What you want, fella?\"\n\"What happened?\u2014that's what I want to know.\"\n\"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed.\"\n\"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\n\"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car.\"\n\"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin', one goin', see?\"\n\"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\n\"One goin' each way. Well, she\"\u2014his hand rose toward the blankets but\nstopped halfway and fell to his side\u2014\"she ran out there an' the one\ncomin' from N'York knock right into her, goin' thirty or forty miles\nan hour.\"\n\"What's the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\n\"Hasn't got any name.\"\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n\"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\n\"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\n\"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going\nfifty, sixty.\"\n\"Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\nname.\"\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in\nthe office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his\ngrasping cries:\n\"You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind\nof car it was!\"\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in\nfront of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n\"You've got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing\ngruffness.\nWilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n\"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute\nago, from New York. I was bringing you that coup\u00e9 we've been talking\nabout. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine\u2014do you\nhear? I haven't seen it all afternoon.\"\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\neyes.\n\"What's all that?\" he demanded.\n\"I'm a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\nWilson's body. \"He says he knows the car that did it \u2026 It was a yellow\ncar.\"\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n\"And what colour's your car?\"\n\"It's a blue car, a coup\u00e9.\"\n\"We've come straight from New York,\" I said.\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and\nthe policeman turned away.\n\"Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct\u2014\"\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set\nhim down in a chair, and came back.\n\"If somebody'll come here and sit with him,\" he snapped\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered: \"Let's get out.\"\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend\u2014then his foot came down\nhard, and the coup\u00e9 raced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down\nhis face.\n\"The God damned coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn't even stop his car.\"",

            "text": "The Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark\nrustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the\nsecond floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n\"Daisy's home,\" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\nfrowned slightly.\n\"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can\ndo tonight.\"\nA change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\n\"I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting\nyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some\nsupper\u2014if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\"\n\"No, thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait\noutside.\"\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n\"Won't you come in, Nick?\"\n\"No, thanks.\"\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan\nlingered for a moment more.\n\"It's only half-past nine,\" she said.\nI'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day,\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\nthis in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from\nthe house, intending to wait by the gate.\nI hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped\nfrom between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird\nby that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity\nof his pink suit under the moon.\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was\ngoing to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to\nsee sinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfshiem's people,\" behind him in\nthe dark shrubbery.\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\n\"Yes.\"\nHe hesitated.\n\"Was she killed?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\nHe spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in\nmy garage. I don't think anybody saw us, but of course I can't be\nsure.\"\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to\ntell him he was wrong.\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did\nit happen?\"\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel\u2014\" He broke off, and suddenly I\nguessed at the truth.\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I'll say I was. You see,\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\nsteady her to drive\u2014and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but\nit seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were\nsomebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward\nthe other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second\nmy hand reached the wheel I felt the shock\u2014it must have killed her\ninstantly.\"\n\"It ripped her open\u2014\"\n\"Don't tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow\u2014Daisy stepped on it. I\ntried to make her stop, but she couldn't, so I pulled on the emergency\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n\"She'll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I'm just going to\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\nthis afternoon. She's locked herself into her room, and if he tries\nany brutality she's going to turn the light out and on again.\"\n\"He won't touch her,\" I said. \"He's not thinking about her.\"\n\"I don't trust him, old sport.\"\n\"How long are you going to wait?\"\n\"All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.\"\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy\nhad been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it\u2014he might\nthink anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright\nwindows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the ground\nfloor.\n\"You wait here,\" I said. \"I'll see if there's any sign of a\ncommotion.\"\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel\nsoftly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains\nwere open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where\nwe had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small\nrectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind\nwas drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\nThey weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\nale\u2014and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\nof natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said\nthat they were conspiring together.",

You must\nhave gone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen,\nGeorge, listen to me. Didn't you get married in a church?\"\n\"That was a long time ago.\"\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking\u2014for a moment\nhe was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came\nback into his faded eyes.\n\"Look in the drawer there,\" he said, pointing at the desk.\n\"Which drawer?\"\n\"That drawer\u2014that one.\"\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it\nbut a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided\nsilver.

But conceivably\nWilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,\nbecause he began saying \"Oh, my God!\" again in a whisper\u2014his comforter\nleft several explanations in the air.\n\"Then he killed her,\" said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.\n\"Who did?\"\n\"I have a way of finding out.\"\n\"You're morbid, George,\" said his friend. \"This has been a strain to\nyou and you don't know what you're saying.

He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had\namused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to\npump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be\ntaken out under any circumstances\u2014and this was strange, because the\nfront right fender needed repair.\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\nthe yellowing trees.\nNo telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep\nand waited for it until four o'clock\u2014until long after there was anyone\nto give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't\nbelieve it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was\ntrue he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a\nhigh price for living too long with a single dream. He must have\nlooked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered\nas he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight\nwas upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without\nbeing real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\nfortuitously about \u2026 like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\nhim through the amorphous trees.\nThe chauffeur\u2014he was one of Wolfshiem's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\u2014heard the\nshots\u2014afterwards he could only say that he hadn't thought anything\nmuch about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house\nand my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that\nalarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a\nword said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried\ndown to the pool.\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\nfresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\nWith little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\nmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\nscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\ncourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\nrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red\ncircle in the water.\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\nsaw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was\ncomplete.",

A rope stretched\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the\npool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\nexpression \"madman\" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\nreports next morning.\nMost of those reports were a nightmare\u2014grotesque, circumstantial,\neager, and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought\nto light Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale\nwould shortly be served up in racy pasquinade\u2014but Catherine, who might\nhave said anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount\nof character about it too\u2014looked at the coroner with determined eyes\nunder that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never\nseen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,\nthat her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced\nherself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very\nsuggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a\nman \"deranged by grief\" in order that the case might remain in its\nsimplest form. And it rested there.\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself\non Gatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the\ncatastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every\npractical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or\nspeak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because\nno one else was interested\u2014interested, I mean, with that intense\npersonal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\n\"Left no address?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Say when they'd be back?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?\"\n\"I don't know. Can't say.\"\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where\nhe lay and reassure him: \"I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't\nworry. Just trust me and I'll get somebody for you\u2014\"\nMeyer Wolfshiem's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me\nhis office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the\ntime I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the\nphone.\n\"Will you ring again?\"\n\"I've rung three times.\"\n\"It's very important.\"\n\"Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there.\"\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they\nwere chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled\nit. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with\nshocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n\"Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got\nto try hard. I can't go through this alone.\"\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going\nupstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk\u2014he'd\nnever told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was\nnothing\u2014only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,\nstaring down from the wall.\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure\nhe'd start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a\nwire from Daisy before noon\u2014but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem\narrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and",

It said only that the sender was\nleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\nIt was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed,\nbundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His\neyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and\numbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse\ngrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat.

He had reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\nfirst time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be\nmixed with an awed pride.

In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the\ndoorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking\nin a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered\nme a cigar.\n\"My memory goes back to when first I met him,\" he said. \"A young major\njust out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.\nHe was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he\ncouldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he\ncame into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a\njob. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on have some\nlunch with me,' I said. He ate more than four dollars' worth of food\nin half an hour.\"\n\"Did you start him in business?\" I inquired.\n\"Start him! I made him.\"\n\"Oh.\"\n\"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\naway he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\nme he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join\nthe American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did\nsome work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like\nthat in everything\"\u2014he held up two bulbous fingers\u2014\"always together.\"\nI wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series\ntransaction in 1919.\n\"Now he's dead,\" I said after a moment. \"You were his closest friend,\nso I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.\"\n\"I'd like to come.\"\n\"Well, come then.\"\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head\nhis eyes filled with tears.\n\"I can't do it\u2014I can't get mixed up in it,\" he said.\n\"There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now.\"\n\"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any\nway. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different\u2014if a friend\nof mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may\nthink that's sentimental, but I mean it\u2014to the bitter end.\"\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\nso I stood up.\n\"Are you a college man?\" he inquired suddenly.\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a \"gonnegtion,\" but he\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\n\"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and\nnot after he is dead,\" he suggested. \"After that my own rule is to let\neverything alone.\"",

Then he returned the wallet and\npulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong\nCassidy.\n\"Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows\nyou.\"\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On\nthe last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September\n12, 1906. And underneath:\nRise from bed 6:00 a.m.\nDumbell exercise and wall-scaling 6:15-6:30 \"\nStudy electricity, etc. 7:15-8:15 \"\nWork 8:30-4:30 p.m.\nBaseball and sports 4:30-5:00 \"\nPractise elocution, poise and how to attain it 5:00-6:00 \"\nStudy needed inventions 7:00-9:00 \"\nGeneral Resolves\n* No wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]\n* No more smokeing or chewing.\n* Bath every other day\n* Read one improving book or magazine per week\n* Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week\n* Be better to parents\n\"I came across this book by accident,\" said the old man. \"It just\nshows you, don't it?\"\n\"It just shows you.\"\n\"Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this\nor something. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He\nwas always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat\nhim for it.\"\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then\nlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the\nlist for my own use.",

And as the time passed and the servants came in and\nstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he\nspoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait\nfor half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery\nand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate\u2014first a motor hearse,\nhorribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in the\nlimousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman\nfrom West Egg, in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we\nstarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then\nthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I\nlooked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found\nmarvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\nI'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the\nfuneral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\nfrom Gatsby's grave.\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already\ntoo far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that\nDaisy hadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\n\"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\" and then the owl-eyed\nman said \"Amen to that,\" in a brave voice.\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke\nto me by the gate.\n\"I couldn't get to the house,\" he remarked.\n\"Neither could anybody else.\"\n\"Go on!\" He started. \"Why, my God! they used to go there by the\nhundreds.\"\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.\n\"The poor son-of-a-bitch,\" he said.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school",
