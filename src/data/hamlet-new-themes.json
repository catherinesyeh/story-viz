I know you are no truant.\nBut what is your affair in Elsinore?\nWe'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\nHORATIO.\nMy lord, I came to see your father's funeral.\nHAMLET.\nI prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.\nI think it was to see my mother's wedding.\nHORATIO.\nIndeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.\nHAMLET.\nThrift, thrift, Horatio!

This to me\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch,\nWhere, as they had deliver'd, both in time,\nForm of the thing, each word made true and good,\nThe apparition comes. I knew your father;\nThese hands are not more like.\nHAMLET.\nBut where was this?\nMARCELLUS.\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch.\nHAMLET.\nDid you not speak to it?\nHORATIO.\nMy lord, I did;\nBut answer made it none: yet once methought\nIt lifted up it head, and did address\nItself to motion, like as it would speak.\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\nAnd vanish'd from our sight.\nHAMLET.\n'Tis very strange.\nHORATIO.\nAs I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\nTo let you know of it.\nHAMLET.\nIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\nHold you the watch tonight?\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\nWe do, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nArm'd, say you?\nBoth.\nArm'd, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nFrom top to toe?\nBOTH.\nMy lord, from head to foot.\nHAMLET.\nThen saw you not his face?\nHORATIO.\nO yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.\nHAMLET.\nWhat, look'd he frowningly?\nHORATIO.\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\nHAMLET.\nPale, or red?\nHORATIO.\nNay, very pale.\nHAMLET.\nAnd fix'd his eyes upon you?\nHORATIO.\nMost constantly.\nHAMLET.\nI would I had been there.\nHORATIO.\nIt would have much amaz'd you.\nHAMLET.\nVery like, very like. Stay'd it long?\nHORATIO.\nWhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\nLonger, longer.\nHORATIO.\nNot when I saw't.\nHAMLET.\nHis beard was grizzled, no?\nHORATIO.\nIt was, as I have seen it in his life,\nA sable silver'd.\nHAMLET.\nI will watch tonight;\nPerchance 'twill walk again.\nHORATIO.\nI warrant you it will.\nHAMLET.\nIf it assume my noble father's person,\nI'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\nIf you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,\nLet it be tenable in your silence still;\nAnd whatsoever else shall hap tonight,\nGive it an understanding, but no tongue.\nI will requite your loves. So, fare ye well.\nUpon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve,\nI'll visit you.\nALL.\nOur duty to your honour.\nHAMLET.\nYour loves, as mine to you: farewell.\n[_Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo._]\nMy father's spirit in arms!

Perhaps he loves you now,\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\nThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,\nHis greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;\nFor he himself is subject to his birth:\nHe may not, as unvalu'd persons do,\nCarve for himself; for on his choice depends\nThe sanctity and health of this whole state;\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\nWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\nAs he in his particular act and place\nMay give his saying deed; which is no further\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\nThen weigh what loss your honour may sustain\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\nTo his unmaster'd importunity.\nFear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.\nVirtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\nToo oft before their buttons be disclos'd,\nAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\nBe wary then, best safety lies in fear.\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\nOPHELIA.\nI shall th'effect of this good lesson keep\nAs watchman to my heart. But good my brother,\nDo not as some ungracious pastors do,\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven;\nWhilst like a puff'd and reckless libertine\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads,\nAnd recks not his own rede.\nLAERTES.\nO, fear me not.\nI stay too long. But here my father comes.\nEnter Polonius.\nA double blessing is a double grace;\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\nPOLONIUS.\nYet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame.\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\nAnd you are stay'd for. There, my blessing with you.\n[_Laying his hand on Laertes's head._]\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\nLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\nNor any unproportion'd thought his act.\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\nGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\nOf each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware\nOf entrance to a quarrel; but being in,\nBear't that th'opposed may beware of thee.\nGive every man thine ear, but few thy voice:\nTake each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement.\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\nBut not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man;\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be:\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend;\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\nThis above all: to thine own self be true;\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\nFarewell: my blessing season this in thee.\nLAERTES.\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\nPOLONIUS.\nThe time invites you; go, your servants tend.\nLAERTES.\nFarewell, Ophelia, and remember well\nWhat I have said to you.\nOPHELIA.\n'Tis in my memory lock'd,\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\nLAERTES.\nFarewell.\n[_Exit._]\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\nOPHELIA.\nSo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.\nPOLONIUS.\nMarry, well bethought:\n'Tis told me he hath very oft of late\nGiven private time to you; and you yourself\nHave of your audience been most free and bounteous.\nIf it be so,\u2014as so 'tis put on me,\nAnd that in way of caution,\u2014I must tell you\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\nAs it behoves my daughter and your honour.\nWhat is between you?

Tender yourself more dearly;\nOr,\u2014not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\nRunning it thus,\u2014you'll tender me a fool.\nOPHELIA.\nMy lord, he hath importun'd me with love\nIn honourable fashion.\nPOLONIUS.\nAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\nOPHELIA.\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\nPOLONIUS.\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\nLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,\nGiving more light than heat, extinct in both,\nEven in their promise, as it is a-making,\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence;\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\nThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\nBelieve so much in him that he is young;\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\nThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,\nDo not believe his vows; for they are brokers,\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\nThe better to beguile. This is for all:\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\nLook to't, I charge you; come your ways.\nOPHELIA.\nI shall obey, my lord.\n[_Exeunt._]",

List, list, O, list!\nIf thou didst ever thy dear father love\u2014\nHAMLET.\nO God!\nGHOST.\nRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\nHAMLET.\nMurder!\nGHOST.\nMurder most foul, as in the best it is;\nBut this most foul, strange, and unnatural.\nHAMLET.\nHaste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift\nAs meditation or the thoughts of love\nMay sweep to my revenge.\nGHOST.\nI find thee apt;\nAnd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\nThat rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\nWouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.\n'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\nA serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark\nIs by a forged process of my death\nRankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,\nThe serpent that did sting thy father's life\nNow wears his crown.\nHAMLET.\nO my prophetic soul!\nMine uncle!\nGHOST.\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\nWith witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,\u2014\nO wicked wit, and gifts, that have the power\nSo to seduce!\u2014won to his shameful lust\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.\nO Hamlet, what a falling off was there,\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\nI made to her in marriage; and to decline\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\nTo those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;\nSo lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed\nAnd prey on garbage.\nBut soft! methinks I scent the morning air;\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole\nWith juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\nThe leperous distilment, whose effect\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body;\nAnd with a sudden vigour it doth posset\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\nThe thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;\nAnd a most instant tetter bark'd about,\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\nAll my smooth body.\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,\nOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatch'd:\nCut off even in the blossoms of my sin,\nUnhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;\nNo reckoning made, but sent to my account\nWith all my imperfections on my head.\nO horrible! O horrible! most horrible!\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\nBut howsoever thou pursu'st this act,\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\nAgainst thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!\nThe glow-worm shows the matin to be near,\nAnd 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.\nAdieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.\n[_Exit._]\nHAMLET.\nO all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?\nAnd shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart;\nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\nBut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?\nAy, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat\nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee?\nYea, from the table of my memory\nI'll wipe away all trivial fond records,\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\nThat youth and observation copied there;\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\nUnmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!\nO most pernicious woman!\nO villain, villain, smiling damned villain!\nMy tables. Meet it is I set it down,\nThat one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!\nAt least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.\n[_Writing._]\nSo, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;\nIt is 'Adieu, adieu, remember me.'\nI have sworn't.\nHORATIO and MARCELLUS.\n[_Within._] My lord, my lord.\nMARCELLUS.\n[_Within._] Lord Hamlet.\nHORATIO.\n[_Within._] Heaven secure him.\nHAMLET.\nSo be it!\nMARCELLUS.\n[_Within._] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!\nHAMLET.\nHillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\nMARCELLUS.\nHow is't, my noble lord?\nHORATIO.\nWhat news, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nO, wonderful!\nHORATIO.\nGood my lord, tell it.\nHAMLET.\nNo, you'll reveal it.\nHORATIO.\nNot I, my lord, by heaven.\nMARCELLUS.\nNor I, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nHow say you then, would heart of man once think it?\u2014\nBut you'll be secret?\nHORATIO and MARCELLUS.\nAy, by heaven, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nThere's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark\nBut he's an arrant knave.\nHORATIO.\nThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\nTo tell us this.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, right; you are i' the right;\nAnd so, without more circumstance at all,\nI hold it fit that we shake hands and part:\nYou, as your business and desire shall point you,\u2014\nFor every man hath business and desire,\nSuch as it is;\u2014and for my own poor part,\nLook you, I'll go pray.\nHORATIO.\nThese are but wild and whirling words, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI'm sorry they offend you, heartily;\nYes faith, heartily.\nHORATIO.\nThere's no offence, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nYes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,\nAnd much offence too. Touching this vision here,\nIt is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.\nFor your desire to know what is between us,\nO'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,\nAs you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,\nGive me one poor request.\nHORATIO.\nWhat is't, my lord? We will.\nHAMLET.\nNever make known what you have seen tonight.\nHORATIO and MARCELLUS.\nMy lord, we will not.\nHAMLET.\nNay, but swear't.\nHORATIO.\nIn faith, my lord, not I.\nMARCELLUS.\nNor I, my lord, in faith.\nHAMLET.\nUpon my sword.\nMARCELLUS.\nWe have sworn, my lord, already.\nHAMLET.\nIndeed, upon my sword, indeed.\nGHOST.\n[_Cries under the stage._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\nHa, ha boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?\nCome on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.\nConsent to swear.\nHORATIO.\nPropose the oath, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nNever to speak of this that you have seen.\nSwear by my sword.\nGHOST.\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\n_Hic et ubique?_ Then we'll shift our ground.\nCome hither, gentlemen,\nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword.\nNever to speak of this that you have heard.\nSwear by my sword.\nGHOST.\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\nWell said, old mole! Canst work i' th'earth so fast?\nA worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.\nHORATIO.\nO day and night, but this is wondrous strange.\nHAMLET.\nAnd therefore as a stranger give it welcome.\nThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come,\nHere, as before, never, so help you mercy,\nHow strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,\u2014\nAs I perchance hereafter shall think meet\nTo put an antic disposition on\u2014\nThat you, at such times seeing me, never shall,\nWith arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,\nOr by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,\nAs 'Well, we know', or 'We could and if we would',\nOr 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be and if they might',\nOr such ambiguous giving out, to note\nThat you know aught of me:\u2014this not to do.\nSo grace and mercy at your most need help you,\nSwear.\nGHOST.\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\nRest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen,\nWith all my love I do commend me to you;\nAnd what so poor a man as Hamlet is\nMay do t'express his love and friending to you,\nGod willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,\nAnd still your fingers on your lips, I pray.\nThe time is out of joint. O cursed spite,\nThat ever I was born to set it right.\nNay, come, let's go together.\n[_Exeunt._]",

Long stay'd he so,\nAt last,\u2014a little shaking of mine arm,\nAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,\nHe rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound\nAs it did seem to shatter all his bulk\nAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,\nAnd with his head over his shoulder turn'd\nHe seem'd to find his way without his eyes,\nFor out o' doors he went without their help,\nAnd to the last bended their light on me.\nPOLONIUS.\nCome, go with me. I will go seek the King.\nThis is the very ecstasy of love,\nWhose violent property fordoes itself,\nAnd leads the will to desperate undertakings,\nAs oft as any passion under heaven\nThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry,\u2014\nWhat, have you given him any hard words of late?\nOPHELIA.\nNo, my good lord; but as you did command,\nI did repel his letters and denied\nHis access to me.\nPOLONIUS.\nThat hath made him mad.\nI am sorry that with better heed and judgement\nI had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle,\nAnd meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy!\nIt seems it is as proper to our age\nTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinions\nAs it is common for the younger sort\nTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.\nThis must be known, which, being kept close, might move\nMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.\n[_Exeunt._]",

That great\nbaby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nHappily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is\ntwice a child.\nHAMLET.\nI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.\u2014You say\nright, sir: for a Monday morning 'twas so indeed.\nPOLONIUS.\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\nHAMLET.\nMy lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome\u2014\nPOLONIUS.\nThe actors are come hither, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nBuzz, buzz.\nPOLONIUS.\nUpon my honour.\nHAMLET.\nThen came each actor on his ass\u2014\nPOLONIUS.\nThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history,\npastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,\ntragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem\nunlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the\nlaw of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.\nHAMLET.\nO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat treasure had he, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nWhy\u2014\n'One fair daughter, and no more,\nThe which he loved passing well.'\nPOLONIUS.\n[_Aside._] Still on my daughter.\nHAMLET.\nAm I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?\nPOLONIUS.\nIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing\nwell.\nHAMLET.\nNay, that follows not.\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat follows then, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nWhy,\nAs by lot, God wot,\nand then, you know,\nIt came to pass, as most like it was.\nThe first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where\nmy abridgement comes.\nEnter four or five Players.\nYou are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well.\nWelcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc'd since I\nsaw thee last. Com'st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady\nand mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I\nsaw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a\npiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you\nare all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at anything\nwe see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your\nquality. Come, a passionate speech.\nFIRST PLAYER.\nWhat speech, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nI heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it\nwas, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million,\n'twas caviare to the general. But it was\u2014as I received it, and others,\nwhose judgements in such matters cried in the top of mine\u2014an excellent\nplay, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as\ncunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make\nthe matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the\nauthor of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as\nsweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I\nchiefly loved. 'Twas Aeneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it\nespecially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in your\nmemory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see:\n_The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,\u2014_\nIt is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus\u2014\n_The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble\nWhen he lay couched in the ominous horse,\nHath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\nWith heraldry more dismal. Head to foot\nNow is he total gules, horridly trick'd\nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\nBak'd and impasted with the parching streets,\nThat lend a tyrannous and a damned light\nTo their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,\nAnd thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,\nWith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\nOld grandsire Priam seeks._\nSo, proceed you.\nPOLONIUS.\n'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.\nFIRST PLAYER.\n_Anon he finds him,\nStriking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,\nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\nRepugnant to command. Unequal match'd,\nPyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\nTh'unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo, his sword,\nWhich was declining on the milky head\nOf reverend Priam, seem'd i' th'air to stick.\nSo, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\nAnd like a neutral to his will and matter,\nDid nothing.\nBut as we often see against some storm,\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\nThe bold winds speechless, and the orb below\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\nDoth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus' pause,\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work,\nAnd never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\nOn Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\nNow falls on Priam.\nOut, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,\nIn general synod, take away her power;\nBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\nAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\nAs low as to the fiends._\nPOLONIUS.\nThis is too long.\nHAMLET.\nIt shall to the barber's, with your beard.\u2014Prithee say on.\nHe's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.\nSay on; come to Hecuba.\nFIRST PLAYER.\n_But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,\u2014_\nHAMLET.\n'The mobled queen'?\nPOLONIUS.\nThat's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.\nFIRST PLAYER.\n_Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames\nWith bisson rheum. A clout upon that head\nWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\nAbout her lank and all o'erteemed loins,\nA blanket, in th'alarm of fear caught up\u2014\nWho this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,\n'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.\nBut if the gods themselves did see her then,\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\nIn mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\nThe instant burst of clamour that she made,\u2014\nUnless things mortal move them not at all,\u2014\nWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\nAnd passion in the gods._\nPOLONIUS.\nLook, where he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's eyes. Pray\nyou, no more.\nHAMLET.\n'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.\u2014Good my\nlord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be\nwell used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time.\nAfter your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill\nreport while you live.\nPOLONIUS.\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\nHAMLET.\nGod's bodikin, man, much better. Use every man after his desert, and who\nshould 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. The\nless they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.\nPOLONIUS.\nCome, sirs.\nHAMLET.\nFollow him, friends. We'll hear a play tomorrow.\n[_Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First._]\nDost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play _The Murder of Gonzago_?\nFIRST PLAYER.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWe'll ha't tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some\ndozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in't, could\nyou not?\nFIRST PLAYER.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nVery well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.\n[_Exit First Player._]\n[_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern_] My good friends, I'll leave you\ntill night. You are welcome to Elsinore.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nGood my lord.\n[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]\nHAMLET.\nAy, so, God b' wi' ye. Now I am alone.\nO what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\nThat from her working all his visage wan'd;\nTears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\nFor Hecuba?\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech;\nMake mad the guilty, and appal the free,\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\nAnd can say nothing. No, not for a king\nUpon whose property and most dear life\nA damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?\nWho calls me villain, breaks my pate across?\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\nTweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i' th' throat\nAs deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?\nHa! 'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\nBut I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall\nTo make oppression bitter, or ere this\nI should have fatted all the region kites\nWith this slave's offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\nOh vengeance!\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\nThat I, the son of a dear father murder'd,\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words\nAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,\nA scullion! Fie upon't! Foh!\nAbout, my brain! I have heard\nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play,\nHave by the very cunning of the scene,\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\nThey have proclaim'd their malefactions.\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\nWith most miraculous organ. I'll have these players\nPlay something like the murder of my father\nBefore mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;\nI'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\nMay be the devil, and the devil hath power\nT'assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\nAbuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds\nMore relative than this. The play's the thing\nWherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.",

This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives\nit proof. I did love you once.\nOPHELIA.\nIndeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\nHAMLET.\nYou should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old\nstock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.\nOPHELIA.\nI was the more deceived.\nHAMLET.\nGet thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am\nmyself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things\nthat it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud,\nrevengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have\nthoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act\nthem in.

[_To Polonius._] My lord, you play'd once i'\nth'university, you say?\nPOLONIUS.\nThat did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.\nHAMLET.\nWhat did you enact?\nPOLONIUS.\nI did enact Julius Caesar. I was kill'd i' th' Capitol. Brutus killed\nme.\nHAMLET.\nIt was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the\nplayers ready?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nAy, my lord; they stay upon your patience.\nQUEEN.\nCome hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.\nHAMLET.\nNo, good mother, here's metal more attractive.\nPOLONIUS.\n[_To the King._] O ho! do you mark that?\nHAMLET.\nLady, shall I lie in your lap?\n[_Lying down at Ophelia's feet._]\nOPHELIA.\nNo, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI mean, my head upon your lap?\nOPHELIA.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nDo you think I meant country matters?\nOPHELIA.\nI think nothing, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nThat's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.\nOPHELIA.\nWhat is, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nNothing.\nOPHELIA.\nYou are merry, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWho, I?\nOPHELIA.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nO God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry? For look\nyou how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within's two\nhours.\nOPHELIA.\nNay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nSo long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of\nsables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then\nthere's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year. But\nby'r lady, he must build churches then; or else shall he suffer not\nthinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for O, the\nhobby-horse is forgot!'\nTrumpets sound. The dumb show enters.\n_Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and he\nher. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her\nup, and declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank of\nflowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow,\ntakes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King's ears, and\nexits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate\naction. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,\nseeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner\nwoos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and unwilling awhile, but in\nthe end accepts his love._\n[_Exeunt._]\nOPHELIA.\nWhat means this, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nMarry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.\nOPHELIA.\nBelike this show imports the argument of the play.\nEnter Prologue.\nHAMLET.\nWe shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they'll\ntell all.\nOPHELIA.\nWill they tell us what this show meant?\nHAMLET.\nAy, or any show that you'll show him.

You are my mother.\nQUEEN.\nNay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.\nHAMLET.\nCome, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.\nYou go not till I set you up a glass\nWhere you may see the inmost part of you.\nQUEEN.\nWhat wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?\nHelp, help, ho!\nPOLONIUS.\n[_Behind._] What, ho! help, help, help!\nHAMLET.\nHow now? A rat? [_Draws._]\nDead for a ducat, dead!\n[_Makes a pass through the arras._]\nPOLONIUS.\n[_Behind._] O, I am slain!\n[_Falls and dies._]\nQUEEN.\nO me, what hast thou done?\nHAMLET.\nNay, I know not. Is it the King?\n[_Draws forth Polonius._]\nQUEEN.\nO what a rash and bloody deed is this!\nHAMLET.\nA bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother,\nAs kill a king and marry with his brother.\nQUEEN.\nAs kill a king?\nHAMLET.\nAy, lady, 'twas my word.\u2014\n[_To Polonius._] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!\nI took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,\nThou find'st to be too busy is some danger.\u2014\nLeave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,\nAnd let me wring your heart, for so I shall,\nIf it be made of penetrable stuff;\nIf damned custom have not braz'd it so,\nThat it is proof and bulwark against sense.\nQUEEN.\nWhat have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue\nIn noise so rude against me?\nHAMLET.\nSuch an act\nThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,\nCalls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love,\nAnd sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows\nAs false as dicers' oaths. O such a deed\nAs from the body of contraction plucks\nThe very soul, and sweet religion makes\nA rhapsody of words. Heaven's face doth glow,\nYea this solidity and compound mass,\nWith tristful visage, as against the doom,\nIs thought-sick at the act.\nQUEEN.\nAy me, what act,\nThat roars so loud, and thunders in the index?\nHAMLET.\nLook here upon this picture, and on this,\nThe counterfeit presentment of two brothers.\nSee what a grace was seated on this brow,\nHyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself,\nAn eye like Mars, to threaten and command,\nA station like the herald Mercury\nNew lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:\nA combination and a form indeed,\nWhere every god did seem to set his seal,\nTo give the world assurance of a man.\nThis was your husband. Look you now what follows.\nHere is your husband, like a mildew'd ear\nBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?\nCould you on this fair mountain leave to feed,\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?\nYou cannot call it love; for at your age\nThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,\nAnd waits upon the judgement: and what judgement\nWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,\nElse could you not have motion; but sure that sense\nIs apoplex'd, for madness would not err\nNor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd\nBut it reserv'd some quantity of choice\nTo serve in such a difference. What devil was't\nThat thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?\nEyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\nEars without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\nOr but a sickly part of one true sense\nCould not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?\nRebellious hell,\nIf thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,\nTo flaming youth let virtue be as wax,\nAnd melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame\nWhen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,\nSince frost itself as actively doth burn,\nAnd reason panders will.\nQUEEN.\nO Hamlet, speak no more.\nThou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,\nAnd there I see such black and grained spots\nAs will not leave their tinct.\nHAMLET.\nNay, but to live\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\nStew'd in corruption, honeying and making love\nOver the nasty sty.\nQUEEN.\nO speak to me no more;\nThese words like daggers enter in mine ears;\nNo more, sweet Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nA murderer and a villain;\nA slave that is not twentieth part the tithe\nOf your precedent lord. A vice of kings,\nA cutpurse of the empire and the rule,\nThat from a shelf the precious diadem stole\nAnd put it in his pocket!\nQUEEN.\nNo more.\nHAMLET.\nA king of shreds and patches!\u2014\nEnter Ghost.\nSave me and hover o'er me with your wings,\nYou heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?\nQUEEN.\nAlas, he's mad.\nHAMLET.\nDo you not come your tardy son to chide,\nThat, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by\nThe important acting of your dread command?\nO say!\nGHOST.\nDo not forget. This visitation\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\nBut look, amazement on thy mother sits.\nO step between her and her fighting soul.\nConceit in weakest bodies strongest works.\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nHow is it with you, lady?\nQUEEN.\nAlas, how is't with you,\nThat you do bend your eye on vacancy,\nAnd with the incorporal air do hold discourse?\nForth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,\nYour bedded hairs, like life in excrements,\nStart up and stand an end. O gentle son,\nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper\nSprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?\nHAMLET.\nOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,\nHis form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,\nWould make them capable.\u2014Do not look upon me,\nLest with this piteous action you convert\nMy stern effects. Then what I have to do\nWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.\nQUEEN.\nTo whom do you speak this?\nHAMLET.\nDo you see nothing there?\nQUEEN.\nNothing at all; yet all that is I see.\nHAMLET.\nNor did you nothing hear?\nQUEEN.\nNo, nothing but ourselves.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, look you there! look how it steals away!\nMy father, in his habit as he liv'd!\nLook where he goes even now out at the portal.\n[_Exit Ghost._]\nQUEEN.\nThis is the very coinage of your brain.\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\nIs very cunning in.\nHAMLET.\nEcstasy!\nMy pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,\nAnd makes as healthful music. It is not madness\nThat I have utter'd. Bring me to the test,\nAnd I the matter will re-word; which madness\nWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,\nLay not that flattering unction to your soul\nThat not your trespass, but my madness speaks.\nIt will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\nWhilst rank corruption, mining all within,\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,\nRepent what's past, avoid what is to come;\nAnd do not spread the compost on the weeds,\nTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;\nFor in the fatness of these pursy times\nVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,\nYea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\nQUEEN.\nO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.\nHAMLET.\nO throw away the worser part of it,\nAnd live the purer with the other half.\nGood night. But go not to mine uncle's bed.\nAssume a virtue, if you have it not.\nThat monster custom, who all sense doth eat,\nOf habits evil, is angel yet in this,\nThat to the use of actions fair and good\nHe likewise gives a frock or livery\nThat aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,\nAnd that shall lend a kind of easiness\nTo the next abstinence. The next more easy;\nFor use almost can change the stamp of nature,\nAnd either curb the devil, or throw him out\nWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night,\nAnd when you are desirous to be bles'd,\nI'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord\n[_Pointing to Polonius._]\nI do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,\nTo punish me with this, and this with me,\nThat I must be their scourge and minister.\nI will bestow him, and will answer well\nThe death I gave him. So again, good night.\nI must be cruel, only to be kind:\nThus bad begins, and worse remains behind.\nOne word more, good lady.\nQUEEN.\nWhat shall I do?\nHAMLET.\nNot this, by no means, that I bid you do:\nLet the bloat King tempt you again to bed,\nPinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,\nAnd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,\nOr paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,\nMake you to ravel all this matter out,\nThat I essentially am not in madness,\nBut mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,\nFor who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\nWould from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\nSuch dear concernings hide? Who would do so?\nNo, in despite of sense and secrecy,\nUnpeg the basket on the house's top,\nLet the birds fly, and like the famous ape,\nTo try conclusions, in the basket creep\nAnd break your own neck down.\nQUEEN.\nBe thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,\nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe\nWhat thou hast said to me.\nHAMLET.\nI must to England, you know that?\nQUEEN.\nAlack,\nI had forgot. 'Tis so concluded on.\nHAMLET.\nThere's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,\nWhom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,\u2014\nThey bear the mandate, they must sweep my way\nAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work;\nFor 'tis the sport to have the enginer\nHoist with his own petard, and 't shall go hard\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\nAnd blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet,\nWhen in one line two crafts directly meet.\nThis man shall set me packing.\nI'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.\nMother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor\nIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,\nWho was in life a foolish prating knave.\nCome, sir, to draw toward an end with you.\nGood night, mother.\n[_Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius._]",

Besides, to be demanded\nof a sponge\u2014what replication should be made by the son of a king?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nTake you me for a sponge, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nAy, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards, his\nauthorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end: he\nkeeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be\nlast swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but\nsqueezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nI understand you not, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nMy lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.\nHAMLET.\nThe body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King\nis a thing\u2014\nGUILDENSTERN.\nA thing, my lord!\nHAMLET.\nOf nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.\n[_Exeunt._]\nSCENE III. Another room in the Castle.\nEnter King, attended.\nKING.\nI have sent to seek him and to find the body.\nHow dangerous is it that this man goes loose!\nYet must not we put the strong law on him:\nHe's lov'd of the distracted multitude,\nWho like not in their judgement, but their eyes;\nAnd where 'tis so, th'offender's scourge is weigh'd,\nBut never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,\nThis sudden sending him away must seem\nDeliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown\nBy desperate appliance are reliev'd,\nOr not at all.\nEnter Rosencrantz.\nHow now? What hath befall'n?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nWhere the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,\nWe cannot get from him.\nKING.\nBut where is he?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nWithout, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure.\nKING.\nBring him before us.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nHo, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.\nEnter Hamlet and Guildenstern.\nKING.\nNow, Hamlet, where's Polonius?\nHAMLET.\nAt supper.\nKING.\nAt supper? Where?\nHAMLET.\nNot where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of\npolitic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet.\nWe fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots.\nYour fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service,\u2014two dishes,\nbut to one table. That's the end.\nKING.\nAlas, alas!\nHAMLET.\nA man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the\nfish that hath fed of that worm.\nKING.\nWhat dost thou mean by this?\nHAMLET.\nNothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts\nof a beggar.\nKING.\nWhere is Polonius?\nHAMLET.\nIn heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there,\nseek him i' th'other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not\nwithin this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the\nlobby.\nKING.\n[_To some Attendants._] Go seek him there.\nHAMLET.\nHe will stay till you come.\n[_Exeunt Attendants._]\nKING.\nHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,\u2014\nWhich we do tender, as we dearly grieve\nFor that which thou hast done,\u2014must send thee hence\nWith fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself;\nThe bark is ready, and the wind at help,\nTh'associates tend, and everything is bent\nFor England.\nHAMLET.\nFor England?\nKING.\nAy, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nGood.\nKING.\nSo is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.\nHAMLET.\nI see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear\nmother.\nKING.\nThy loving father, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nMy mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one\nflesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England.\n[_Exit._]\nKING.\nFollow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard;\nDelay it not; I'll have him hence tonight.\nAway, for everything is seal'd and done\nThat else leans on th'affair. Pray you make haste.\n[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]\nAnd England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,\u2014\nAs my great power thereof may give thee sense,\nSince yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red\nAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awe\nPays homage to us,\u2014thou mayst not coldly set\nOur sovereign process, which imports at full,\nBy letters conjuring to that effect,\nThe present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;\nFor like the hectic in my blood he rages,\nAnd thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,\nHowe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.\n[_Exit._]\nSCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.\nEnter Fortinbras and Forces marching.\nFORTINBRAS.\nGo, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.\nTell him that by his license, Fortinbras\nCraves the conveyance of a promis'd march\nOver his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.\nIf that his Majesty would aught with us,\nWe shall express our duty in his eye;\nAnd let him know so.\nCAPTAIN.\nI will do't, my lord.\nFORTINBRAS.\nGo softly on.\n[_Exeunt all but the Captain._]\nEnter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern &c.\nHAMLET.\nGood sir, whose powers are these?\nCAPTAIN.\nThey are of Norway, sir.\nHAMLET.\nHow purpos'd, sir, I pray you?\nCAPTAIN.\nAgainst some part of Poland.\nHAMLET.\nWho commands them, sir?\nCAPTAIN.\nThe nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.\nHAMLET.\nGoes it against the main of Poland, sir,\nOr for some frontier?\nCAPTAIN.\nTruly to speak, and with no addition,\nWe go to gain a little patch of ground\nThat hath in it no profit but the name.\nTo pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;\nNor will it yield to Norway or the Pole\nA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, then the Polack never will defend it.\nCAPTAIN.\nYes, it is already garrison'd.\nHAMLET.\nTwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats\nWill not debate the question of this straw!\nThis is th'imposthume of much wealth and peace,\nThat inward breaks, and shows no cause without\nWhy the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.\nCAPTAIN.\nGod b' wi' you, sir.\n[_Exit._]\nROSENCRANTZ.\nWill't please you go, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nI'll be with you straight. Go a little before.\n[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]\nHow all occasions do inform against me,\nAnd spur my dull revenge. What is a man\nIf his chief good and market of his time\nBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.\nSure he that made us with such large discourse,\nLooking before and after, gave us not\nThat capability and godlike reason\nTo fust in us unus'd. Now whether it be\nBestial oblivion, or some craven scruple\nOf thinking too precisely on th'event,\u2014\nA thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom\nAnd ever three parts coward,\u2014I do not know\nWhy yet I live to say this thing's to do,\nSith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means\nTo do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me,\nWitness this army of such mass and charge,\nLed by a delicate and tender prince,\nWhose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,\nMakes mouths at the invisible event,\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\nEven for an eggshell. Rightly to be great\nIs not to stir without great argument,\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\nWhen honour's at the stake. How stand I then,\nThat have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\nAnd let all sleep, while to my shame I see\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men\nThat, for a fantasy and trick of fame,\nGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plot\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\nTo hide the slain? O, from this time forth,\nMy thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.\n[_Exit._]",

Her speech is nothing,\nYet the unshaped use of it doth move\nThe hearers to collection; they aim at it,\nAnd botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,\nWhich, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,\nIndeed would make one think there might be thought,\nThough nothing sure, yet much unhappily.\n'Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew\nDangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.\nQUEEN.\nLet her come in.\n[_Exit Gentleman._]\nTo my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,\nEach toy seems prologue to some great amiss.\nSo full of artless jealousy is guilt,\nIt spills itself in fearing to be spilt.\nEnter Ophelia.\nOPHELIA.\nWhere is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?\nQUEEN.\nHow now, Ophelia?\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nHow should I your true love know\nFrom another one?\nBy his cockle hat and staff\nAnd his sandal shoon.\nQUEEN.\nAlas, sweet lady, what imports this song?\nOPHELIA.\nSay you? Nay, pray you mark.\n[_Sings._]\nHe is dead and gone, lady,\nHe is dead and gone,\nAt his head a grass green turf,\nAt his heels a stone.\nQUEEN.\nNay, but Ophelia\u2014\nOPHELIA.\nPray you mark.\n[_Sings._]\nWhite his shroud as the mountain snow.\nEnter King.\nQUEEN.\nAlas, look here, my lord!\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nLarded all with sweet flowers;\nWhich bewept to the grave did not go\nWith true-love showers.\nKING.\nHow do you, pretty lady?\nOPHELIA.\nWell, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we\nknow what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!\nKING.\nConceit upon her father.\nOPHELIA.\nPray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it\nmeans, say you this:\n[_Sings._]\nTomorrow is Saint Valentine's day,\nAll in the morning betime,\nAnd I a maid at your window,\nTo be your Valentine.\nThen up he rose and donn'd his clothes,\nAnd dupp'd the chamber door,\nLet in the maid, that out a maid\nNever departed more.\nKING.\nPretty Ophelia!\nOPHELIA.\nIndeed la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't.\n[_Sings._]\nBy Gis and by Saint Charity,\nAlack, and fie for shame!\nYoung men will do't if they come to't;\nBy Cock, they are to blame.\nQuoth she, before you tumbled me,\nYou promis'd me to wed.\nSo would I ha' done, by yonder sun,\nAn thou hadst not come to my bed.\nKING.\nHow long hath she been thus?\nOPHELIA.\nI hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot choose but\nweep, to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground. My brother shall\nknow of it. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach!\nGood night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.\n[_Exit._]\nKING.\nFollow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.\n[_Exit Horatio._]\nO, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs\nAll from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,\nWhen sorrows come, they come not single spies,\nBut in battalions. First, her father slain;\nNext, your son gone; and he most violent author\nOf his own just remove; the people muddied,\nThick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers\nFor good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly\nIn hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia\nDivided from herself and her fair judgement,\nWithout the which we are pictures or mere beasts.\nLast, and as much containing as all these,\nHer brother is in secret come from France,\nFeeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,\nAnd wants not buzzers to infect his ear\nWith pestilent speeches of his father's death,\nWherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,\nWill nothing stick our person to arraign\nIn ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,\nLike to a murdering piece, in many places\nGives me superfluous death.\n[_A noise within._]\nQUEEN.\nAlack, what noise is this?\nKING.\nWhere are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.\nEnter a Gentleman.\nWhat is the matter?\nGENTLEMAN.\nSave yourself, my lord.\nThe ocean, overpeering of his list,\nEats not the flats with more impetuous haste\nThan young Laertes, in a riotous head,\nO'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord,\nAnd, as the world were now but to begin,\nAntiquity forgot, custom not known,\nThe ratifiers and props of every word,\nThey cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'\nCaps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,\n'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.'\nQUEEN.\nHow cheerfully on the false trail they cry.\nO, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.\n[_A noise within._]\nKING.\nThe doors are broke.\nEnter Laertes, armed; Danes following.\nLAERTES.\nWhere is this king?\u2014Sirs, stand you all without.\nDanes.\nNo, let's come in.\nLAERTES.\nI pray you, give me leave.\nDANES.\nWe will, we will.\n[_They retire without the door._]\nLAERTES.\nI thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king,\nGive me my father.\nQUEEN.\nCalmly, good Laertes.\nLAERTES.\nThat drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;\nCries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot\nEven here between the chaste unsmirched brow\nOf my true mother.\nKING.\nWhat is the cause, Laertes,\nThat thy rebellion looks so giant-like?\u2014\nLet him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.\nThere's such divinity doth hedge a king,\nThat treason can but peep to what it would,\nActs little of his will.\u2014Tell me, Laertes,\nWhy thou art thus incens'd.\u2014Let him go, Gertrude:\u2014\nSpeak, man.\nLAERTES.\nWhere is my father?\nKING.\nDead.\nQUEEN.\nBut not by him.\nKING.\nLet him demand his fill.\nLAERTES.\nHow came he dead?

To this point I stand,\nThat both the worlds, I give to negligence,\nLet come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd\nMost throughly for my father.\nKING.\nWho shall stay you?\nLAERTES.\nMy will, not all the world.\nAnd for my means, I'll husband them so well,\nThey shall go far with little.\nKING.\nGood Laertes,\nIf you desire to know the certainty\nOf your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge\nThat, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,\nWinner and loser?\nLAERTES.\nNone but his enemies.\nKING.\nWill you know them then?\nLAERTES.\nTo his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;\nAnd, like the kind life-rendering pelican,\nRepast them with my blood.\nKING.\nWhy, now you speak\nLike a good child and a true gentleman.\nThat I am guiltless of your father's death,\nAnd am most sensibly in grief for it,\nIt shall as level to your judgement 'pear\nAs day does to your eye.\nDANES.\n[_Within._] Let her come in.\nLAERTES.\nHow now! What noise is that?\nRe-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.\nO heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt,\nBurn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.\nBy heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,\nTill our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!\nDear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!\nO heavens, is't possible a young maid's wits\nShould be as mortal as an old man's life?\nNature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,\nIt sends some precious instance of itself\nAfter the thing it loves.\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nThey bore him barefac'd on the bier,\nHey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny\nAnd on his grave rain'd many a tear.\u2014\nFare you well, my dove!\nLAERTES.\nHadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,\nIt could not move thus.\nOPHELIA.\nYou must sing 'Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O, how the\nwheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master's\ndaughter.\nLAERTES.\nThis nothing's more than matter.\nOPHELIA.\nThere's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray love, remember. And\nthere is pansies, that's for thoughts.\nLAERTES.\nA document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.\nOPHELIA.\nThere's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you; and here's\nsome for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays. O you must wear\nyour rue with a difference. There's a daisy. I would give you some\nviolets, but they wither'd all when my father died. They say he made a\ngood end.\n[_Sings._]\nFor bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.\nLAERTES.\nThought and affliction, passion, hell itself\nShe turns to favour and to prettiness.\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nAnd will he not come again?\nAnd will he not come again?\nNo, no, he is dead,\nGo to thy death-bed,\nHe never will come again.\nHis beard was as white as snow,\nAll flaxen was his poll.\nHe is gone, he is gone,\nAnd we cast away moan.\nGod ha' mercy on his soul.\nAnd of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' ye.\n[_Exit._]",

Another room in the Castle.\nEnter Horatio and a Servant.\nHORATIO.\nWhat are they that would speak with me?\nSERVANT.\nSailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.\nHORATIO.\nLet them come in.\n[_Exit Servant._]\nI do not know from what part of the world\nI should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.\nEnter Sailors.\nFIRST SAILOR.\nGod bless you, sir.\nHORATIO.\nLet him bless thee too.\nFIRST SAILOR.\nHe shall, sir, and't please him. There's a letter for you, sir. It\ncomes from th'ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be\nHoratio, as I am let to know it is.\nHORATIO.\n[_Reads._] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these\nfellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we were\ntwo days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us\nchase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled\nvalour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got\nclear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt\nwith me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I am to do\na good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and\nrepair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have\nwords to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too\nlight for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee\nwhere I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England:\nof them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.\nHe that thou knowest thine,\nHAMLET.'\nCome, I will give you way for these your letters,\nAnd do't the speedier, that you may direct me\nTo him from whom you brought them.\n[_Exeunt._]\nSCENE VII. Another room in the Castle.\nEnter King and Laertes.\nKING.\nNow must your conscience my acquittance seal,\nAnd you must put me in your heart for friend,\nSith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\nThat he which hath your noble father slain\nPursu'd my life.\nLAERTES.\nIt well appears. But tell me\nWhy you proceeded not against these feats,\nSo crimeful and so capital in nature,\nAs by your safety, wisdom, all things else,\nYou mainly were stirr'd up.\nKING.\nO, for two special reasons,\nWhich may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,\nBut yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother\nLives almost by his looks; and for myself,\u2014\nMy virtue or my plague, be it either which,\u2014\nShe's so conjunctive to my life and soul,\nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\nI could not but by her. The other motive,\nWhy to a public count I might not go,\nIs the great love the general gender bear him,\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\nWould like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\nConvert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,\nToo slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\nAnd not where I had aim'd them.\nLAERTES.\nAnd so have I a noble father lost,\nA sister driven into desperate terms,\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\nFor her perfections. But my revenge will come.\nKING.\nBreak not your sleeps for that. You must not think\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger,\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.\nI lov'd your father, and we love ourself,\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine\u2014\nEnter a Messenger.\nHow now? What news?\nMESSENGER.\nLetters, my lord, from Hamlet.\nThis to your Majesty; this to the Queen.\nKING.\nFrom Hamlet! Who brought them?\nMESSENGER.\nSailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.\nThey were given me by Claudio. He receiv'd them\nOf him that brought them.\nKING.\nLaertes, you shall hear them.\nLeave us.\n[_Exit Messenger._]\n[_Reads._] 'High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your\nkingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I\nshall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my\nsudden and more strange return.\nHAMLET.'\nWhat should this mean? Are all the rest come back?\nOr is it some abuse, and no such thing?\nLAERTES.\nKnow you the hand?\nKING.\n'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'\nAnd in a postscript here he says 'alone.'\nCan you advise me?\nLAERTES.\nI am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,\nIt warms the very sickness in my heart\nThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth,\n'Thus diest thou.'\nKING.\nIf it be so, Laertes,\u2014\nAs how should it be so? How otherwise?\u2014\nWill you be rul'd by me?\nLAERTES.\nAy, my lord;\nSo you will not o'errule me to a peace.\nKING.\nTo thine own peace. If he be now return'd,\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\nTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\nAnd for his death no wind shall breathe,\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\nAnd call it accident.\nLAERTES.\nMy lord, I will be rul'd;\nThe rather if you could devise it so\nThat I might be the organ.\nKING.\nIt falls right.\nYou have been talk'd of since your travel much,\nAnd that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality\nWherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\nOf the unworthiest siege.\nLAERTES.\nWhat part is that, my lord?\nKING.\nA very riband in the cap of youth,\nYet needful too, for youth no less becomes\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy,\u2014\nI've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,\nAnd they can well on horseback, but this gallant\nHad witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\nAs had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd\nWith the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought\nThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks,\nCome short of what he did.\nLAERTES.\nA Norman was't?\nKING.\nA Norman.\nLAERTES.\nUpon my life, Lamord.\nKING.\nThe very same.\nLAERTES.\nI know him well. He is the brooch indeed\nAnd gem of all the nation.\nKING.\nHe made confession of you,\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\nFor art and exercise in your defence,\nAnd for your rapier most especially,\nThat he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed\nIf one could match you. The scrimers of their nation\nHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\nIf you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\nYour sudden coming o'er to play with him.\nNow, out of this,\u2014\nLAERTES.\nWhat out of this, my lord?\nKING.\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\nA face without a heart?\nLAERTES.\nWhy ask you this?\nKING.\nNot that I think you did not love your father,\nBut that I know love is begun by time,\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\nThere lives within the very flame of love\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still,\nFor goodness, growing to a pleurisy,\nDies in his own too much. That we would do,\nWe should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\nAnd then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th'ulcer:\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake\nTo show yourself your father's son in deed,\nMore than in words?\nLAERTES.\nTo cut his throat i' th' church.\nKING.\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\nRevenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,\nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.\nHamlet return'd shall know you are come home:\nWe'll put on those shall praise your excellence,\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\nThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together\nAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\nWill not peruse the foils; so that with ease,\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,\nRequite him for your father.\nLAERTES.\nI will do't.\nAnd for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.\nI bought an unction of a mountebank\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\nThis is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point\nWith this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,\nIt may be death.\nKING.\nLet's further think of this,\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\nMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance.\n'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project\nShould have a back or second, that might hold\nIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.\nWe'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,\u2014\nI ha't! When in your motion you are hot and dry,\nAs make your bouts more violent to that end,\nAnd that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him\nA chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,\nIf he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,\nOur purpose may hold there.\nEnter Queen.\nHow now, sweet Queen?\nQUEEN.\nOne woe doth tread upon another's heel,\nSo fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.\nLAERTES.\nDrown'd! O, where?\nQUEEN.\nThere is a willow grows aslant a brook,\nThat shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.\nThere with fantastic garlands did she make\nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\nThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\nBut our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.\nThere on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds\nClamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,\nAnd mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,\nWhich time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,\nAs one incapable of her own distress,\nOr like a creature native and indued\nUnto that element. But long it could not be\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\nPull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay\nTo muddy death.\nLAERTES.\nAlas, then she is drown'd?\nQUEEN.\nDrown'd, drown'd.\nLAERTES.\nToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,\nAnd therefore I forbid my tears. But yet\nIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,\nLet shame say what it will. When these are gone,\nThe woman will be out. Adieu, my lord,\nI have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,\nBut that this folly douts it.\n[_Exit._]\nKING.\nLet's follow, Gertrude;\nHow much I had to do to calm his rage!\nNow fear I this will give it start again;\nTherefore let's follow.\n[_Exeunt._]",

Now let me see the other;\nYou do remember all the circumstance?\nHORATIO.\nRemember it, my lord!\nHAMLET.\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\nWorse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,\nAnd prais'd be rashness for it,\u2014let us know,\nOur indiscretion sometime serves us well,\nWhen our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us\nThere's a divinity that shapes our ends,\nRough-hew them how we will.\nHORATIO.\nThat is most certain.\nHAMLET.\nUp from my cabin,\nMy sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark\nGrop'd I to find out them; had my desire,\nFinger'd their packet, and in fine, withdrew\nTo mine own room again, making so bold,\nMy fears forgetting manners, to unseal\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,\nOh royal knavery! an exact command,\nLarded with many several sorts of reasons,\nImporting Denmark's health, and England's too,\nWith ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,\nThat on the supervise, no leisure bated,\nNo, not to stay the grinding of the axe,\nMy head should be struck off.\nHORATIO.\nIs't possible?\nHAMLET.\nHere's the commission, read it at more leisure.\nBut wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?\nHORATIO.\nI beseech you.\nHAMLET.\nBeing thus benetted round with villanies,\u2014\nOr I could make a prologue to my brains,\nThey had begun the play,\u2014I sat me down,\nDevis'd a new commission, wrote it fair:\nI once did hold it, as our statists do,\nA baseness to write fair, and labour'd much\nHow to forget that learning; but, sir, now\nIt did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know\nThe effect of what I wrote?\nHORATIO.\nAy, good my lord.\nHAMLET.\nAn earnest conjuration from the King,\nAs England was his faithful tributary,\nAs love between them like the palm might flourish,\nAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear\nAnd stand a comma 'tween their amities,\nAnd many such-like 'as'es of great charge,\nThat on the view and know of these contents,\nWithout debatement further, more or less,\nHe should the bearers put to sudden death,\nNot shriving-time allow'd.\nHORATIO.\nHow was this seal'd?\nHAMLET.\nWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.\nI had my father's signet in my purse,\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal:\nFolded the writ up in the form of the other,\nSubscrib'd it: gave't th'impression; plac'd it safely,\nThe changeling never known. Now, the next day\nWas our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent\nThou know'st already.\nHORATIO.\nSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, man, they did make love to this employment.\nThey are not near my conscience; their defeat\nDoes by their own insinuation grow.\n'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\nBetween the pass and fell incensed points\nOf mighty opposites.\nHORATIO.\nWhy, what a king is this!\nHAMLET.\nDoes it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon,\u2014\nHe that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother,\nPopp'd in between th'election and my hopes,\nThrown out his angle for my proper life,\nAnd with such cozenage\u2014is't not perfect conscience\nTo quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd\nTo let this canker of our nature come\nIn further evil?\nHORATIO.\nIt must be shortly known to him from England\nWhat is the issue of the business there.\nHAMLET.\nIt will be short. The interim is mine;\nAnd a man's life's no more than to say 'One'.\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,\nThat to Laertes I forgot myself;\nFor by the image of my cause I see\nThe portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.\nBut sure the bravery of his grief did put me\nInto a tow'ring passion.\nHORATIO.\nPeace, who comes here?\nEnter Osric.\nOSRIC.\nYour lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.\nHAMLET.\nI humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?\nHORATIO.\nNo, my good lord.\nHAMLET.\nThy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He hath\nmuch land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib\nshall stand at the king's mess; 'tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious\nin the possession of dirt.\nOSRIC.\nSweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing\nto you from his Majesty.\nHAMLET.\nI will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his\nright use; 'tis for the head.\nOSRIC.\nI thank your lordship, 'tis very hot.\nHAMLET.\nNo, believe me, 'tis very cold, the wind is northerly.\nOSRIC.\nIt is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\nHAMLET.\nMethinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.\nOSRIC.\nExceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,\u2014as 'twere\u2014I cannot tell how.\nBut, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a\ngreat wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,\u2014\nHAMLET.\nI beseech you, remember,\u2014\n[_Hamlet moves him to put on his hat._]\nOSRIC.\nNay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly\ncome to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most\nexcellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed,\nto speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for\nyou shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.\nHAMLET.\nSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to\ndivide him inventorially would dizzy th'arithmetic of memory, and yet\nbut yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of\nextolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of\nsuch dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable\nis his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.\nOSRIC.\nYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\nHAMLET.\nThe concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer\nbreath?\nOSRIC.\nSir?\nHORATIO.\nIs't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't, sir,\nreally.\nHAMLET.\nWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?\nOSRIC.\nOf Laertes?\nHORATIO.\nHis purse is empty already, all's golden words are spent.\nHAMLET.\nOf him, sir.\nOSRIC.\nI know you are not ignorant,\u2014\nHAMLET.\nI would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not much\napprove me. Well, sir?\nOSRIC.\nYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,\u2014\nHAMLET.\nI dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence;\nbut to know a man well were to know himself.\nOSRIC.\nI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him, by them\nin his meed he's unfellowed.\nHAMLET.\nWhat's his weapon?\nOSRIC.\nRapier and dagger.\nHAMLET.\nThat's two of his weapons. But well.\nOSRIC.\nThe King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses, against the\nwhich he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards,\nwith their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages,\nin faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most\ndelicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.\nHAMLET.\nWhat call you the carriages?\nHORATIO.\nI knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.\nOSRIC.\nThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.\nHAMLET.\nThe phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon\nby our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six\nBarbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three\nliberal conceited carriages: that's the French bet against the Danish.\nWhy is this all imponed, as you call it?\nOSRIC.\nThe King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he\nshall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. And\nit would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the\nanswer.\nHAMLET.\nHow if I answer no?\nOSRIC.\nI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\nHAMLET.\nSir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the\nbreathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman\nwilling, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if\nnot, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.\nOSRIC.\nShall I re-deliver you e'en so?\nHAMLET.\nTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\nOSRIC.\nI commend my duty to your lordship.\nHAMLET.\nYours, yours.\n[_Exit Osric._]\nHe does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for's\nturn.\nHORATIO.\nThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\nHAMLET.\nHe did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,\u2014and many\nmore of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,\u2014 only got\nthe tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeasty\ncollection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and\nwinnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are\nout.\nEnter a Lord.\nLORD.\nMy lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings\nback to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your\npleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.\nHAMLET.\nI am constant to my purposes, they follow the King's pleasure. If his\nfitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able\nas now.\nLORD.\nThe King and Queen and all are coming down.\nHAMLET.\nIn happy time.\nLORD.\nThe Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes\nbefore you fall to play.\nHAMLET.\nShe well instructs me.\n[_Exit Lord._]\nHORATIO.\nYou will lose this wager, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual\npractice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill\nall's here about my heart: but it is no matter.\nHORATIO.\nNay, good my lord.\nHAMLET.\nIt is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would\nperhaps trouble a woman.\nHORATIO.\nIf your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair\nhither, and say you are not fit.\nHAMLET.\nNot a whit, we defy augury. There's a special providence in the fall of\na sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it\nwill be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all.\nSince no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?\nEnter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric and Attendants with foils &c.",

I have done you wrong;\nBut pardon't as you are a gentleman.\nThis presence knows, and you must needs have heard,\nHow I am punish'd with sore distraction.\nWhat I have done\nThat might your nature, honour, and exception\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\nWas't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,\nAnd when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,\nThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\nWho does it, then? His madness. If't be so,\nHamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;\nHis madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\nSir, in this audience,\nLet my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts\nThat I have shot my arrow o'er the house\nAnd hurt my brother.\nLAERTES.\nI am satisfied in nature,\nWhose motive in this case should stir me most\nTo my revenge. But in my terms of honour\nI stand aloof, and will no reconcilement\nTill by some elder masters of known honour\nI have a voice and precedent of peace\nTo keep my name ungor'd. But till that time\nI do receive your offer'd love like love,\nAnd will not wrong it.\nHAMLET.\nI embrace it freely,\nAnd will this brother's wager frankly play.\u2014\nGive us the foils; come on.\nLAERTES.\nCome, one for me.\nHAMLET.\nI'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance\nYour skill shall like a star i' th' darkest night,\nStick fiery off indeed.\nLAERTES.\nYou mock me, sir.\nHAMLET.\nNo, by this hand.\nKING.\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\nYou know the wager?\nHAMLET.\nVery well, my lord.\nYour Grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.\nKING.\nI do not fear it. I have seen you both;\nBut since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.\nLAERTES.\nThis is too heavy. Let me see another.\nHAMLET.\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\n[_They prepare to play._]\nOSRIC.\nAy, my good lord.\nKING.\nSet me the stoups of wine upon that table.\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit,\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire;\nThe King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw\nRicher than that which four successive kings\nIn Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;\nAnd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\nThe trumpet to the cannoneer without,\nThe cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,\n'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.\nAnd you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\nHAMLET.\nCome on, sir.\nLAERTES.\nCome, my lord.\n[_They play._]\nHAMLET.\nOne.\nLAERTES.\nNo.\nHAMLET.\nJudgement.\nOSRIC.\nA hit, a very palpable hit.\nLAERTES.\nWell; again.\nKING.\nStay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;\nHere's to thy health.\n[_Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within._]\nGive him the cup.\nHAMLET.\nI'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.\n[_They play._]\nCome. Another hit; what say you?\nLAERTES.\nA touch, a touch, I do confess.\nKING.\nOur son shall win.\nQUEEN.\nHe's fat, and scant of breath.\nHere, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.\nThe Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nGood madam.\nKING.\nGertrude, do not drink.\nQUEEN.\nI will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.\nKING.\n[_Aside._] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.\nHAMLET.\nI dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.\nQUEEN.\nCome, let me wipe thy face.\nLAERTES.\nMy lord, I'll hit him now.\nKING.\nI do not think't.\nLAERTES.\n[_Aside._] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.\nHAMLET.\nCome for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.\nI pray you pass with your best violence.\nI am afeard you make a wanton of me.\nLAERTES.\nSay you so? Come on.\n[_They play._]\nOSRIC.\nNothing neither way.\nLAERTES.\nHave at you now.\n[_Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and\nHamlet wounds Laertes._]\nKING.\nPart them; they are incens'd.\nHAMLET.\nNay, come again!\n[_The Queen falls._]\nOSRIC.\nLook to the Queen there, ho!\nHORATIO.\nThey bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?\nOSRIC.\nHow is't, Laertes?\nLAERTES.\nWhy, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric.\nI am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.\nHAMLET.\nHow does the Queen?\nKING.\nShe swoons to see them bleed.\nQUEEN.\nNo, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!\nThe drink, the drink! I am poison'd.\n[_Dies._]\nHAMLET.\nO villany! Ho! Let the door be lock'd:\nTreachery! Seek it out.\n[_Laertes falls._]\nLAERTES.\nIt is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.\nNo medicine in the world can do thee good.\nIn thee there is not half an hour of life;\nThe treacherous instrument is in thy hand,\nUnbated and envenom'd. The foul practice\nHath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,\nNever to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.\nI can no more. The King, the King's to blame.\nHAMLET.\nThe point envenom'd too!\nThen, venom, to thy work.\n[_Stabs the King._]\nOSRIC and LORDS.\nTreason! treason!\nKING.\nO yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.\nHAMLET.\nHere, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,\nDrink off this potion. Is thy union here?\nFollow my mother.\n[_King dies._]\nLAERTES.\nHe is justly serv'd.\nIt is a poison temper'd by himself.\nExchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.\nMine and my father's death come not upon thee,\nNor thine on me.\n[_Dies._]\nHAMLET.\nHeaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.\nI am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu.\nYou that look pale and tremble at this chance,\nThat are but mutes or audience to this act,\nHad I but time,\u2014as this fell sergeant, death,\nIs strict in his arrest,\u2014O, I could tell you,\u2014\nBut let it be. Horatio, I am dead,\nThou liv'st; report me and my cause aright\nTo the unsatisfied.\nHORATIO.\nNever believe it.\nI am more an antique Roman than a Dane.\nHere's yet some liquor left.\nHAMLET.\nAs th'art a man,\nGive me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I'll have't.\nO good Horatio, what a wounded name,\nThings standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.\nIf thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,\nAbsent thee from felicity awhile,\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,\nTo tell my story.\n[_March afar off, and shot within._]\nWhat warlike noise is this?\nOSRIC.\nYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,\nTo the ambassadors of England gives\nThis warlike volley.\nHAMLET.\nO, I die, Horatio.\nThe potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:\nI cannot live to hear the news from England,\nBut I do prophesy th'election lights\nOn Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.\nSo tell him, with the occurrents more and less,\nWhich have solicited. The rest is silence.\n[_Dies._]\nHORATIO.\nNow cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,\nAnd flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\nWhy does the drum come hither?\n[_March within._]\nEnter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors and others.\nFORTINBRAS.\nWhere is this sight?\nHORATIO.\nWhat is it you would see?\nIf aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.\nFORTINBRAS.\nThis quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,\nWhat feast is toward in thine eternal cell,\nThat thou so many princes at a shot\nSo bloodily hast struck?\nFIRST AMBASSADOR.\nThe sight is dismal;\nAnd our affairs from England come too late.\nThe ears are senseless that should give us hearing,\nTo tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,\nThat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\nWhere should we have our thanks?\nHORATIO.\nNot from his mouth,\nHad it th'ability of life to thank you.\nHe never gave commandment for their death.\nBut since, so jump upon this bloody question,\nYou from the Polack wars, and you from England\nAre here arriv'd, give order that these bodies\nHigh on a stage be placed to the view,\nAnd let me speak to th' yet unknowing world\nHow these things came about. So shall you hear\nOf carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,\nOf accidental judgements, casual slaughters,\nOf deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause,\nAnd, in this upshot, purposes mistook\nFall'n on the inventors' heads. All this can I\nTruly deliver.\nFORTINBRAS.\nLet us haste to hear it,\nAnd call the noblest to the audience.\nFor me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.\nI have some rights of memory in this kingdom,\nWhich now to claim my vantage doth invite me.\nHORATIO.\nOf that I shall have also cause to speak,\nAnd from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.\nBut let this same be presently perform'd,\nEven while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance\nOn plots and errors happen.\nFORTINBRAS.\nLet four captains\nBear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,\nFor he was likely, had he been put on,\nTo have prov'd most royally; and for his passage,\nThe soldiers' music and the rites of war\nSpeak loudly for him.\nTake up the bodies. Such a sight as this\nBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.\nGo, bid the soldiers shoot.\n[_A dead march._]\n[_Exeunt, bearing off the bodies, after which a peal of ordnance is\nshot off._]",
