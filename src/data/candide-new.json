            "text": "In a castle of Westphalia, belonging to the Baron of\nThunder-ten-Tronckh, lived a youth, whom nature had endowed with the\nmost gentle manners. His countenance was a true picture of his soul. He\ncombined a true judgment with simplicity of spirit, which was the\nreason, I apprehend, of his being called Candide. The old servants of\nthe family suspected him to have been the son of the Baron's sister, by\na good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady would\nnever marry because he had been able to prove only seventy-one\nquarterings, the rest of his genealogical tree having been lost through\nthe injuries of time.\nThe Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his\ncastle had not only a gate, but windows. His great hall, even, was hung\nwith tapestry. All the dogs of his farm-yards formed a pack of hounds at\nneed; his grooms were his huntsmen; and the curate of the village was\nhis grand almoner. They called him \"My Lord,\" and laughed at all his\nstories.\nThe Baron's lady weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, and was\ntherefore a person of great consideration, and she did the honours of\nthe house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect. Her\ndaughter Cunegonde was seventeen years of age, fresh-coloured, comely,\nplump, and desirable. The Baron's son seemed to be in every respect\nworthy of his father. The Preceptor Pangloss[1] was the oracle of the\nfamily, and little Candide heard his lessons with all the good faith of\nhis age and character.\nPangloss was professor of metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology. He\nproved admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that, in\nthis best of all possible worlds, the Baron's castle was the most\nmagnificent of castles, and his lady the best of all possible\nBaronesses.\n\"It is demonstrable,\" said he, \"that things cannot be otherwise than as\nthey are; for all being created for an end, all is necessarily for the\nbest end. Observe, that the nose has been formed to bear\nspectacles--thus we have spectacles. Legs are visibly designed for\nstockings--and we have stockings. Stones were made to be hewn, and to\nconstruct castles--therefore my lord has a magnificent castle; for the\ngreatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Pigs were\nmade to be eaten--therefore we eat pork all the year round. Consequently\nthey who assert that all is well have said a foolish thing, they should\nhave said all is for the best.\"\nCandide listened attentively and believed innocently; for he thought\nMiss Cunegonde extremely beautiful, though he never had the courage to\ntell her so. He concluded that after the happiness of being born of\nBaron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, the second degree of happiness was to be\nMiss Cunegonde, the third that of seeing her every day, and the fourth\nthat of hearing Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole\nprovince, and consequently of the whole world.",

The captain flew into a passion at the\ndisrespectful behaviour of the brute, and slew him on my body. He\nordered my wounds to be dressed, and took me to his quarters as a\nprisoner of war. I washed the few shirts that he had, I did his cooking;\nhe thought me very pretty--he avowed it; on the other hand, I must own\nhe had a good shape, and a soft and white skin; but he had little or no\nmind or philosophy, and you might see plainly that he had never been\ninstructed by Doctor Pangloss. In three months time, having lost all his\nmoney, and being grown tired of my company, he sold me to a Jew, named\nDon Issachar, who traded to Holland and Portugal, and had a strong\npassion for women. This Jew was much attached to my person, but could\nnot triumph over it; I resisted him better than the Bulgarian soldier. A\nmodest woman may be ravished once, but her virtue is strengthened by it.\nIn order to render me more tractable, he brought me to this country\nhouse. Hitherto I had imagined that nothing could equal the beauty of\nThunder-ten-Tronckh Castle; but I found I was mistaken.\n\"The Grand Inquisitor, seeing me one day at Mass, stared long at me, and\nsent to tell me that he wished to speak on private matters. I was\nconducted to his palace, where I acquainted him with the history of my\nfamily, and he represented to me how much it was beneath my rank to\nbelong to an Israelite. A proposal was then made to Don Issachar that he\nshould resign me to my lord. Don Issachar, being the court banker, and a\nman of credit, would hear nothing of it. The Inquisitor threatened him\nwith an _auto-da-f\u00e9_. At last my Jew, intimidated, concluded a bargain,\nby which the house and myself should belong to both in common; the Jew\nshould have for himself Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, and the\nInquisitor should have the rest of the week. It is now six months since\nthis agreement was made. Quarrels have not been wanting, for they could\nnot decide whether the night from Saturday to Sunday belonged to the old\nlaw or to the new. For my part, I have so far held out against both, and\nI verily believe that this is the reason why I am still beloved.",

Fifty sons of the Emperor\nMuley-Ismael[11] had each their adherents; this produced fifty civil\nwars, of blacks against blacks, and blacks against tawnies, and tawnies\nagainst tawnies, and mulattoes against mulattoes. In short it was a\ncontinual carnage throughout the empire.\n\"No sooner were we landed, than the blacks of a contrary faction to that\nof my captain attempted to rob him of his booty. Next to jewels and gold\nwe were the most valuable things he had. I was witness to such a battle\nas you have never seen in your European climates. The northern nations\nhave not that heat in their blood, nor that raging lust for women, so\ncommon in Africa. It seems that you Europeans have only milk in your\nveins; but it is vitriol, it is fire which runs in those of the\ninhabitants of Mount Atlas and the neighbouring countries. They fought\nwith the fury of the lions, tigers, and serpents of the country, to see\nwho should have us. A Moor seized my mother by the right arm, while my\ncaptain's lieutenant held her by the left; a Moorish soldier had hold of\nher by one leg, and one of our corsairs held her by the other. Thus\nalmost all our women were drawn in quarters by four men. My captain\nconcealed me behind him; and with his drawn scimitar cut and slashed\nevery one that opposed his fury. At length I saw all our Italian women,\nand my mother herself, torn, mangled, massacred, by the monsters who\ndisputed over them. The slaves, my companions, those who had taken them,\nsoldiers, sailors, blacks, whites, mulattoes, and at last my captain,\nall were killed, and I remained dying on a heap of dead. Such scenes as\nthis were transacted through an extent of three hundred leagues--and yet\nthey never missed the five prayers a day ordained by Mahomet.",

The Turks killed prodigious numbers\nof the Russians, but the latter had their revenge. Azof was destroyed by\nfire, the inhabitants put to the sword, neither sex nor age was spared;\nuntil there remained only our little fort, and the enemy wanted to\nstarve us out. The twenty Janissaries had sworn they would never\nsurrender. The extremities of famine to which they were reduced, obliged\nthem to eat our two eunuchs, for fear of violating their oath. And at\nthe end of a few days they resolved also to devour the women.\n\"We had a very pious and humane Iman, who preached an excellent sermon,\nexhorting them not to kill us all at once.\n\"'Only cut off a buttock of each of those ladies,' said he, 'and you'll\nfare extremely well; if you must go to it again, there will be the same\nentertainment a few days hence; heaven will accept of so charitable an\naction, and send you relief.'\n\"He had great eloquence; he persuaded them; we underwent this terrible\noperation. The Iman applied the same balsam to us, as he does to\nchildren after circumcision; and we all nearly died.\n\"Scarcely had the Janissaries finished the repast with which we had\nfurnished them, than the Russians came in flat-bottomed boats; not a\nJanissary escaped. The Russians paid no attention to the condition we\nwere in. There are French surgeons in all parts of the world; one of\nthem who was very clever took us under his care--he cured us; and as\nlong as I live I shall remember that as soon as my wounds were healed he\nmade proposals to me. He bid us all be of good cheer, telling us that\nthe like had happened in many sieges, and that it was according to the\nlaws of war.\n\"As soon as my companions could walk, they were obliged to set out for\nMoscow. I fell to the share of a Boyard who made me his gardener, and\ngave me twenty lashes a day. But this nobleman having in two years' time\nbeen broke upon the wheel along with thirty more Boyards for some broils\nat court, I profited by that event; I fled. I traversed all Russia; I\nwas a long time an inn-holder's servant at Riga, the same at Rostock, at\nVismar, at Leipzig, at Cassel, at Utrecht, at Leyden, at the Hague, at\nRotterdam. I waxed old in misery and disgrace, having only one-half of\nmy posteriors, and always remembering I was a Pope's daughter.

Cunegonde, Captain Candide, and the old\nwoman, waited on the Governor, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y\nMascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza. This nobleman had a stateliness\nbecoming a person who bore so many names. He spoke to men with so noble\na disdain, carried his nose so loftily, raised his voice so\nunmercifully, assumed so imperious an air, and stalked with such\nintolerable pride, that those who saluted him were strongly inclined to\ngive him a good drubbing. Cunegonde appeared to him the most beautiful\nhe had ever met. The first thing he did was to ask whether she was not\nthe captain's wife. The manner in which he asked the question alarmed\nCandide; he durst not say she was his wife, because indeed she was not;\nneither durst he say she was his sister, because it was not so; and\nalthough this obliging lie had been formerly much in favour among the\nancients, and although it could be useful to the moderns, his soul was\ntoo pure to betray the truth.\n\"Miss Cunegonde,\" said he, \"is to do me the honour to marry me, and we\nbeseech your excellency to deign to sanction our marriage.\"\nDon Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza,\nturning up his moustachios, smiled mockingly, and ordered Captain\nCandide to go and review his company. Candide obeyed, and the Governor\nremained alone with Miss Cunegonde. He declared his passion, protesting\nhe would marry her the next day in the face of the church, or otherwise,\njust as should be agreeable to herself. Cunegonde asked a quarter of an\nhour to consider of it, to consult the old woman, and to take her\nresolution.",

Candide and Cacambo were disarmed, and their two Andalusian horses\nseized.

He beckoned, and straightway the new-comers were encompassed\nby four-and-twenty soldiers.

An excellent breakfast was provided in vessels\nof gold; and while the Paraguayans were eating maize out of wooden\ndishes, in the open fields and exposed to the heat of the sun, the\nreverend Father Commandant retired to his arbour.\nHe was a very handsome young man, with a full face, white skin but high\nin colour; he had an arched eyebrow, a lively eye, red ears, vermilion\nlips, a bold air, but such a boldness as neither belonged to a Spaniard\nnor a Jesuit. They returned their arms to Candide and Cacambo, and also\nthe two Andalusian horses; to whom Cacambo gave some oats to eat just by\nthe arbour, having an eye upon them all the while for fear of a\nsurprise.\nCandide first kissed the hem of the Commandant's robe, then they sat\ndown to table.\n\"You are, then, a German?\" said the Jesuit to him in that language.\n\"Yes, reverend Father,\" answered Candide.\nAs they pronounced these words they looked at each other with great\namazement, and with such an emotion as they could not conceal.\n\"And from what part of Germany do you come?\" said the Jesuit.\n\"I am from the dirty province of Westphalia,\" answered Candide; \"I was\nborn in the Castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh.\"\n\"Oh! Heavens! is it possible?\" cried the Commandant.\n\"What a miracle!\" cried Candide.\n\"Is it really you?\" said the Commandant.\n\"It is not possible!\" said Candide.\nThey drew back; they embraced; they shed rivulets of tears.\n\"What, is it you, reverend Father? You, the brother of the fair\nCunegonde! You, that was slain by the Bulgarians! You, the Baron's son!\nYou, a Jesuit in Paraguay! I must confess this is a strange world that\nwe live in. Oh, Pangloss! Pangloss! how glad you would be if you had not\nbeen hanged!\"\nThe Commandant sent away the negro slaves and the Paraguayans, who\nserved them with liquors in goblets of rock-crystal. He thanked God and\nSt. Ignatius a thousand times; he clasped Candide in his arms; and their\nfaces were all bathed with tears.\n\"You will be more surprised, more affected, and transported,\" said\nCandide, \"when I tell you that Cunegonde, your sister, whom you believe\nto have been ripped open, is in perfect health.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"In your neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres; and I was\ngoing to fight against you.\"\nEvery word which they uttered in this long conversation but added wonder\nto wonder.

When the Bulgarians\nretired, my dear sister could not be found; but my mother, my father,\nand myself, with two maid-servants and three little boys all of whom had\nbeen slain, were put in a hearse, to be conveyed for interment to a\nchapel belonging to the Jesuits, within two leagues of our family seat.\nA Jesuit sprinkled us with some holy water; it was horribly salt; a few\ndrops of it fell into my eyes; the father perceived that my eyelids\nstirred a little; he put his hand upon my heart and felt it beat. I\nreceived assistance, and at the end of three weeks I recovered. You\nknow, my dear Candide, I was very pretty; but I grew much prettier, and\nthe reverend Father Didrie,[16] Superior of that House, conceived the\ntenderest friendship for me; he gave me the habit of the order, some\nyears after I was sent to Rome. The Father-General needed new levies of\nyoung German-Jesuits. The sovereigns of Paraguay admit as few Spanish\nJesuits as possible; they prefer those of other nations as being more\nsubordinate to their commands. I was judged fit by the reverend\nFather-General to go and work in this vineyard. We set out--a Pole, a\nTyrolese, and myself. Upon my arrival I was honoured with a\nsub-deaconship and a lieutenancy. I am to-day colonel and priest. We\nshall give a warm reception to the King of Spain's troops; I will answer\nfor it that they shall be excommunicated and well beaten. Providence\nsends you here to assist us. But is it, indeed, true that my dear sister\nCunegonde is in the neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres?\"\nCandide assured him on oath that nothing was more true, and their tears\nbegan afresh.",

The wary Cacambo had taken\ncare to fill his wallet with bread, chocolate, bacon, fruit, and a few\nbottles of wine. With their Andalusian horses they penetrated into an\nunknown country, where they perceived no beaten track. At length they\ncame to a beautiful meadow intersected with purling rills. Here our two\nadventurers fed their horses. Cacambo proposed to his master to take\nsome food, and he set him an example.\n\"How can you ask me to eat ham,\" said Candide, \"after killing the\nBaron's son, and being doomed never more to see the beautiful Cunegonde?\nWhat will it avail me to spin out my wretched days and drag them far\nfrom her in remorse and despair? And what will the _Journal of\nTrevoux_[17] say?\"\nWhile he was thus lamenting his fate, he went on eating. The sun went\ndown. The two wanderers heard some little cries which seemed to be\nuttered by women. They did not know whether they were cries of pain or\njoy; but they started up precipitately with that inquietude and alarm\nwhich every little thing inspires in an unknown country. The noise was\nmade by two naked girls, who tripped along the mead, while two monkeys\nwere pursuing them and biting their buttocks. Candide was moved with\npity; he had learned to fire a gun in the Bulgarian service, and he was\nso clever at it, that he could hit a filbert in a hedge without touching\na leaf of the tree. He took up his double-barrelled Spanish fusil, let\nit off, and killed the two monkeys.\n\"God be praised! My dear Cacambo, I have rescued those two poor\ncreatures from a most perilous situation. If I have committed a sin in\nkilling an Inquisitor and a Jesuit, I have made ample amends by saving\nthe lives of these girls. Perhaps they are young ladies of family; and\nthis adventure may procure us great advantages in this country.\"\nHe was continuing, but stopped short when he saw the two girls tenderly\nembracing the monkeys, bathing their bodies in tears, and rending the\nair with the most dismal lamentations.\n\"Little did I expect to see such good-nature,\" said he at length to\nCacambo; who made answer:\n\"Master, you have done a fine thing now; you have slain the sweethearts\nof those two young ladies.\"\n\"The sweethearts! Is it possible? You are jesting, Cacambo, I can never\nbelieve it!\"\n\"Dear master,\" replied Cacambo; \"you are surprised at everything. Why\nshould you think it so strange that in some countries there are monkeys\nwhich insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies; they are\na fourth part human, as I am a fourth part Spaniard.\"\n\"Alas!\" replied Candide, \"I remember to have heard Master Pangloss say,\nthat formerly such accidents used to happen; that these mixtures were\nproductive of Centaurs, Fauns, and Satyrs; and that many of the ancients\nhad seen such monsters, but I looked upon the whole as fabulous.\"\n\"You ought now to be convinced,\" said Cacambo, \"that it is the truth,\nand you see what use is made of those creatures, by persons that have\nnot had a proper education; all I fear is that those ladies will play us\nsome ugly trick.\"",

They were encompassed by fifty naked Oreillons, armed\nwith bows and arrows, with clubs and flint hatchets. Some were making a\nlarge cauldron boil, others were preparing spits, and all cried:\n\"A Jesuit! a Jesuit! we shall be revenged, we shall have excellent\ncheer, let us eat the Jesuit, let us eat him up!\"\n\"I told you, my dear master,\" cried Cacambo sadly, \"that those two girls\nwould play us some ugly trick.\"\nCandide seeing the cauldron and the spits, cried:\n\"We are certainly going to be either roasted or boiled. Ah! what would\nMaster Pangloss say, were he to see how pure nature is formed?\nEverything is right, may be, but I declare it is very hard to have lost\nMiss Cunegonde and to be put upon a spit by Oreillons.\"\nCacambo never lost his head.\n\"Do not despair,\" said he to the disconsolate Candide, \"I understand a\nlittle of the jargon of these people, I will speak to them.\"\n\"Be sure,\" said Candide, \"to represent to them how frightfully inhuman\nit is to cook men, and how very un-Christian.\"\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Cacambo, \"you reckon you are to-day going to feast\nupon a Jesuit. It is all very well, nothing is more unjust than thus to\ntreat your enemies. Indeed, the law of nature teaches us to kill our\nneighbour, and such is the practice all over the world. If we do not\naccustom ourselves to eating them, it is because we have better fare.\nBut you have not the same resources as we; certainly it is much better\nto devour your enemies than to resign to the crows and rooks the fruits\nof your victory. But, gentlemen, surely you would not choose to eat your\nfriends. You believe that you are going to spit a Jesuit, and he is your\ndefender. It is the enemy of your enemies that you are going to roast.\nAs for myself, I was born in your country; this gentleman is my master,\nand, far from being a Jesuit, he has just killed one, whose spoils he\nwears; and thence comes your mistake. To convince you of the truth of\nwhat I say, take his habit and carry it to the first barrier of the\nJesuit kingdom, and inform yourselves whether my master did not kill a\nJesuit officer. It will not take you long, and you can always eat us if\nyou find that I have lied to you. But I have told you the truth. You are\ntoo well acquainted with the principles of public law, humanity, and\njustice not to pardon us.\"\nThe Oreillons found this speech very reasonable. They deputed two of\ntheir principal people with all expedition to inquire into the truth of\nthe matter; these executed their commission like men of sense, and soon\nreturned with good news. The Oreillons untied their prisoners, showed\nthem all sorts of civilities, offered them girls, gave them refreshment,\nand reconducted them to the confines of their territories, proclaiming\nwith great joy:\n\"He is no Jesuit! He is no Jesuit!\"",

He\nassembled them at his inn, and gave them a supper on condition that each\ntook an oath to relate his history faithfully, promising to choose him\nwho appeared to be most justly discontented with his state, and to\nbestow some presents upon the rest.\nThey sat until four o'clock in the morning. Candide, in listening to all\ntheir adventures, was reminded of what the old woman had said to him in\ntheir voyage to Buenos Ayres, and of her wager that there was not a\nperson on board the ship but had met with very great misfortunes. He\ndreamed of Pangloss at every adventure told to him.\n\"This Pangloss,\" said he, \"would be puzzled to demonstrate his system. I\nwish that he were here. Certainly, if all things are good, it is in El\nDorado and not in the rest of the world.\"\nAt length he made choice of a poor man of letters, who had worked ten\nyears for the booksellers of Amsterdam. He judged that there was not in\nthe whole world a trade which could disgust one more.\nThis philosopher was an honest man; but he had been robbed by his wife,\nbeaten by his son, and abandoned by his daughter who got a Portuguese to\nrun away with her. He had just been deprived of a small employment, on\nwhich he subsisted; and he was persecuted by the preachers of Surinam,\nwho took him for a Socinian. We must allow that the others were at least\nas wretched as he; but Candide hoped that the philosopher would\nentertain him during the voyage. All the other candidates complained\nthat Candide had done them great injustice; but he appeased them by\ngiving one hundred piastres to each.",

All these kinds are found there. It is a chaos--a confused\nmultitude, where everybody seeks pleasure and scarcely any one finds it,\nat least as it appeared to me. I made a short stay there. On my arrival\nI was robbed of all I had by pickpockets at the fair of St. Germain. I\nmyself was taken for a robber and was imprisoned for eight days, after\nwhich I served as corrector of the press to gain the money necessary for\nmy return to Holland on foot.

The author does not know a word of Arabic, yet the scene is in\nArabia; moreover he is a man that does not believe in innate ideas; and\nI will bring you, to-morrow, twenty pamphlets written against him.\"[22]\n\"How many dramas have you in France, sir?\" said Candide to the Abb\u00e9.\n\"Five or six thousand.\"\n\"What a number!\" said Candide. \"How many good?\"\n\"Fifteen or sixteen,\" replied the other.\n\"What a number!\" said Martin.\nCandide was very pleased with an actress who played Queen Elizabeth in a\nsomewhat insipid tragedy[23] sometimes acted.\n\"That actress,\" said he to Martin, \"pleases me much; she has a likeness\nto Miss Cunegonde; I should be very glad to wait upon her.\"\nThe Perigordian Abb\u00e9 offered to introduce him. Candide, brought up in\nGermany, asked what was the etiquette, and how they treated queens of\nEngland in France.\n\"It is necessary to make distinctions,\" said the Abb\u00e9. \"In the provinces\none takes them to the inn; in Paris, one respects them when they are\nbeautiful, and throws them on the highway when they are dead.\"[24]\n\"Queens on the highway!\" said Candide.\n\"Yes, truly,\" said Martin, \"the Abb\u00e9 is right. I was in Paris when Miss\nMonime passed, as the saying is, from this life to the other. She was\nrefused what people call the _honours of sepulture_--that is to say, of\nrotting with all the beggars of the neighbourhood in an ugly cemetery;\nshe was interred all alone by her company at the corner of the Rue de\nBourgogne, which ought to trouble her much, for she thought nobly.\"\n\"That was very uncivil,\" said Candide.\n\"What would you have?\" said Martin; \"these people are made thus. Imagine\nall contradictions, all possible incompatibilities--you will find them\nin the government, in the law-courts, in the churches, in the public\nshows of this droll nation.\"\n\"Is it true that they always laugh in Paris?\" said Candide.\n\"Yes,\" said the Abb\u00e9, \"but it means nothing, for they complain of\neverything with great fits of laughter; they even do the most detestable\nthings while laughing.\"\n\"Who,\" said Candide, \"is that great pig who spoke so ill of the piece at\nwhich I wept, and of the actors who gave me so much pleasure?\"\n\"He is a bad character,\" answered the Abb\u00e9, \"who gains his livelihood by\nsaying evil of all plays and of all books. He hates whatever succeeds,\nas the eunuchs hate those who enjoy; he is one of the serpents of\nliterature who nourish themselves on dirt and spite; he is a\n_folliculaire_.\"\n\"What is a _folliculaire_?\" said Candide.\n\"It is,\" said the Abb\u00e9, \"a pamphleteer--a Fr\u00e9ron.\"[25]\nThus Candide, Martin, and the Perigordian conversed on the staircase,\nwhile watching every one go out after the performance.",

The\nman of taste explained very well how a piece could have some interest,\nand have almost no merit; he proved in few words that it was not enough\nto introduce one or two of those situations which one finds in all\nromances, and which always seduce the spectator, but that it was\nnecessary to be new without being odd, often sublime and always\nnatural, to know the human heart and to make it speak; to be a great\npoet without allowing any person in the piece to appear to be a poet; to\nknow language perfectly--to speak it with purity, with continuous\nharmony and without rhythm ever taking anything from sense.\n\"Whoever,\" added he, \"does not observe all these rules can produce one\nor two tragedies, applauded at a theatre, but he will never be counted\nin the ranks of good writers. There are very few good tragedies; some\nare idylls in dialogue, well written and well rhymed, others political\nreasonings which lull to sleep, or amplifications which repel; others\ndemoniac dreams in barbarous style, interrupted in sequence, with long\napostrophes to the gods, because they do not know how to speak to men,\nwith false maxims, with bombastic commonplaces!\"\nCandide listened with attention to this discourse, and conceived a great\nidea of the speaker, and as the Marchioness had taken care to place him\nbeside her, he leaned towards her and took the liberty of asking who was\nthe man who had spoken so well.\n\"He is a scholar,\" said the lady, \"who does not play, whom the Abb\u00e9\nsometimes brings to supper; he is perfectly at home among tragedies and\nbooks, and he has written a tragedy which was hissed, and a book of\nwhich nothing has ever been seen outside his bookseller's shop\nexcepting the copy which he dedicated to me.\"\n\"The great man!\" said Candide. \"He is another Pangloss!\"",

I have been informed of the frightful disasters that befell\nthe family of my lady Baroness, and the fair Cunegonde. I swear to you\nthat my fate has been scarcely less sad. I was very innocent when you\nknew me. A Grey Friar, who was my confessor, easily seduced me. The\nconsequences were terrible. I was obliged to quit the castle some time\nafter the Baron had sent you away with kicks on the backside. If a\nfamous surgeon had not taken compassion on me, I should have died. For\nsome time I was this surgeon's mistress, merely out of gratitude. His\nwife, who was mad with jealousy, beat me every day unmercifully; she was\na fury. The surgeon was one of the ugliest of men, and I the most\nwretched of women, to be continually beaten for a man I did not love.\nYou know, sir, what a dangerous thing it is for an ill-natured woman to\nbe married to a doctor. Incensed at the behaviour of his wife, he one\nday gave her so effectual a remedy to cure her of a slight cold, that\nshe died two hours after, in most horrid convulsions. The wife's\nrelations prosecuted the husband; he took flight, and I was thrown into\njail. My innocence would not have saved me if I had not been\ngood-looking. The judge set me free, on condition that he succeeded the\nsurgeon. I was soon supplanted by a rival, turned out of doors quite\ndestitute, and obliged to continue this abominable trade, which appears\nso pleasant to you men, while to us women it is the utmost abyss of\nmisery. I have come to exercise the profession at Venice. Ah! sir, if\nyou could only imagine what it is to be obliged to caress indifferently\nan old merchant, a lawyer, a monk, a gondolier, an abb\u00e9, to be exposed\nto abuse and insults; to be often reduced to borrowing a petticoat, only\nto go and have it raised by a disagreeable man; to be robbed by one of\nwhat one has earned from another; to be subject to the extortions of the\nofficers of justice; and to have in prospect only a frightful old age, a\nhospital, and a dung-hill; you would conclude that I am one of the most\nunhappy creatures in the world.\"[33]",

Martin was\nentirely of the Senator's opinion.\nThey sat down to table, and after an excellent dinner they went into the\nlibrary. Candide, seeing a Homer magnificently bound, commended the\nvirtuoso on his good taste.\n\"There,\" said he, \"is a book that was once the delight of the great\nPangloss, the best philosopher in Germany.\"\n\"It is not mine,\" answered Pococurante coolly. \"They used at one time to\nmake me believe that I took a pleasure in reading him. But that\ncontinual repetition of battles, so extremely like one another; those\ngods that are always active without doing anything decisive; that Helen\nwho is the cause of the war, and who yet scarcely appears in the piece;\nthat Troy, so long besieged without being taken; all these together\ncaused me great weariness. I have sometimes asked learned men whether\nthey were not as weary as I of that work. Those who were sincere have\nowned to me that the poem made them fall asleep; yet it was necessary to\nhave it in their library as a monument of antiquity, or like those rusty\nmedals which are no longer of use in commerce.\"\n\"But your Excellency does not think thus of Virgil?\" said Candide.\n\"I grant,\" said the Senator, \"that the second, fourth, and sixth books\nof his _\u00c6neid_ are excellent, but as for his pious \u00c6neas, his strong\nCloanthus, his friend Achates, his little Ascanius, his silly King\nLatinus, his bourgeois Amata, his insipid Lavinia, I think there can be\nnothing more flat and disagreeable. I prefer Tasso a good deal, or even\nthe soporific tales of Ariosto.\"\n\"May I presume to ask you, sir,\" said Candide, \"whether you do not\nreceive a great deal of pleasure from reading Horace?\"\n\"There are maxims in this writer,\" answered Pococurante, \"from which a\nman of the world may reap great benefit, and being written in energetic\nverse they are more easily impressed upon the memory. But I care little\nfor his journey to Brundusium, and his account of a bad dinner, or of\nhis low quarrel between one Rupilius whose words he says were full of\npoisonous filth, and another whose language was imbued with vinegar. I\nhave read with much distaste his indelicate verses against old women and\nwitches; nor do I see any merit in telling his friend M\u00e6cenas that if he\nwill but rank him in the choir of lyric poets, his lofty head shall\ntouch the stars. Fools admire everything in an author of reputation. For\nmy part, I read only to please myself. I like only that which serves my\npurpose.\"\nCandide, having been educated never to judge for himself, was much\nsurprised at what he heard. Martin found there was a good deal of reason\nin Pococurante's remarks.\n\"Oh! here is Cicero,\" said Candide. \"Here is the great man whom I fancy\nyou are never tired of reading.\"\n\"I never read him,\" replied the Venetian. \"What is it to me whether he\npleads for Rabirius or Cluentius? I try causes enough myself; his\nphilosophical works seem to me better, but when I found that he doubted\nof everything, I concluded that I knew as much as he, and that I had no\nneed of a guide to learn ignorance.\"\n\"Ha! here are four-score volumes of the Academy of Sciences,\" cried\nMartin. \"Perhaps there is something valuable in this collection.\"\n\"There might be,\" said Pococurante, \"if only one of those rakers of\nrubbish had shown how to make pins; but in all these volumes there is\nnothing but chimerical systems, and not a single useful thing.\"\n\"And what dramatic works I see here,\" said Candide, \"in Italian,\nSpanish, and French.\"\n\"Yes,\" replied the Senator, \"there are three thousand, and not three\ndozen of them good for anything. As to those collections of sermons,\nwhich altogether are not worth a single page of Seneca, and those huge\nvolumes of theology, you may well imagine that neither I nor any one\nelse ever opens them.\"\nMartin saw some shelves filled with English books.\n\"I have a notion,\" said he, \"that a Republican must be greatly pleased\nwith most of these books, which are written with a spirit of freedom.\"\n\"Yes,\" answered Pococurante, \"it is noble to write as one thinks; this\nis the privilege of humanity. In all our Italy we write only what we do\nnot think; those who inhabit the country of the C\u00e6sars and the\nAntoninuses dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a\nDominican friar. I should be pleased with the liberty which inspires the\nEnglish genius if passion and party spirit did not corrupt all that is\nestimable in this precious liberty.\"\nCandide, observing a Milton, asked whether he did not look upon this\nauthor as a great man.\n\"Who?\" said Pococurante, \"that barbarian, who writes a long commentary\nin ten books of harsh verse on the first chapter of Genesis; that coarse\nimitator of the Greeks, who disfigures the Creation, and who, while\nMoses represents the Eternal producing the world by a word, makes the\nMessiah take a great pair of compasses from the armoury of heaven to\ncircumscribe His work? How can I have any esteem for a writer who has\nspoiled Tasso's hell and the devil, who transforms Lucifer sometimes\ninto a toad and other times into a pigmy, who makes him repeat the same\nthings a hundred times, who makes him dispute on theology, who, by a\nserious imitation of Ariosto's comic invention of firearms, represents\nthe devils cannonading in heaven? Neither I nor any man in Italy could\ntake pleasure in those melancholy extravagances; and the marriage of Sin\nand Death, and the snakes brought forth by Sin, are enough to turn the\nstomach of any one with the least taste, [and his long description of a\npest-house is good only for a grave-digger]. This obscure, whimsical,\nand disagreeable poem was despised upon its first publication, and I\nonly treat it now as it was treated in its own country by\ncontemporaries. For the matter of that I say what I think, and I care\nvery little whether others think as I do.\"",

My\nnephew, the great Sultan Mahmoud, permits me to travel sometimes for my\nhealth, and I am come to spend the Carnival at Venice.\"\nA young man who sat next to Achmet, spoke then as follows:\n\"My name is Ivan. I was once Emperor of all the Russias, but was\ndethroned in my cradle. My parents were confined in prison and I was\neducated there; yet I am sometimes allowed to travel in company with\npersons who act as guards; and I am come to spend the Carnival at\nVenice.\"\nThe third said:\n\"I am Charles Edward, King of England; my father has resigned all his\nlegal rights to me. I have fought in defence of them; and above eight\nhundred of my adherents have been hanged, drawn, and quartered. I have\nbeen confined in prison; I am going to Rome, to pay a visit to the King,\nmy father, who was dethroned as well as myself and my grandfather, and I\nam come to spend the Carnival at Venice.\"\nThe fourth spoke thus in his turn:\n\"I am the King of Poland; the fortune of war has stripped me of my\nhereditary dominions; my father underwent the same vicissitudes; I\nresign myself to Providence in the same manner as Sultan Achmet, the\nEmperor Ivan, and King Charles Edward, whom God long preserve; and I am\ncome to the Carnival at Venice.\"\nThe fifth said:\n\"I am King of Poland also; I have been twice dethroned; but Providence\nhas given me another country, where I have done more good than all the\nSarmatian kings were ever capable of doing on the banks of the Vistula;\nI resign myself likewise to Providence, and am come to pass the Carnival\nat Venice.\"\nIt was now the sixth monarch's turn to speak:\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"I am not so great a prince as any of you;\nhowever, I am a king. I am Theodore, elected King of Corsica; I had the\ntitle of Majesty, and now I am scarcely treated as a gentleman. I have\ncoined money, and now am not worth a farthing; I have had two\nsecretaries of state, and now I have scarce a valet; I have seen myself\non a throne, and I have seen myself upon straw in a common jail in\nLondon.

Then without losing time, he and his\ncompanions went on board a galley, in order to search on the banks of\nthe Propontis for his Cunegonde, however ugly she might have become.\nAmong the crew there were two slaves who rowed very badly, and to whose\nbare shoulders the Levantine captain would now and then apply blows from\na bull's pizzle. Candide, from a natural impulse, looked at these two\nslaves more attentively than at the other oarsmen, and approached them\nwith pity. Their features though greatly disfigured, had a slight\nresemblance to those of Pangloss and the unhappy Jesuit and Westphalian\nBaron, brother to Miss Cunegonde. This moved and saddened him. He looked\nat them still more attentively.\n\"Indeed,\" said he to Cacambo, \"if I had not seen Master Pangloss hanged,\nand if I had not had the misfortune to kill the Baron, I should think it\nwas they that were rowing.\"\nAt the names of the Baron and of Pangloss, the two galley-slaves uttered\na loud cry, held fast by the seat, and let drop their oars. The captain\nran up to them and redoubled his blows with the bull's pizzle.\n\"Stop! stop! sir,\" cried Candide. \"I will give you what money you\nplease.\"\n\"What! it is Candide!\" said one of the slaves.\n\"What! it is Candide!\" said the other.\n\"Do I dream?\" cried Candide; \"am I awake? or am I on board a galley? Is\nthis the Baron whom I killed? Is this Master Pangloss whom I saw\nhanged?\"\n\"It is we! it is we!\" answered they.\n\"Well! is this the great philosopher?\" said Martin.\n\"Ah! captain,\" said Candide, \"what ransom will you take for Monsieur de\nThunder-ten-Tronckh, one of the first barons of the empire, and for\nMonsieur Pangloss, the profoundest metaphysician in Germany?\"\n\"Dog of a Christian,\" answered the Levantine captain, \"since these two\ndogs of Christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians, which I doubt\nnot are high dignities in their country, you shall give me fifty\nthousand sequins.\"\n\"You shall have them, sir. Carry me back at once to Constantinople, and\nyou shall receive the money directly. But no; carry me first to Miss\nCunegonde.\"\nUpon the first proposal made by Candide, however, the Levantine captain\nhad already tacked about, and made the crew ply their oars quicker than\na bird cleaves the air.\nCandide embraced the Baron and Pangloss a hundred times.\n\"And how happened it, my dear Baron, that I did not kill you? And, my\ndear Pangloss, how came you to life again after being hanged? And why\nare you both in a Turkish galley?\"\n\"And it is true that my dear sister is in this country?\" said the Baron.\n\"Yes,\" answered Cacambo.\n\"Then I behold, once more, my dear Candide,\" cried Pangloss.\nCandide presented Martin and Cacambo to them; they embraced each other,\nand all spoke at once. The galley flew; they were already in the port.\nInstantly Candide sent for a Jew, to whom he sold for fifty thousand\nsequins a diamond worth a hundred thousand, though the fellow swore to\nhim by Abraham that he could give him no more. He immediately paid the\nransom for the Baron and Pangloss. The latter threw himself at the feet\nof his deliverer, and bathed them with his tears; the former thanked him\nwith a nod, and promised to return him the money on the first\nopportunity.\n\"But is it indeed possible that my sister can be in Turkey?\" said he.\n\"Nothing is more possible,\" said Cacambo, \"since she scours the dishes\nin the service of a Transylvanian prince.\"\nCandide sent directly for two Jews and sold them some more diamonds, and\nthen they all set out together in another galley to deliver Cunegonde",

I should have been\nburnt, but you may remember it rained exceedingly hard when they were\ngoing to roast me; the storm was so violent that they despaired of\nlighting the fire, so I was hanged because they could do no better. A\nsurgeon purchased my body, carried me home, and dissected me. He began\nwith making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula.\nOne could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the\nHoly Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people\nmarvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was\nwet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short,\nI still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a\nfrightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back, and imagining\nthat he had been dissecting the devil he ran away, dying with fear, and\nfell down the staircase in his flight. His wife, hearing the noise,\nflew from the next room. She saw me stretched out upon the table with my\ncrucial incision. She was seized with yet greater fear than her husband,\nfled, and tumbled over him. When they came to themselves a little, I\nheard the wife say to her husband: 'My dear, how could you take it into\nyour head to dissect a heretic? Do you not know that these people always\nhave the devil in their bodies? I will go and fetch a priest this minute\nto exorcise him.' At this proposal I shuddered, and mustering up what\nlittle courage I had still remaining I cried out aloud, 'Have mercy on\nme!' At length the Portuguese barber plucked up his spirits. He sewed up\nmy wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of\nfifteen days. The barber found me a place as lackey to a knight of Malta\nwho was going to Venice, but finding that my master had no money to pay\nme my wages I entered the service of a Venetian merchant, and went with\nhim to Constantinople. One day I took it into my head to step into a\nmosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was\nsaying her paternosters. Her bosom was uncovered, and between her\nbreasts she had a beautiful bouquet of tulips, roses, anemones,\nranunculus, hyacinths, and auriculas. She dropped her bouquet; I picked\nit up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long\nin delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was\na Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who\nordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the\ngalleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the\nyoung Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from\nMarseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told\nus similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had\nsuffered greater injustice than I, and I insisted that it was far more\ninnocent to take up a bouquet and place it again on a woman's bosom than\nto be found stark naked with an Ichoglan. We were continually disputing,\nand received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation\nof universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough\nto ransom us.\"",

But he was so much imposed upon by the Jews that he had\nnothing left except his small farm; his wife became uglier every day,\nmore peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more\nfretful than Cunegonde. Cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took\nvegetables for sale to Constantinople, was fatigued with hard work, and\ncursed his destiny. Pangloss was in despair at not shining in some\nGerman university. For Martin, he was firmly persuaded that he would be\nas badly off elsewhere, and therefore bore things patiently. Candide,\nMartin, and Pangloss sometimes disputed about morals and metaphysics.\nThey often saw passing under the windows of their farm boats full of\nEffendis, Pashas, and Cadis, who were going into banishment to Lemnos,\nMitylene, or Erzeroum. And they saw other Cadis, Pashas, and Effendis\ncoming to supply the place of the exiles, and afterwards exiled in their\nturn. They saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the Sublime\nPorte. Such spectacles as these increased the number of their\ndissertations; and when they did not dispute time hung so heavily upon\ntheir hands, that one day the old woman ventured to say to them:\n\"I want to know which is worse, to be ravished a hundred times by negro\npirates, to have a buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the\nBulgarians, to be whipped and hanged at an _auto-da-f\u00e9_, to be\ndissected, to row in the galleys--in short, to go through all the\nmiseries we have undergone, or to stay here and have nothing to do?\"\n\"It is a great question,\" said Candide.\nThis discourse gave rise to new reflections, and Martin especially\nconcluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting\ninquietude or of lethargic disgust.

For, in short, Eglon, King of Moab, was\nassassinated by Ehud; Absalom was hung by his hair, and pierced with\nthree darts; King Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, was killed by Baasa; King\nEla by Zimri; Ahaziah by Jehu; Athaliah by Jehoiada; the Kings\nJehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, were led into captivity. You know how\nperished Croesus, Astyages, Darius, Dionysius of Syracuse, Pyrrhus,\nPerseus, Hannibal, Jugurtha, Ariovistus, C\u00e6sar, Pompey, Nero, Otho,\nVitellius, Domitian, Richard II. of England, Edward II., Henry VI.,\nRichard III., Mary Stuart, Charles I., the three Henrys of France, the\nEmperor Henry IV.! You know----\"\n\"I know also,\" said Candide, \"that we must cultivate our garden.\"\n\"You are right,\" said Pangloss, \"for when man was first placed in the\nGarden of Eden, he was put there _ut operaretur eum_, that he might\ncultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle.\"\n\"Let us work,\" said Martin, \"without disputing; it is the only way to\nrender life tolerable.\"\nThe whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to\ntheir different abilities. Their little plot of land produced plentiful\ncrops. Cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she became an excellent\npastry cook; Paquette worked at embroidery; the old woman looked after\nthe linen. They were all, not excepting Friar Girofl\u00e9e, of some service\nor other; for he made a good joiner, and became a very honest man.\nPangloss sometimes said to Candide:\n\"There is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds:\nfor if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of\nMiss Cunegonde: if you had not been put into the Inquisition: if you had\nnot walked over America: if you had not stabbed the Baron: if you had\nnot lost all your sheep from the fine country of El Dorado: you would\nnot be here eating preserved citrons and pistachio-nuts.\"\n\"All that is very well,\" answered Candide, \"but let us cultivate our\ngarden.\"",
