By nature impulsive, capricious, and vehement,\nshe had always longed for liberty; and she had never possessed it.\nShe had been brought up among violent family quarrels, had been early\nseparated from her disreputable and eccentric mother, and handed over to\nthe care of her disreputable and selfish father. When she was seventeen,\nhe decided to marry her off to the Prince of Orange; she, at first,\nacquiesced; but, suddenly falling in love with Prince Augustus of\nPrussia, she determined to break off the engagement. This was not her\nfirst love affair, for she had previously carried on a clandestine\ncorrespondence with a Captain Hess. Prince Augustus was already married,\nmorganatically, but she did not know it, and he did not tell her. While\nshe was spinning out the negotiations with the Prince of Orange, the\nallied sovereign--it was June, 1814--arrived in London to celebrate\ntheir victory. Among them, in the suite of the Emperor of Russia, was\nthe young and handsome Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. He made several\nattempts to attract the notice of the Princess, but she, with her heart\nelsewhere, paid very little attention. Next month the Prince Regent,\ndiscovering that his daughter was having secret meetings with Prince\nAugustus, suddenly appeared upon the scene and, after dismissing her\nhousehold, sentenced her to a strict seclusion in Windsor Park. \"God\nAlmighty grant me patience!\" she exclaimed, falling on her knees in an\nagony of agitation: then she jumped up, ran down the backstairs and out\ninto the street, hailed a passing cab, and drove to her mother's house\nin Bayswater. She was discovered, pursued, and at length, yielding\nto the persuasions of her uncles, the Dukes of York and Sussex, of\nBrougham, and of the Bishop of Salisbury, she returned to Carlton House\nat two o'clock in the morning. She was immured at Windsor, but no more\nwas heard of the Prince of Orange. Prince Augustus, too, disappeared.",

Here he had met Prince Leopold, who had\nbeen struck by his ability, and, on his marriage, brought him to England\nas his personal physician. A curious fate awaited this young man;\nmany were the gifts which the future held in store for him--many and\nvarious--influence, power, mystery, unhappiness, a broken heart. At\nClaremont his position was a very humble one; but the Princess took\na fancy to him, called him \"Stocky,\" and romped with him along the\ncorridors. Dyspeptic by constitution, melancholic by temperament, he\ncould yet be lively on occasion, and was known as a wit in Coburg. He\nwas virtuous, too, and served the royal menage with approbation. \"My\nmaster,\" he wrote in his diary, \"is the best of all husbands in all the\nfive quarters of the globe; and his wife bears him an amount of love,\nthe greatness of which can only be compared with the English national\ndebt.\" Before long he gave proof of another quality--a quality which was\nto colour the whole of his life-cautious sagacity. When, in the spring\nof 1817, it was known that the Princess was expecting a child, the post\nof one of her physicians-in-ordinary was offered to him, and he had\nthe good sense to refuse it. He perceived that his colleagues would be\njealous of him, that his advice would probably not be taken, but that,\nif anything were to go wrong, it would be certainly the foreign doctor",

            "text": "The fourth son of George III was Edward, Duke of Kent. He was now fifty\nyears of age--a tall, stout, vigorous man, highly-coloured, with bushy\neyebrows, a bald top to his head, and what hair he had carefully dyed a\nglossy black. His dress was extremely neat, and in his whole appearance\nthere was a rigidity which did not belie his character. He had spent\nhis early life in the army--at Gibraltar, in Canada, in the West\nIndies--and, under the influence of military training, had become at\nfirst a disciplinarian and at last a martinet. In 1802, having been sent\nto Gibraltar to restore order in a mutinous garrison, he was recalled\nfor undue severity, and his active career had come to an end. Since then\nhe had spent his life regulating his domestic arrangements with great\nexactitude, busying himself with the affairs of his numerous dependents,\ndesigning clocks, and struggling to restore order to his finances, for,\nin spite of his being, as someone said who knew him well \"regle comme du\npapier a musique,\" and in spite of an income of L24,000 a year, he\nwas hopelessly in debt. He had quarrelled with most of his brothers,\nparticularly with the Prince Regent, and it was only natural that he\nshould have joined the political Opposition and become a pillar of the\nWhigs.\nWhat his political opinions may actually have been is open to doubt; it\nhas often been asserted that he was a Liberal, or even a Radical; and,\nif we are to believe Robert Owen, he was a necessitarian Socialist. His\nrelations with Owen--the shrewd, gullible, high-minded, wrong-headed,\nillustrious and preposterous father of Socialism and Co-operation--were\ncurious and characteristic. He talked of visiting the Mills at New\nLanark, he did, in fact, preside at one of Owen's public meetings;\nhe corresponded with him on confidential terms, and he even (so Owen\nassures us) returned, after his death, from \"the sphere of spirits\" to\ngive encouragement to the Owenites on earth. \"In an especial manner,\"\nsays Owen, \"I have to name the very anxious feelings of the spirit of\nhis Royal Highness the Late Duke of Kent (who early informed me\nthat there were no titles in the spititual spheres into which he had\nentered), to benefit, not a class, a sect, a party, or any particular\ncountry, but the whole of the human race, through futurity.\" \"His whole\nspirit-proceeding with me has been most beautiful,\" Owen adds, \"making\nhis own appointments; and never in one instance has this spirit not\nbeen punctual to the minute he had named.\" But Owen was of a sanguine\ntemperament. He also numbered among his proselytes President Jefferson,\nPrince Metternich, and Napoleon; so that some uncertainty must still\nlinger over the Duke of Kent's views. But there is no uncertainty about\nanother circumstance: his Royal Highness borrowed from Robert Owen, on\nvarious occasions, various sums of money which were never repaid and\namounted in all to several hundred pounds.",

            "text": "After the death of the Princess Charlotte it was clearly important, for\nmore than one reason, that the Duke of Kent should marry. From the point\nof view of the nation, the lack of heirs in the reigning family seemed\nto make the step almost obligatory; it was also likely to be highly\nexpedient from the point of view of the Duke. To marry as a public\nduty, for the sake of the royal succession, would surely deserve some\nrecognition from a grateful country. When the Duke of York had married\nhe had received a settlement of L25,000 a year. Why should not the Duke\nof Kent look forward to an equal sum? But the situation was not quite\nsimple. There was the Duke of Clarence to be considered; he was the\nelder brother, and, if HE married, would clearly have the prior claim.\nOn the other hand, if the Duke of Kent married, it was important\nto remember that he would be making a serious sacrifice: a lady was\ninvolved.\nThe Duke, reflecting upon all these matters with careful attention,\nhappened, about a month after his niece's death, to visit Brussels, and\nlearnt that Mr. Creevey was staying in the town. Mr. Creevey was a close\nfriend of the leading Whigs and an inveterate gossip; and it occurred\nto the Duke that there could be no better channel through which to\ncommunicate his views upon the situation to political circles at home.\nApparently it did not occur to him that Mr. Creevey was malicious and\nmight keep a diary. He therefore sent for him on some trivial pretext,\nand a remarkable conversation ensued.\nAfter referring to the death of the Princess, to the improbability of\nthe Regent's seeking a divorce, to the childlessness of the Duke of\nYork, and to the possibility of the Duke of Clarence marrying, the Duke\nadverted to his own position. \"Should the Duke of Clarence not marry,\"\nhe said, \"the next prince in succession is myself, and although I trust\nI shall be at all times ready to obey any call my country may make upon\nme, God only knows the sacrifice it will be to make, whenever I shall\nthink it my duty to become a married man. It is now seven and twenty\nyears that Madame St. Laurent and I have lived together: we are of\nthe same age, and have been in all climates, and in all difficulties\ntogether, and you may well imagine, Mr. Creevey, the pang it will\noccasion me to part with her. I put it to your own feelings--in the\nevent of any separation between you and Mrs. Creevey... As for Madame\nSt. Laurent herself, I protest I don't know what is to become of her if\na marriage is to be forced upon me; her feelings are already so agitated\nupon the subject.\" The Duke went on to describe how, one morning, a day\nor two after the Princess Charlotte's death, a paragraph had appeared in\nthe Morning Chronicle, alluding to the possibility of his marriage. He\nhad received the newspaper at breakfast together with his letters, and\n\"I did as is my constant practice, I threw the newspaper across the\ntable to Madame St. Laurent, and began to open and read my letters. I\nhad not done so but a very short time, when my attention was called to\nan extraordinary noise and a strong convulsive movement in Madame St.\nLaurent's throat. For a short time I entertained serious apprehensions\nfor her safety; and when, upon her recovery, I enquired into the\noccasion of this attack, she pointed to the article in the Morning\nChronicle.\"\nThe Duke then returned to the subject of the Duke of Clarence. \"My\nbrother the Duke of Clarence is the elder brother, and has certainly the\nright to marry if he chooses, and I would not interfere with him on any\naccount. If he wishes to be king--to be married and have children, poor\nman--God help him! Let him do so. For myself--I am a man of no ambition,\nand wish only to remain as I am... Easter, you know, falls very early\nthis year--the 22nd of March. If the Duke of Clarence does not take any\nstep before that time, I must find some pretext to reconcile Madame St.\nLaurent to my going to England for a short time. When once there, it\nwill be easy for me to consult with my friends as to the proper steps to\nbe taken. Should the Duke of Clarence do nothing before that time as to\nmarrying it will become my duty, no doubt, to take some measures upon\nthe subject myself.\" Two names, the Duke said, had been mentioned in\nthis connection--those of the Princess of Baden and the Princess of\nSaxe-Coburg. The latter, he thought, would perhaps be the better of the\ntwo, from the circumstance of Prince Leopold being so popular with the\nnation; but before any other steps were taken, he hoped and expected to\nsee justice done to Madame St. Laurent. \"She is,\" he explained, \"of very\ngood family, and has never been an actress, and I am the first and only\nperson who ever lived with her. Her disinterestedness, too, has been\nequal to her fidelity. When she first came to me it was upon L100 a\nyear. That sum was afterwards raised to L400 and finally to L1000; but\nwhen my debts made it necessary for me to sacrifice a great part of my\nincome, Madame St. Laurent insisted upon again returning to her income\nof L400 a year.

            "text": "The new Duchess of Kent, Victoria Mary Louisa, was a daughter of\nFrancis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and a sister of Prince Leopold.\nThe family was an ancient one, being a branch of the great House of\nWettin, which since the eleventh century had ruled over the March of\nMeissen on the Elbe. In the fifteenth century the whole possessions of\nthe House had been divided between the Albertine and Ernestine branches:\nfrom the former descended the electors and kings of Saxony; the latter,\nruling over Thuringia, became further subdivided into five branches,\nof which the duchy of Saxe-Coburg was one. This principality was very\nsmall, containing about 60,000 inhabitants, but it enjoyed independent\nand sovereign rights. During the disturbed years which followed the\nFrench Revolution, its affairs became terribly involved. The Duke was\nextravagant, and kept open house for the swarms of refugees, who fled\neastward over Germany as the French power advanced. Among these was the\nPrince of Leiningen, an elderly beau, whose domains on the Moselle\nhad been seized by the French, but who was granted in compensation\nthe territory of Amorbach in Lower Franconia. In 1803 he married the\nPrincess Victoria, at that time seventeen years of age. Three years\nlater Duke Francis died a ruined man. The Napoleonic harrow passed over\nSaxe-Coburg. The duchy was seized by the French, and the ducal family\nwere reduced to beggary, almost to starvation. At the same time the\nlittle principality of Amorbach was devastated by the French, Russian,\nand Austrian armies, marching and counter-marching across it. For years\nthere was hardly a cow in the country, nor enough grass to feed a\nflock of geese. Such was the desperate plight of the family which, a\ngeneration later, was to have gained a foothold in half the reigning\nHouses of Europe. The Napoleonic harrow had indeed done its work, the\nseed was planted; and the crop would have surprised Napoleon. Prince\nLeopold, thrown upon his own resources at fifteen, made a career for\nhimself and married the heiress of England. The Princess of Leiningen,\nstruggling at Amorbach with poverty, military requisitions, and a\nfutile husband, developed an independence of character and a tenacity of\npurpose which were to prove useful in very different circumstances. In\n1814, her husband died, leaving her with two children and the regency\nof the principality. After her brother's marriage with the Princess\nCharlotte, it was proposed that she should marry the Duke of Kent; but\nshe declined, on the ground that the guardianship of her children and\nthe management of her domains made other ties undesirable. The Princess\nCharlotte's death, however, altered the case; and when the Duke of Kent\nrenewed his offer, she accepted it. She was thirty-two years old--short,\nstout, with brown eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, cheerful and voluble,\nand gorgeously attired in rustling silks and bright velvets.\nShe was certainly fortunate in her contented disposition; for she was\nfated, all through her life, to have much to put up with. Her second\nmarriage, with its dubious prospects, seemed at first to be chiefly a\nsource of difficulties and discomforts. The Duke, declaring that he was\nstill too poor to live in England, moved about with uneasy precision\nthrough Belgium and Germany, attending parades and inspecting barracks\nin a neat military cap, while the English notabilities looked askance,\nand the Duke of Wellington dubbed him the Corporal. \"God damme!\" he\nexclaimed to Mr. Creevey, \"d'ye know what his sisters call him? By God!\nthey call him Joseph Surface!\" At Valenciennes, where there was a\nreview and a great dinner, the Duchess arrived with an old and\nugly lady-in-waiting, and the Duke of Wellington found himself in a\ndifficulty. \"Who the devil is to take out the maid of honour?\" he kept\nasking; but at last he thought of a solution. \"Damme, Freemantle, find\nout the mayor and let him do it.\" So the Mayor of Valenciennes was\nbrought up for the purpose, and--so we learn from Mr. Creevey--\"a\ncapital figure he was.\" A few days later, at Brussels, Mr. Creevey\nhimself had an unfortunate experience. A military school was to be\ninspected--before breakfast. The company assembled; everything was\nhighly satisfactory; but the Duke of Kent continued for so long\nexamining every detail and asking meticulous question after meticulous\nquestion, that Mr. Creevey at last could bear it no longer, and\nwhispered to his neighbour that he was damned hungry. The Duke of\nWellington heard him, and was delighted. \"I recommend you,\" he said,\n\"whenever you start with the royal family in a morning, and particularly\nwith THE CORPORAL, always to breakfast first.\" He and his staff, it\nturned out, had taken that precaution, and the great man amused himself,\nwhile the stream of royal inquiries poured on, by pointing at Mr.\nCreevey from time to time with the remark, \"Voila le monsieur qui n'a\npas dejeune!\"\nSettled down at last at Amorbach, the time hung heavily on the Duke's\nhands. The establishment was small, the country was impoverished; even\nclock-making grew tedious at last. He brooded--for in spite of his piety\nthe Duke was not without a vein of superstition--over the prophecy of\na gipsy at Gibraltar who told him that he was to have many losses and\ncrosses, that he was to die in happiness, and that his only child was\nto be a great queen. Before long it became clear that a child was to be\nexpected: the Duke decided that it should be born in England. Funds were\nlacking for the journey, but his determination was not to be set aside.\nCome what might, he declared, his child must be English-born. A carriage\nwas hired, and the Duke himself mounted the box. Inside were the\nDuchess, her daughter Feodora, a girl of fourteen, with maids, nurses,\nlap-dogs, and canaries. Off they drove--through Germany, through\nFrance: bad roads, cheap inns, were nothing to the rigorous Duke and the\nequable, abundant Duchess. The Channel was crossed, London was reached\nin safety. The authorities provided a set of rooms in Kensington Palace;\nand there, on May 24, 1819, a female infant was born.",

She did so, and there were no\nmore difficulties. Drina learnt her letters like an angel; and she\nlearnt other things as well. The Baroness de Spath taught her how\nto make little board boxes and decorate them with tinsel and painted\nflowers; her mother taught her religion. Sitting in the pew every Sunday\nmorning, the child of six was seen listening in rapt attention to the\nclergyman's endless sermon, for she was to be examined upon it in\nthe afternoon. The Duchess was determined that her daughter, from the\nearliest possible moment, should be prepared for her high station in a\nway that would commend itself to the most respectable; her good,\nplain, thrifty German mind recoiled with horror and amazement from the\nshameless junketings at Carlton House; Drina should never be allowed to\nforget for a moment the virtues of simplicity, regularity, propriety,\nand devotion.

Three years later George IV also disappeared, and the Duke of\nClarence reigned in his stead. The new Queen, it was now clear, would\nin all probability never again be a mother; the Princess Victoria,\ntherefore, was recognised by Parliament as heir-presumptive; and the\nDuchess of Kent, whose annuity had been doubled five years previously,\nwas now given an additional L10,000 for the maintenance of the Princess,\nand was appointed regent, in case of the death of the King before the\nmajority of her daughter. At the same time a great convulsion took\nplace in the constitution of the State. The power of the Tories, who had\ndominated England for more than forty years, suddenly began to crumble.\nIn the tremendous struggle that followed, it seemed for a moment as if\nthe tradition of generations might be snapped, as if the blind tenacity\nof the reactionaries and the determined fury of their enemies could have\nno other issue than revolution. But the forces of compromise triumphed:\nthe Reform Bill was passed. The centre of gravity in the constitution\nwas shifted towards the middle classes; the Whigs came into power; and\nthe complexion of the Government assumed a Liberal tinge. One of the\nresults of this new state of affairs was a change in the position of\nthe Duchess of Kent and her daughter. From being the protegees of an\nopposition clique, they became assets of the official majority of the\nnation. The Princess Victoria was henceforward the living symbol of the\nvictory of the middle classes.",

She herself had no pretensions to\ncleverness; she did not understand very much about the Poor Law and the\nSlave Trade and Political Economy; but she hoped that she did her\nduty; and she hoped--she ardently hoped--that the same might be said of\nVictoria. Her educational conceptions were those of Dr. Arnold, whose\nviews were just then beginning to permeate society. Dr. Arnold's object\nwas, first and foremost, to make his pupils \"in the highest and truest\nsense of the words, Christian gentlemen,\" intellectual refinements might\nfollow. The Duchess felt convinced that it was her supreme duty in life\nto make quite sure that her daughter should grow up into a Christian\nqueen. To this task she bent all her energies; and, as the child\ndeveloped, she flattered herself that her efforts were not unsuccessful.\nWhen the Princess was eleven, she desired the Bishops of London and\nLincoln to submit her daughter to an examination, and report upon the\nprogress that had been made. \"I feel the time to be now come,\" the\nDuchess explained, in a letter obviously drawn up by her own hand, \"that\nwhat has been done should be put to some test, that if anything has been\ndone in error of judgment it may be corrected, and that the plan for the\nfuture should be open to consideration and revision... I attend almost\nalways myself every lesson, or a part; and as the lady about the\nPrincess is a competent person, she assists Her in preparing Her\nlessons, for the various masters, as I resolved to act in that manner\nso as to be Her Governess myself.

            "text": "King William could not away with his sister-in-law, and the Duchess\nfully returned his antipathy. Without considerable tact and considerable\nforbearance their relative positions were well calculated to cause\nill-feeling; and there was very little tact in the composition of the\nDuchess, and no forbearance at all in that of his Majesty. A bursting,\nbubbling old gentleman, with quarterdeck gestures, round rolling eyes,\nand a head like a pineapple, his sudden elevation to the throne after\nfifty-six years of utter insignificance had almost sent him crazy. His\nnatural exuberance completely got the best of him; he rushed about doing\npreposterous things in an extraordinary manner, spreading amusement\nand terror in every direction, and talking all the time. His tongue\nwas decidedly Hanoverian, with its repetitions, its catchwords--\"That's\nquite another thing! That's quite another thing!\"--its rattling\nindomitability, its loud indiscreetness. His speeches, made repeatedly\nat the most inopportune junctures, and filled pell-mell with all the\nfancies and furies that happened at the moment to be whisking about\nin his head, were the consternation of Ministers. He was one part\nblackguard, people said, and three parts buffoon; but those who knew\nhim better could not help liking him--he meant well; and he was really\ngood-humoured and kind-hearted, if you took him the right way. If you\ntook him the wrong way, however, you must look out for squalls, as the\nDuchess of Kent discovered.\nShe had no notion of how to deal with him--could not understand him in\nthe least. Occupied with her own position, her own responsibilities, her\nduty, and her daughter, she had no attention to spare for the peppery\nsusceptibilities of a foolish, disreputable old man. She was the mother\nof the heiress of England; and it was for him to recognise the fact--to\nput her at once upon a proper footing--to give her the precedence of a\ndowager Princess of Wales, with a large annuity from the privy purse.\nIt did not occur to her that such pretensions might be galling to a king\nwho had no legitimate child of his own, and who yet had not altogether\nabandoned the hope of having one. She pressed on, with bulky vigour,\nalong the course she had laid out. Sir John Conroy, an Irishman with\nno judgment and a great deal of self-importance, was her intimate\ncounsellor, and egged her on. It was advisable that Victoria should\nbecome acquainted with the various districts of England, and through\nseveral summers a succession of tours--in the West, in the Midlands, in\nWales--were arranged for her. The intention of the plan was excellent,\nbut its execution was unfortunate. The journeys, advertised in\nthe Press, attracting enthusiastic crowds, and involving official\nreceptions, took on the air of royal progresses. Addresses were\npresented by loyal citizens, the delighted Duchess, swelling in sweeping\nfeathers and almost obliterating the diminutive Princess, read aloud,\nin her German accent, gracious replies prepared beforehand by Sir\nJohn, who, bustling and ridiculous, seemed to be mingling the roles\nof major-domo and Prime Minister. Naturally the King fumed over his\nnewspaper at Windsor. \"That woman is a nuisance!\" he exclaimed. Poor\nQueen Adelaide, amiable though disappointed, did her best to smooth\nthings down, changed the subject, and wrote affectionate letters to\nVictoria; but it was useless. News arrived that the Duchess of Kent,\nsailing in the Solent, had insisted that whenever her yacht appeared it\nshould be received by royal salutes from all the men-of-war and all the\nforts. The King declared that these continual poppings must cease; the\nPremier and the First Lord of the Admiralty were consulted; and they\nwrote privately to the Duchess, begging her to waive her rights. But\nshe would not hear of it; Sir John Conroy was adamant. \"As her Royal\nHighness's CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER,\" he said, \"I cannot recommend her\nto give way on this point.\" Eventually the King, in a great state of\nexcitement, issued a special Order in Council, prohibiting the firing\nof royal salutes to any ships except those which carried the reigning\nsovereign or his consort on board.\nWhen King William quarrelled with his Whig Ministers the situation grew\nstill more embittered, for now the Duchess, in addition to her other\nshortcomings, was the political partisan of his enemies. In 1836 he\nmade an attempt to prepare the ground for a match between the Princess\nVictoria and one of the sons of the Prince of Orange, and at the same\ntime did his best to prevent the visit of the young Coburg princes to\nKensington. He failed in both these objects; and the only result of\nhis efforts was to raise the anger of the King of the Belgians, who,\nforgetting for a moment his royal reserve, addressed an indignant letter\non the subject to his niece. \"I am really ASTONISHED,\" he wrote, \"at\nthe conduct of your old Uncle the King; this invitation of the Prince\nof Orange and his sons, this forcing him on others, is very\nextraordinary... Not later than yesterday I got a half-official\ncommunication from England, insinuating that it would be HIGHLY\ndesirable that the visit of YOUR relatives SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE\nTHIS YEAR--qu'en dites-vous? The relations of the Queen and the King,\ntherefore, to the God-knows-what degree, are to come in shoals and rule\nthe land, when YOUR RELATIONS are to be FORBIDDEN the country, and\nthat when, as you know, the whole of your relations have ever been very\ndutiful and kind to the King. Really and truly I never heard or saw\nanything like it, and I hope it will a LITTLE ROUSE YOUR SPIRIT;\nnow that slavery is even abolished in the British Colonies, I do not\ncomprehend WHY YOUR LOT ALONE SHOULD BE TO BE KEPT A WHITE LITTLE SLAVEY\nIN ENGLAND, for the pleasure of the Court, who never bought you, as I am\nnot aware of their ever having gone to any expense on that head, or\nthe King's ever having SPENT A SIXPENCE FOR YOUR EXISTENCE... Oh,\nconsistency and political or OTHER HONESTY, where must one look for\nyou!\"\nShortly afterwards King Leopold came to England himself, and his\nreception was as cold at Windsor as it was warm at Kensington. \"To hear\ndear Uncle speak on any subject,\" the Princess wrote in her diary,\n\"is like reading a highly instructive book; his conversation is so\nenlightened, so clear. He is universally admitted to be one of the first\npoliticians now extant. He speaks so mildly, yet firmly and impartially,\nabout politics. Uncle tells me that Belgium is quite a pattern for its\norganisation, its industry, and prosperity; the finances are in the\ngreatest perfection. Uncle is so beloved and revered by his Belgian\nsubjects, that it must be a great compensation for all his extreme\ntrouble.\" But her other uncle by no means shared her sentiments. He\ncould not, he said, put up with a water-drinker; and King Leopold would\ntouch no wine. \"What's that you're drinking, sir?\" he asked him one day\nat dinner. \"Water, sir.\" \"God damn it, sir!\" was the rejoinder. \"Why\ndon't you drink wine? I never allow anybody to drink water at my table.\"\nIt was clear that before very long there would be a great explosion; and\nin the hot days of August it came. The Duchess and the Princess had\ngone down to stay at Windsor for the King's birthday party, and the King\nhimself, who was in London for the day to prorogue Parliament, paid a\nvisit at Kensington Palace in their absence. There he found that the\nDuchess had just appropriated, against his express orders, a suite of\nseventeen apartments for her own use. He was extremely angry, and, when\nhe returned to Windsor, after greeting the Princess with affection, he\npublicly rebuked the Duchess for what she had done. But this was little\nto what followed. On the next day was the birthday banquet; there were\na hundred guests; the Duchess of Kent sat on the King's right hand, and\nthe Princess Victoria opposite. At the end of the dinner, in reply\nto the toast of the King's health, he rose, and, in a long, loud,\npassionate speech, poured out the vials of his wrath upon the Duchess.\nShe had, he declared, insulted him--grossly and continually; she had\nkept the Princess away from him in the most improper manner; she was\nsurrounded by evil advisers, and was incompetent to act with propriety\nin the high station which she filled; but he would bear it no longer; he\nwould have her to know he was King; he was determined that his authority\nshould be respected; henceforward the Princess should attend at every\nCourt function with the utmost regularity; and he hoped to God that his\nlife might be spared for six months longer, so that the calamity of a\nregency might be avoided, and the functions of the Crown pass directly\nto the heiress-presumptive instead of into the hands of the \"person now\nnear him,\" upon whose conduct and capacity no reliance whatever could\nbe placed. The flood of vituperation rushed on for what seemed an\ninterminable period, while the Queen blushed scarlet, the Princess burst\ninto tears, and the hundred guests sat aghast. The Duchess said not a\nword until the tirade was over and the company had retired; then in\na tornado of rage and mortification, she called for her carriage and\nannounced her immediate return to Kensington. It was only with the\nutmost difficulty that some show of a reconciliation was patched up, and\nthe outraged lady was prevailed upon to put off her departure till the\nmorrow.",

He\nrecovered, however, and the Princess was able to go through her\nbirthday festivities--a state ball and a drawing-room--with unperturbed\nenjoyment. \"Count Zichy,\" she noted in her diary, \"is very good-looking\nin uniform, but not in plain clothes. Count Waldstein looks remarkably\nwell in his pretty Hungarian uniform.\" With the latter young gentleman\nshe wished to dance, but there was an insurmountable difficulty. \"He\ncould not dance quadrilles, and, as in my station I unfortunately cannot\nvalse and gallop, I could not dance with him.\" Her birthday present\nfrom the King was of a pleasing nature, but it led to a painful domestic\nscene. In spite of the anger of her Belgian uncle, she had remained upon\ngood terms with her English one. He had always been very kind to her,\nand the fact that he had quarrelled with her mother did not appear to\nbe a reason for disliking him. He was, she said, \"odd, very odd and\nsingular,\" but \"his intentions were often ill interpreted.\" He now wrote\nher a letter, offering her an allowance of L10,000 a year, which he\nproposed should be at her own disposal, and independent of her mother.\nLord Conyngham, the Lord Chamberlain, was instructed to deliver the\nletter into the Princess's own hands. When he arrived at Kensington, he\nwas ushered into the presence of the Duchess and the Princess, and, when\nhe produced the letter, the Duchess put out her hand to take it. Lord\nConyngham begged her Royal Highness's pardon, and repeated the King's\ncommands. Thereupon the Duchess drew back, and the Princess took the\nletter. She immediately wrote to her uncle, accepting his kind proposal.\nThe Duchess was much displeased; L4000 a year, she said, would be quite\nenough for Victoria; as for the remaining L6000, it would be only proper\nthat she should have that herself.\nKing William had thrown off his illness, and returned to his normal\nlife. Once more the royal circle at Windsor--their Majesties, the elder\nPrincesses, and some unfortunate Ambassadress or Minister's wife--might\nbe seen ranged for hours round a mahogany table, while the Queen netted\na purse, and the King slept, occasionally waking from his slumbers to\nobserve \"Exactly so, ma'am, exactly so!\" But this recovery was of short\nduration. The old man suddenly collapsed; with no specific symptoms\nbesides an extreme weakness, he yet showed no power of rallying; and it\nwas clear to everyone that his death was now close at hand.",

At six the Duchess woke up\nher daughter, and told her that the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord\nConyngham were there, and wished to see her. She got out of bed, put on\nher dressing-gown, and went, alone, into the room where the messengers\nwere standing. Lord Conyngham fell on his knees, and officially\nannounced the death of the King; the Archbishop added some personal\ndetails. Looking at the bending, murmuring dignitaries before her, she\nknew that she was Queen of England. \"Since it has pleased Providence,\"\nshe wrote that day in her journal, \"to place me in this station, I shall\ndo my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young, and\nperhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am sure,\nthat very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what\nis fit and right than I have.\" But there was scant time for resolutions\nand reflections.

A letter came from\nthe Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, announcing his approaching arrival.\nHe came at nine, in full court dress, and kissed her hand. She saw him\nalone, and repeated to him the lesson which, no doubt, the faithful\nStockmar had taught her at breakfast. \"It has long been my intention to\nretain your Lordship and the rest of the present Ministry at the head\nof affairs;\" whereupon Lord Melbourne again kissed her hand and shortly\nafter left her. She then wrote a letter of condolence to Queen Adelaide.\nAt eleven, Lord Melbourne came again; and at half-past eleven she went\ndownstairs into the red saloon to hold her first Council. The great\nassembly of lords and notables, bishops, generals, and Ministers of\nState, saw the doors thrown open and a very short, very slim girl in\ndeep plain mourning come into the room alone and move forward to her\nseat with extraordinary dignity and grace; they saw a countenance, not\nbeautiful, but prepossessing--fair hair, blue prominent eyes, a small\ncurved nose, an open mouth revealing the upper teeth, a tiny chin,\na clear complexion, and, over all, the strangely mingled signs of\ninnocence, of gravity, of youth, and of composure; they heard a high\nunwavering voice reading aloud with perfect clarity; and then, the\nceremony was over, they saw the small figure rise and, with the same\nconsummate grace, the same amazing dignity, pass out from among them, as\nshe had come in, alone.\nCHAPTER",

            "text": "The new queen was almost entirely unknown to her subjects. In her public\nappearances her mother had invariably dominated the scene. Her private\nlife had been that of a novice in a convent: hardly a human being from\nthe outside world had ever spoken to her; and no human being at all,\nexcept her mother and the Baroness Lehzen, had ever been alone with\nher in a room. Thus it was not only the public at large that was in\nignorance of everything concerning her; the inner circles of statesmen\nand officials and high-born ladies were equally in the dark. When she\nsuddenly emerged from this deep obscurity, the impression that she\ncreated was immediate and profound. Her bearing at her first Council\nfilled the whole gathering with astonishment and admiration; the Duke of\nWellington, Sir Robert Peel, even the savage Croker, even the cold and\ncaustic Greville--all were completely carried away. Everything that was\nreported of her subsequent proceedings seemed to be of no less happy\naugury. Her perceptions were quick, her decisions were sensible, her\nlanguage was discreet; she performed her royal duties with extraordinary\nfacility. Among the outside public there was a great wave of enthusiasm.\nSentiment and romance were coming into fashion; and the spectacle of\nthe little girl-queen, innocent, modest, with fair hair and pink cheeks,\ndriving through her capital, filled the hearts of the beholders with\nraptures of affectionate loyalty. What, above all, struck everybody\nwith overwhelming force was the contrast between Queen Victoria and\nher uncles. The nasty old men, debauched and selfish, pig-headed and\nridiculous, with their perpetual burden of debts, confusions, and\ndisreputabilities--they had vanished like the snows of winter, and here\nat last, crowned and radiant, was the spring. Lord John Russell, in an\nelaborate oration, gave voice to the general sentiment. He hoped that\nVictoria might prove an Elizabeth without her tyranny, an Anne without\nher weakness. He asked England to pray that the illustrious Princess who\nhad just ascended the throne with the purest intentions and the justest\ndesires might see slavery abolished, crime diminished, and education\nimproved. He trusted that her people would henceforward derive their\nstrength, their conduct, and their loyalty from enlightened religious\nand moral principles, and that, so fortified, the reign of Victoria\nmight prove celebrated to posterity and to all the nations of the earth.",

No doubt it was true that technically she\ntook no part in public business; but the distinction between what is\npublic and what is private is always a subtle one; and in the case of\na reigning sovereign--as the next few years were to show--it is often\nimaginary.

During the twenty years which had elapsed since the death of the\nPrincess Charlotte, his experiences had been varied and remarkable. The\nunknown counsellor of a disappointed princeling had gradually risen to a\nposition of European importance. His devotion to his master had been not\nonly whole--hearted but cautious and wise. It was Stockmar's advice\nthat had kept Prince Leopold in England during the critical years which\nfollowed his wife's death, and had thus secured to him the essential\nrequisite of a point d'appui in the country of his adoption. It was\nStockmar's discretion which had smoothed over the embarrassments\nsurrounding the Prince's acceptance and rejection of the Greek crown.\nIt was Stockmar who had induced the Prince to become the constitutional\nSovereign of Belgium. Above all, it was Stockmar's tact, honesty, and\ndiplomatic skill which, through a long series of arduous and complicated\nnegotiations, had led to the guarantee of Belgian neutrality by the\nGreat Powers. His labours had been rewarded by a German barony and by\nthe complete confidence of King Leopold. Nor was it only in Brussels\nthat he was treated with respect and listened to with attention.\nThe statesmen who governed England--Lord Grey, Sir Robert Peel, Lord\nPalmerston, Lord Melbourne--had learnt to put a high value upon his\nprobity and his intelligence. \"He is one of the cleverest fellows I\never saw,\" said Lord Melbourne, \"the most discreet man, the most\nwell-judging, and most cool man.\" And Lord Palmerston cited Baron\nStockmar as the only absolutely disinterested man he had come across in\nlife, At last he was able to retire to Coburg, and to enjoy for a few\nyears the society of the wife and children whom his labours in the\nservice of his master had hitherto only allowed him to visit at long\nintervals for a month or two at a time. But in 1836 he had been again\nentrusted with an important negotiation, which he had brought to\na successful conclusion in the marriage of Prince Ferdinand of\nSaxe-Coburg, a nephew of King Leopold's, with Queen Maria II of\nPortugal.

But, indeed, why should there be any\nquestion of resisting? Was not such a course of conduct, far from being\na temptation, simply \"selon les regles?\" What were royal marriages\nfor, if they did not enable sovereigns, in spite of the hindrances of\nconstitutions, to control foreign politics? For the highest purposes,\nof course; that was understood. The Queen of England was his niece--more\nthan that--almost his daughter; his confidential agent was living, in\na position of intimate favour, at her court. Surely, in such\ncircumstances, it would be preposterous, it would be positively\nincorrect, to lose the opportunity of bending to his wishes by means\nof personal influence, behind the backs of the English Ministers, the\nforeign policy of England.\nHe set about the task with becoming precautions. He continued in his\nletters his admirable advice. Within a few days of her accession, he\nrecommended the young Queen to lay emphasis, on every possible occasion,\nupon her English birth; to praise the English nation; \"the Established\nChurch I also recommend strongly; you cannot, without PLEDGING yourself\nto anything PARTICULAR, SAY TOO MUCH ON THE SUBJECT.\" And then \"before\nyou decide on anything important I should be glad if you would consult\nme; this would also have the advantage of giving you time;\" nothing was\nmore injurious than to be hurried into wrong decisions unawares. His\nniece replied at once with all the accustomed warmth of her affection;\nbut she wrote hurriedly--and, perhaps, a trifle vaguely too. \"YOUR\nadvice is always of the GREATEST IMPORTANCE to me,\" she said.\nHad he, possibly, gone too far? He could not be certain; perhaps\nVictoria HAD been hurried. In any case, he would be careful; he would\ndraw back--\"pour mieux sauter\" he added to himself with a smile. In his\nnext letters he made no reference to his suggestion of consultations\nwith himself; he merely pointed out the wisdom, in general, of refusing\nto decide upon important questions off-hand. So far, his advice was\ntaken; and it was noticed that the Queen, when applications were made to\nher, rarely gave an immediate answer. Even with Lord Melbourne, it was\nthe same; when he asked for her opinion upon any subject, she would\nreply that she would think it over, and tell him her conclusions next\nday.\nKing Leopold's counsels continued. The Princess de Lieven, he said,\nwas a dangerous woman; there was reason to think that she would make\nattempts to pry into what did not concern her, let Victoria beware. \"A\nrule which I cannot sufficiently recommend is NEVER TO PERMIT people\nto speak on subjects concerning yourself or your affairs, without you\nhaving yourself desired them to do so.\" Should such a thing occur,\n\"change the conversation, and make the individual feel that he has made\na mistake.\" This piece of advice was also taken; for it fell out as the\nKing had predicted. Madame de Lieven sought an audience, and appeared\nto be verging towards confidential topics; whereupon the Queen, becoming\nslightly embarrassed, talked of nothing but commonplaces. The individual\nfelt that she had made a mistake.\nThe King's next warning was remarkable. Letters, he pointed out, are\nalmost invariably read in the post. This was inconvenient, no doubt; but\nthe fact, once properly grasped, was not without its advantages. \"I will\ngive you an example: we are still plagued by Prussia concerning those\nfortresses; now to tell the Prussian Government many things, which we\nSHOULD NOT LIKE to tell them officially, the Minister is going to write\na despatch to our man at Berlin, sending it BY POST; the Prussians ARE\nSURE to read it, and to learn in this way what we wish them to hear.\nAnalogous circumstances might very probably occur in England. I tell you\nthe TRICK,\" wrote His Majesty, \"that you should be able to guard against\nit.\" Such were the subtleties of constitutional sovereignty.",

The King's next\nletter was full of foreign politics--the situation in Spain and\nPortugal, the character of Louis Philippe; and he received a favourable\nanswer. Victoria, it is true, began by saying that she had shown the\nPOLITICAL PART of his letter to Lord Melbourne; but she proceeded to a\ndiscussion of foreign affairs. It appeared that she was not unwilling\nto exchange observations on such matters with her uncle. So far so good.\nBut King Leopold was still cautious; though a crisis was impending\nin his diplomacy, he still hung back; at last, however, he could keep\nsilence no longer. It was of the utmost importance to him that, in his\nmanoeuvrings with France and Holland, he should have, or at any rate\nappear to have, English support. But the English Government appeared to\nadopt a neutral attitude; it was too bad; not to be for him was to\nbe against him, could they not see that? Yet, perhaps, they were only\nwavering, and a little pressure upon them from Victoria might still\nsave all. He determined to put the case before her, delicately yet\nforcibly--just as he saw it himself. \"All I want from your kind\nMajesty,\" he wrote, \"is, that you will OCCASIONALLY express to your\nMinisters, and particularly to good Lord Melbourne, that, as far as it\nis COMPATIBLE with the interests of your own dominions, you do NOT wish\nthat your Government should take the lead in such measures as might in a\nshort time bring on the DESTRUCTION of this country, as well as that of\nyour uncle and his family.\" The result of this appeal was unexpected;\nthere was dead silence for more than a week. When Victoria at last\nwrote, she was prodigal of her affection. \"It would, indeed, my dearest\nUncle, be VERY WRONG of you, if you thought my feelings of warm and\ndevoted attachment to you, and of great affection for you, could be\nchanged--nothing can ever change them\"--but her references to foreign\npolitics, though they were lengthy and elaborate, were non-committal in\nthe extreme; they were almost cast in an official and diplomatic form.\nHer Ministers, she said, entirely shared her views upon the subject; she\nunderstood and sympathised with the difficulties of her beloved uncle's\nposition; and he might rest assured \"that both Lord Melbourne and Lord\nPalmerston are most anxious at all times for the prosperity and welfare\nof Belgium.\" That was all. The King in his reply declared himself\ndelighted, and re-echoed the affectionate protestations of his niece.\n\"My dearest and most beloved Victoria,\" he said, \"you have written me\na VERY DEAR and long letter, which has given me GREAT PLEASURE AND\nSATISFACTION.\" He would not admit that he had had a rebuff.",

King Leopold determined to make a\nbold push, and to carry Victoria with him, this time, by a display of\nroyal vigour and avuncular authority. In an abrupt, an almost peremptory\nletter, he laid his case, once more, before his niece. \"You know from\nexperience,\" he wrote, \"that I NEVER ASK ANYTHING OF YOU... But, as I\nsaid before, if we are not careful we may see serious consequences which\nmay affect more or less everybody, and THIS ought to be the object\nof our most anxious attention. I remain, my dear Victoria, your\naffectionate uncle, Leopold R.\" The Queen immediately despatched this\nletter to Lord Melbourne, who replied with a carefully thought-out form\nof words, signifying nothing whatever, which, he suggested, she should\nsend to her uncle. She did so, copying out the elaborate formula, with a\nliberal scattering of \"dear Uncles\" interspersed; and she concluded\nher letter with a message of \"affectionate love to Aunt Louise and the\nchildren.\" Then at last King Leopold was obliged to recognise the facts.\nHis next letter contained no reference at all to politics. \"I am glad,\"\nhe wrote, \"to find that you like Brighton better than last year. I think\nBrighton very agreeable at this time of the year, till the east winds\nset in. The pavilion, besides, is comfortable; that cannot be denied.\nBefore my marriage, it was there that I met the Regent. Charlotte\nafterwards came with old Queen Charlotte. How distant all this already,\nbut still how present to one's memory.\" Like poor Madame de Lieven, His\nMajesty felt that he had made a mistake.\nNevertheless, he could not quite give up all hope. Another opportunity\noffered, and he made another effort--but there was not very much\nconviction in it, and it was immediately crushed. \"My dear Uncle,\" the\nQueen wrote, \"I have to thank you for your last letter which I received\non Sunday. Though you seem not to dislike my political sparks, I think\nit is better not to increase them, as they might finally take fire,\nparticularly as I see with regret that upon this one subject we cannot\nagree.

Ever since the\npassage of the Reform Bill, the power of the Whig Government had\nsteadily declined. The General Election of 1837 had left them with a\nvery small majority in the House of Commons; since then, they had been\nin constant difflculties--abroad, at home, in Ireland; the Radical group\nhad grown hostile; it became highly doubtful how much longer they could\nsurvive. The Queen watched the development of events in great anxiety.\nShe was a Whig by birth, by upbringing, by every association, public and\nprivate; and, even if those ties had never existed, the mere fact that\nLord M. was the head of the Whigs would have amply sufficed to determine\nher politics. The fall of the Whigs would mean a sad upset for Lord M.\nBut it would have a still more terrible consequence: Lord M. would have\nto leave her; and the daily, the hourly, presence of Lord M. had become\nan integral part of her life. Six months after her accession she had\nnoted in her diary \"I shall be very sorry to lose him even for one\nnight;\" and this feeling of personal dependence on her Minister steadily\nincreased. In these circumstances it was natural that she should have\nbecome a Whig partisan. Of the wider significance of political questions\nshe knew nothing; all she saw was that her friends were in office and\nabout her, and that it would be dreadful if they ceased to be so. \"I\ncannot say,\" she wrote when a critical division was impending, \"(though\nI feel confident of our success) how low, how sad I feel, when I think\nof the possibility of this excellent and truly kind man not remaining my\nMinister! Yet I trust fervently that He who has so wonderfully protected\nme through such manifold difficulties will not now desert me! I should\nhave liked to have expressed to Lord M. my anxiety, but the tears were\nnearer than words throughout the time I saw him, and I felt I should\nhave choked, had I attempted to say anything.\" Lord Melbourne\nrealised clearly enough how undesirable was such a state of mind in\na constitutional sovereign who might be called upon at any moment to",

Sir Robert's face worked strangely; he could not\nconceal his agitation. \"The Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of\nthe Bedchamber?\" he brought out at last. \"All,\" replied once more her\nMajesty. It was in vain that Peel pleaded and argued; in vain that\nhe spoke, growing every moment more pompous and uneasy, of the\nconstitution, and Queens Regnant, and the public interest; in vain that\nhe danced his pathetic minuet. She was adamant; but he, too, through all\nhis embarrassment, showed no sign of yielding; and when at last he left\nher nothing had been decided--the whole formation of the Government was\nhanging in the wind. A frenzy of excitement now seized upon Victoria.\nSir Robert, she believed in her fury, had tried to outwit her, to take\nher friends from her, to impose his will upon her own; but that was\nnot all: she had suddenly perceived, while the poor man was moving so\nuneasily before her, the one thing that she was desperately longing\nfor--a loop-hole of escape. She seized a pen and dashed off a note to\nLord Melbourne.\n\"Sir Robert has behaved very ill,\" she wrote, \"he insisted on my giving\nup my Ladies, to which I replied that I never would consent, and I never\nsaw a man so frightened... I was calm but very decided, and I think\nyou would have been pleased to see my composure and great firmness;\nthe Queen of England will not submit to such trickery.

And firm she was. The venerable conqueror\nof Napoleon was outfaced by the relentless equanimity of a girl in her\nteens. He could not move the Queen one inch. At last, she even ventured\nto rally him. \"Is Sir Robert so weak,\" she asked, \"that even the Ladies\nmust be of his opinion?\" On which the Duke made a brief and humble\nexpostulation, bowed low, and departed.\nHad she won? Time would show; and in the meantime she scribbled down\nanother letter. \"Lord Melbourne must not think the Queen rash in her\nconduct... The Queen felt this was an attempt to see whether she could\nbe led and managed like a child.\"(*) The Tories were not only wicked but\nridiculous. Peel, having, as she understood, expressed a wish to remove\nonly those members of the Household who were in Parliament, now objected\nto her Ladies. \"I should like to know,\" she exclaimed in triumphant\nscorn, \"if they mean to give the Ladies seats in Parliament?\"",

            "text": "Happiness had returned with Lord M., but it was happiness in the midst\nof agitation. The domestic imbroglio continued unabated, until at last\nthe Duke, rejected as a Minister, was called in once again in his old\ncapacity as moral physician to the family. Something was accomplished\nwhen, at last, he induced Sir John Conroy to resign his place about the\nDuchess of Kent and leave the Palace for ever; something more when he\npersuaded the Queen to write an affectionate letter to her mother. The\nway seemed open for a reconciliation, but the Duchess was stormy still.\nShe didn't believe that Victoria had written that letter; it was not\nin her handwriting; and she sent for the Duke to tell him so. The Duke,\nassuring her that the letter was genuine, begged her to forget the past.\nBut that was not so easy. \"What am I to do if Lord Melbourne comes up to\nme?\" \"Do, ma'am? Why, receive him with civility.\" Well, she would make\nan effort... \"But what am I to do if Victoria asks me to shake hands\nwith Lehzen?\" \"Do, ma'am? Why, take her in your arms and kiss her.\"\n\"What!\" The Duchess bristled in every feather, and then she burst into\na hearty laugh. \"No, ma'am, no,\" said the Duke, laughing too. \"I don't\nmean you are to take Lehzen in your arms and kiss her, but the\nQueen.\" The Duke might perhaps have succeeded, had not all attempts at\nconciliation been rendered hopeless by a tragical event. Lady Flora,\nit was discovered, had been suffering from a terrible internal malady,\nwhich now grew rapidly worse. There could be little doubt that she was\ndying. The Queen's unpopularity reached an extraordinary height. More\nthan once she was publicly insulted. \"Mrs. Melbourne,\" was shouted at\nher when she appeared at her balcony; and, at Ascot, she was hissed\nby the Duchess of Montrose and Lady Sarah Ingestre as she passed. Lady\nFlora died. The whole scandal burst out again with redoubled vehemence;\nwhile, in the Palace, the two parties were henceforth divided by an\nimpassable, a Stygian, gulf.\nNevertheless, Lord M. was back, and every trouble faded under the\nenchantment of his presence and his conversation. He, on his side,\nhad gone through much; and his distresses were intensified by a\nconsciousness of his own shortcomings. He realised clearly enough that,\nif he had intervened at the right moment, the Hastings scandal might\nhave been averted; and, in the bedchamber crisis, he knew that he had\nallowed his judgment to be overruled and his conduct to be swayed by\nprivate feelings and the impetuosity of Victoria. But he was not one\nto suffer too acutely from the pangs of conscience. In spite of the\ndullness and the formality of the Court, his relationship with the\nQueen had come to be the dominating interest in his life; to have been\ndeprived of it would have been heartrending; that dread eventuality\nhad been--somehow--avoided; he was installed once more, in a kind of\ntriumph; let him enjoy the fleeting hours to the full! And so, cherished\nby the favour of a sovereign and warmed by the adoration of a girl,\nthe autumn rose, in those autumn months of 1839, came to a wondrous\nblooming. The petals expanded, beautifully, for the last time. For",

Dr. Jacobi, the Court chaplain, presided at\nan altar, simply but appropriately decorated, which had been placed at\nthe end of the hall; and the proceedings began by the choir singing the\nfirst verse of the hymn, \"Come, Holy Ghost.\" After some introductory\nremarks, Dr. Jacobi began the examination. \"The dignified and decorous\nbearing of the Princes,\" we are told in a contemporary account,\n\"their strict attention to the questions, the frankness, decision, and\ncorrectness of their answers, produced a deep impression on the numerous\nassembly. Nothing was more striking in their answers than the evidence\nthey gave of deep feeling and of inward strength of conviction. The\nquestions put by the examiner were not such as to be met by a simple\n'yes' or 'no.' They were carefully considered in order to give the\naudience a clear insight into the views and feelings of,the young\nprinces. One of the most touching moments was when the examiner asked\nthe hereditary prince whether he intended steadfastly to hold to the\nEvangelical Church, and the Prince answered not only 'Yes!' but added in\na clear and decided tone: 'I and my brother are firmly resolved ever\nto remain faithful to the acknowledged truth.' The examination having\nlasted an hour, Dr. Jacobi made some concluding observations, followed\nby a short prayer; the second and third verses of the opening hymn were\nsung; and the ceremony was over. The Princes, stepping down from the\naltar, were embraced by the Duke and the Dowager Duchess; after which\nthe loyal inhabitants of Coburg dispersed, well satisfied with their\nentertainment.\"",

The Baron had been already, two years previously, consulted\nby King Leopold as to his views upon the proposed marriage of Albert\nand Victoria. His reply had been remarkable. With a characteristic\nforesight, a characteristic absence of optimism, a characteristic sense\nof the moral elements in the situation, Stockmar had pointed out what\nwere, in his opinion, the conditions essential to make the marriage a\nsuccess. Albert, he wrote, \"was a fine young fellow, well grown for his\nage, with agreeable and valuable qualities; and it was probable that\nin a few years he would turn out a strong handsome man, of a kindly,\nsimple, yet dignified demeanour. Thus, externally, he possesses\nall that pleases the sex, and at all times and in all countries must\nplease.\" Supposing, therefore, that Victoria herself was in favour of\nthe marriage, the further question arose as to whether Albert's mental\nqualities were such as to fit him for the position of husband of the\nQueen of England. On this point, continued the Baron, one heard much to\nhis credit; the Prince was said to be discreet and intelligent; but\nall such judgments were necessarily partial, and the Baron preferred to\nreserve his opinion until he could come to a trustworthy conclusion from\npersonal observation. And then he added: \"But all this is not enough.\nThe young man ought to have not merely great ability, but a right\nambition, and great force of will as well. To pursue for a lifetime a\npolitical career so arduous demands more than energy and inclination--it\ndemands also that earnest frame of mind which is ready of its own accord\nto sacrifice mere pleasure to real usefulness. If he is not satisfied\nhereafter with the consciousness of having achieved one of the most\ninfluential positions in Europe, how often will he feel tempted to\nrepent his adventure! If he does not from the very outset accept it as a\nvocation of grave responsibility, on the efficient performance of\nwhich his honour and happiness depend, there is small likelihood of his\nsucceeding.\"\nSuch were the views of Stockmar on the qualifications necessary for the\ndue fulfilment of that destiny which Albert's family had marked out for\nhim; and he hoped, during the tour in Italy, to come to some conclusion\nas to how far the prince possessed them. Albert on his side was much\nimpressed by the Baron, whom he had previously seen but rarely; he",

            "text": "He was not in love with her. Affection, gratitude, the natural reactions\nto the unqualified devotion of a lively young cousin who was also\na queen--such feelings possessed him, but the ardours of reciprocal\npassion were not his. Though he found that he liked Victoria very much,\nwhat immediately interested him in his curious position was less her\nthan himself. Dazzled and delighted, riding, dancing, singing, laughing,\namid the splendours of Windsor, he was aware of a new sensation--the\nstirrings of ambition in his breast. His place would indeed be a high,\nan enviable one! And then, on the instant, came another thought. The\nteaching of religion, the admonitions of Stockmar, his own inmost\nconvictions, all spoke with the same utterance. He would not be there to\nplease himself, but for a very different purpose--to do good. He must be\n\"noble, manly, and princely in all things,\" he would have \"to live and\nto sacrifice himself for the benefit of his new country;\" to \"use his\npowers and endeavours for a great object--that of promoting the welfare\nof multitudes of his fellowmen.\" One serious thought led on to another.\nThe wealth and the bustle of the English Court might be delightful for\nthe moment, but, after all, it was Coburg that had his heart. \"While\nI shall be untiring,\" he wrote to his grandmother, \"in my efforts and\nlabours for the country to which I shall in future belong, and where\nI am called to so high a position, I shall never cease ein treuer\nDeutscher, Coburger, Gothaner zu sein.\" And now he must part from Coburg\nfor ever! Sobered and sad, he sought relief in his brother Ernest's\ncompany; the two young men would shut themselves up together, and,\nsitting down at the pianoforte, would escape from the present and the\nfuture in the sweet familiar gaiety of a Haydn duet.\nThey returned to Germany; and while Albert, for a few farewell months,\nenjoyed, for the last time, the happiness of home, Victoria, for the\nlast time, resumed her old life in London and Windsor. She corresponded\ndaily with her future husband in a mingled flow of German and English;\nbut the accustomed routine reasserted itself; the business and the\npleasures of the day would brook no interruption; Lord M. was once\nmore constantly beside her; and the Tories were as intolerable as ever.\nIndeed, they were more so. For now, in these final moments, the old feud\nburst out with redoubled fury. The impetuous sovereign found, to her\nchagrin, that there might be disadvantages in being the declared enemy\nof one of the great parties in the State. On two occasions, the Tories\ndirectly thwarted her in a matter on which she had set her heart. She\nwished her husband's rank to be axed by statute, and their opposition\nprevented it. She wished her husband to receive a settlement from the\nnation of L50,000 a year; and, again owing to the Tories, he was only\nallowed L30,000. It was too bad. When the question was discussed in\nParliament, it had been pointed out that the bulk of the population was\nsuffering from great poverty, and that L30,000 was the whole revenue of\nCoburg; but her uncle Leopold had been given L50,000, and it would\nbe monstrous to give Albert less. Sir Robert Peel--it might have been\nexpected--had had the effrontery to speak and vote for the smaller sum.\nShe was very angry; and determined to revenge herself by omitting to\ninvite a single Tory to her wedding. She would make an exception in\nfavour of old Lord Liverpool, but even the Duke of Wellington she\nrefused to ask. When it was represented to her that it would amount to\na national scandal if the Duke were absent from her wedding, she was\nangrier than ever. \"What! That old rebel! I won't have him:\" she\nwas reported to have said. Eventually she was induced to send him an\ninvitation; but she made no attempt to conceal the bitterness of her\nfeelings, and the Duke himself was only too well aware of all that had",

It was time to go.

He\nwas whirled rapidly to his destiny. At Calais a steamboat awaited him,\nand, together with his father and his brother, he stepped, dejected, on\nboard. A little later, he was more dejected still.

To them--and\nparticularly to the high-born ladies and gentlemen who naturally saw him\nmost--what was immediately and distressingly striking in Albert's face\nand figure and whole demeanour was his un-English look. His features\nwere regular, no doubt, but there was something smooth and smug about\nthem; he was tall, but he was clumsily put together, and he walked with\na slight slouch.

            "text": "them. Owing partly to a natural awkwardness, partly to a fear of undue\nfamiliarity, and partly to a desire to be absolutely correct, his\nmanners were infused with an extraordinary stiffness and formality.\nWhenever he appeared in company, he seemed to be surrounded by a thick\nhedge of prickly etiquette. He never went out into ordinary society; he\nnever walked in the streets of London; he was invariably accompanied by\nan equerry when he rode or drove. He wanted to be irreproachable and, if\nthat involved friendlessness, it could not be helped. Besides, he had no\nvery high opinion of the English. So far as he could see, they cared for\nnothing but fox-hunting and Sunday observances; they oscillated between\nan undue frivolity and an undue gloom; if you spoke to them of friendly\njoyousness they stared; and they did not understand either the Laws of\nThought or the wit of a German University. Since it was clear that with\nsuch people he could have very little in common, there was no reason\nwhatever for relaxing in their favour the rules of etiquette. In strict\nprivacy, he could be natural and charming; Seymour and Anson were\ndevoted to him, and he returned their affection; but they were\nsubordinates--the receivers of his confidences and the agents of his\nwill. From the support and the solace of true companionship he was\nutterly cut off.\nA friend, indeed, he had--or rather, a mentor. The Baron, established\nonce more in the royal residence, was determined to work with as\nwholehearted a detachment for the Prince's benefit as, more than twenty\nyears before, he had worked for his uncle's. The situations then and\nnow, similar in many respects, were yet full of differences. Perhaps in\neither case the difficulties to be encountered were equally great; but\nthe present problem was the more complex and the more interesting. The\nyoung doctor who, unknown and insignificant, had nothing at the back of\nhim but his own wits and the friendship of an unimportant Prince, had\nbeen replaced by the accomplished confidant of kings and ministers, ripe\nin years, in reputation, and in the wisdom of a vast experience. It\nwas possible for him to treat Albert with something of the affectionate\nauthority of a father; but, on the other hand, Albert was no Leopold.\nAs the Baron was very well aware, he had none of his uncle's rigidity of\nambition, none of his overweening impulse to be personally great. He was\nvirtuous and well-intentioned; he was clever and well-informed; but he\ntook no interest in politics, and there were no signs that he possessed\nany commanding force of character. Left to himself, he would almost\ncertainly have subsided into a high-minded nonentity, an aimless\ndilettante busy over culture, a palace appendage without influence or\npower. But he was not left to himself: Stockmar saw to that. For ever\nat his pupil's elbow, the hidden Baron pushed him forward, with tireless\npressure, along the path which had been trod by Leopold so many years\nago. But, this time, the goal at the end of it was something more than\nthe mediocre royalty that Leopold had reached. The prize which Stockmar,\nwith all the energy of disinterested devotion, had determined should be\nAlbert's was a tremendous prize indeed.\nThe beginning of the undertaking proved to be the most arduous part\nof it. Albert was easily dispirited: what was the use of struggling to\nperform in a role which bored him and which, it was quite clear, nobody\nbut the dear good Baron had any desire that he should take up? It was\nsimpler, and it saved a great deal of trouble, to let things slide.\nBut Stockmar would not have it. Incessantly, he harped upon two\nstrings--Albert's sense of duty and his personal pride. Had the Prince\nforgotten the noble aims to which his life was to be devoted? And was he\ngoing to allow himself, his wife, his family, his whole existence, to be\ngoverned by Baroness Lehzen? The latter consideration was a potent one.\nAlbert had never been accustomed to giving way; and now, more than ever\nbefore, it would be humiliating to do so. Not only was he constantly\nexasperated by the position of the Baroness in the royal household;\nthere was another and a still more serious cause of complaint. He was,\nhe knew very well, his wife's intellectual superior, and yet he found,\nto his intense annoyance, that there were parts of her mind over which\nhe exercised no influence. When, urged on by the Baron, he attempted\nto discuss politics with Victoria, she eluded the subject, drifted into\ngeneralities, and then began to talk of something else. She was treating\nhim as she had once treated their uncle Leopold. When at last he\nprotested, she replied that her conduct was merely the result of\nindolence; that when she was with him she could not bear to bother her\nhead with anything so dull as politics. The excuse was worse than the\nfault: was he the wife and she the husband? It almost seemed so. But the\nBaron declared that the root of the mischief was Lehzen: that it was she\nwho encouraged the Queen to have secrets; who did worse--undermined",

            "text": "With the final emergence of the Prince came the final extinction of Lord\nMelbourne. A year after his loss of office, he had been struck down by\na paralytic seizure; he had apparently recovered, but his old elasticity\nhad gone for ever. Moody, restless, and unhappy, he wandered like a\nghost about the town, bursting into soliloquies in public places, or\nasking odd questions, suddenly, a propos de bottes. \"I'll be hanged if\nI do it for you, my Lord,\" he was heard to say in the hall at Brooks's,\nstanding by himself, and addressing the air after much thought. \"Don't\nyou consider,\" he abruptly asked a fellow-guest at Lady Holland's,\nleaning across the dinner-table in a pause of the conversation, \"that\nit was a most damnable act of Henri Quatre to change his religion with\na view to securing the Crown?\" He sat at home, brooding for hours in\nmiserable solitude. He turned over his books--his classics and his\nTestaments--but they brought him no comfort at all. He longed for the\nreturn of the past, for the impossible, for he knew not what, for the\ndevilries of Caro, for the happy platitudes of Windsor. His friends had\nleft him, and no wonder, he said in bitterness--the fire was out. He\nsecretly hoped for a return to power, scanning the newspapers with\nsolicitude, and occasionally making a speech in the House of Lords. His\ncorrespondence with the Queen continued, and he appeared from time to\ntime at Court; but he was a mere simulacrum of his former self; \"the\ndream,\" wrote Victoria, \"is past.\" As for his political views, they\ncould no longer be tolerated. The Prince was an ardent Free Trader, and\nso, of course, was the Queen; and when, dining at Windsor at the time of\nthe repeal of the Corn Laws, Lord Melbourne suddenly exclaimed, \"Ma'am,\nit's a damned dishonest act!\" everyone was extremely embarrassed. Her\nMajesty laughed and tried to change the conversation, but without avail;\nLord Melbourne returned to the charge again and again with--\"I say,\nMa'am, it's damned dishonest!\"--until the Queen said \"Lord Melbourne, I\nmust beg you not to say anything more on this subject now;\" and then\nhe held his tongue. She was kind to him, writing him long letters, and\nalways remembering his birthday; but it was kindness at a distance, and\nhe knew it. He had become \"poor Lord Melbourne.\" A profound disquietude\ndevoured him. He tried to fix his mind on the condition of Agriculture\nand the Oxford Movement. He wrote long memoranda in utterly\nundecipherable handwriting. He was convinced that he had lost all his\nmoney, and could not possibly afford to be a Knight of the Garter. He\nhad run through everything, and yet--if Peel went out, he might be sent\nfor--why not? He was never sent for. The Whigs ignored him in their\nconsultations, and the leadership of the party passed to Lord\nJohn Russell. When Lord John became Prime Minister, there was much\npoliteness, but Lord Melbourne was not asked to join the Cabinet. He\nbore the blow with perfect amenity; but he understood, at last, that\nthat was the end.\nFor two years more he lingered, sinking slowly into unconsciousness and\nimbecility. Sometimes, propped up in his chair, he would be heard to\nmurmur, with unexpected appositeness, the words of Samson:--\n\"So much I feel my general spirit droop,\nMy hopes all flat, nature within me seems,\nIn all her functions weary of herself,\nMy race of glory run, and race of shame,\nAnd I shall shortly be with them that rest.\"\nA few days before his death, Victoria, learning that there was no hope\nof his recovery, turned her mind for a little towards that which had\nonce been Lord M. \"You will grieve to hear,\" she told King Leopold,\n\"that our good, dear, old friend Melbourne is dying... One cannot\nforget how good and kind and amiable he was, and it brings back so many\nrecollections to my mind, though, God knows! I never wish that time back\nagain.\"\nShe was in little danger. The tide of circumstance was flowing now\nwith irresistible fullness towards a very different consummation.\nThe seriousness of Albert, the claims of her children, her own inmost\ninclinations, and the movement of the whole surrounding world, combined\nto urge her forward along the narrow way of public and domestic duty.",

Within eighteen months of the birth of\nthe Prince of Wales the Princess Alice appeared, and a year later the\nPrince Alfred, and then the Princess Helena, and, two years afterwards,\nthe Princess Louise; and still there were signs that the pretty row of\nroyal infants was not complete. The parents, more and more involved in\nfamily cares and family happiness, found the pomp of Windsor galling,\nand longed for some more intimate and remote retreat. On the advice of\nPeel they purchased the estate of Osborne, in the Isle of Wight. Their\nskill and economy in financial matters had enabled them to lay aside a\nsubstantial sum of money; and they could afford, out of their savings,\nnot merely to buy the property but to build a new house for themselves\nand to furnish it at a cost of L200,000. At Osborne, by the sea-shore,\nand among the woods, which Albert, with memories of Rosenau in his mind,\nhad so carefully planted, the royal family spent every hour that could\nbe snatched from Windsor and London--delightful hours of deep retirement\nand peaceful work. The public looked on with approval. A few aristocrats\nmight sniff or titter; but with the nation at large the Queen was now\nonce more extremely popular. The middle-classes, in particular, were\npleased. They liked a love-match; they liked a household which combined\nthe advantages of royalty and virtue, and in which they seemed to see,\nreflected as in some resplendent looking-glass, the ideal image of the\nvery lives they led themselves. Their own existences, less exalted,\nbut oh! so soothingly similar, acquired an added excellence, an added\nsucculence, from the early hours, the regularity, the plain tuckers, the\nround games, the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding oft Osborne. It was\nindeed a model Court. Not only were its central personages the patterns\nof propriety, but no breath of scandal, no shadow of indecorum, might\napproach its utmost boundaries. For Victoria, with all the zeal of a\nconvert, upheld now the standard of moral purity with an inflexibility\nsurpassing, if that were possible, Albert's own. She blushed to think\nhow she had once believed--how she had once actually told HIM--that one\nmight be too strict and particular in such matters, and that one ought\nto be indulgent towards other people's dreadful sins. But she was\nno longer Lord M's pupil: she was Albert's wife. She was more--the\nembodiment, the living apex of a new era in the generations of mankind.\nThe last vestige of the eighteenth century had disappeared; cynicism and\nsubtlety were shrivelled into powder; and duty, industry, morality, and\ndomesticity triumphed over them. Even the very chairs and tables had\nassumed, with a singular responsiveness, the forms of prim solidity. The\nVictorian Age was in full swing.",

            "text": "to supply this want. He mused, and was inspired: the Great Exhibition\ncame into his head.\nWithout consulting anyone, he thought out the details of his conception\nwith the minutest care. There had been exhibitions before in the world,\nbut this should surpass them all. It should contain specimens of\nwhat every country could produce in raw materials, in machinery and\nmechanical inventions, in manufactures, and in the applied and plastic\narts. It should not be merely useful and ornamental; it should teach\na high moral lesson. It should be an international monument to those\nsupreme blessings of civilisation--peace, progress, and prosperity. For\nsome time past the Prince had been devoting much of his attention to the\nproblems of commerce and industry. He had a taste for machinery of every\nkind, and his sharp eye had more than once detected, with the precision\nof an expert, a missing cog-wheel in some vast and complicated engine. A\nvisit to Liverpool, where he opened the Albert Dock, impressed upon his\nmind the immensity of modern industrial forces, though in a letter\nto Victoria describing his experiences, he was careful to retain his\ncustomary lightness of touch. \"As I write,\" he playfully remarked,\n\"you will be making your evening toilette, and not be ready in time for\ndinner. I must set about the same task, and not, let me hope, with the\nsame result... The loyalty and enthusiasm of the inhabitants are great;\nbut the heat is greater still. I am satisfied that if the population of\nLiverpool had been weighed this morning, and were to be weighed again\nnow, they would be found many degrees lighter. The docks are wonderful,\nand the mass of shipping incredible.\" In art and science he had been\ndeeply interested since boyhood; his reform of the household had put\nhis talent for organisation beyond a doubt; and thus from every point\nof view the Prince was well qualified for his task. Having matured his\nplans, he summoned a small committee and laid an outline of his scheme\nbefore it. The committee approved, and the great undertaking was set on\nfoot without delay.\nTwo years, however, passed before it was completed. For two years the\nPrince laboured with extraordinary and incessant energy. At first all\nwent smoothly. The leading manufacturers warmly took up the idea; the\ncolonies and the East India Company were sympathetic; the great foreign\nnations were eager to send in their contributions; the powerful support\nof Sir Robert Peel was obtained, and the use of a site in Hyde Park,\nselected by the Prince, was sanctioned by the Government. Out of 234\nplans for the exhibition building, the Prince chose that of Joseph\nPaxton, famous as a designer of gigantic conservatories; and the work\nwas on the point of being put in hand when a series of unexpected\ndifficulties arose. Opposition to the whole scheme, which had long been\nsmouldering in various quarters, suddenly burst forth. There was\nan outcry, headed by The Times, against the use of the park for the\nexhibition; for a moment it seemed as if the building would be relegated\nto a suburb; but, after a fierce debate in the House, the supporters\nof the site in the Park won the day. Then it appeared that the project\nlacked a sufficient financial backing; but this obstacle, too, was\nsurmounted, and eventually L200,000 was subscribed as a guarantee fund.\nThe enormous glass edifice rose higher and higher, covering acres and\nenclosing towering elm trees beneath its roof: and then the fury of\nits enemies reached a climax. The fashionable, the cautious, the\nProtectionists, the pious, all joined in the hue and cry. It was pointed\nout that the Exhibition would serve as a rallying point for all the\nruffians in England, for all the malcontents in Europe; and that on\nthe day of its opening there would certainly be a riot and probably a\nrevolution. It was asserted that the glass roof was porous, and that the\ndroppings of fifty million sparrows would utterly destroy every object\nbeneath it. Agitated nonconformists declared that the Exhibition was an\narrogant and wicked enterprise which would infallibly bring down God's\npunishment upon the nation. Colonel Sibthorpe, in the debate on the\nAddress, prayed that hail and lightning might descend from heaven on the\naccursed thing. The Prince, with unyielding perseverance and infinite\npatience, pressed on to his goal. His health was seriously affected; he\nsuffered from constant sleeplessness; his strength was almost worn out.\nBut he remembered the injunctions of Stockmar and never relaxed. The\nvolume of his labours grew more prodigious every day; he toiled at\ncommittees, presided over public meetings, made speeches, and carried on\ncommunications with every corner of the civilised world--and his efforts\nwere rewarded. On May 1, 1851, the Great Exhibition was opened by the\nQueen before an enormous concourse of persons, amid scenes of dazzling\nbrilliancy and triumphant enthusiasm.",

She performed her duties in a trance of joy, gratitude, and\namazement, and, when it was all over, her feelings poured themselves out\ninto her journal in a torrential flood. The day had been nothing but\nan endless succession of glories--or rather one vast glory--one vast\nradiation of Albert. Everything she had seen, everything she had felt\nor heard, had been so beautiful, so wonderful that even the royal\nunderlinings broke down under the burden of emphasis, while her\nremembering pen rushed on, regardless, from splendour to splendour--the\nhuge crowds, so well--behaved and loyal-flags of all the nations\nfloating--the inside of the building, so immense, with myriads of people\nand the sun shining through the roof--a little side room, where we left\nour shawls--palm-trees and machinery--dear Albert--the place so big\nthat we could hardly hear the organ--thankfulness to God--a curious\nassemblage of political and distinguished men--the March from\nAthalie--God bless my dearest Albert, God bless my dearest country!--a\nglass fountain--the Duke and Lord Anglesey walking arm in arm--a\nbeautiful Amazon, in bronze, by Kiss--Mr. Paxton, who might be justly\nproud, and rose from being a common gardener's boy--Sir George Grey in\ntears, and everybody astonished and delighted.\nA striking incident occurred when, after a short prayer by the\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the choir of 600 voices burst into the\n\"Hallelujah Chorus.\" At that moment a Chinaman, dressed in full national\ncostume, stepped out into the middle of the central nave, and, advancing\nslowly towards the royal group, did obeisance to Her Majesty. The Queen,\nmuch impressed, had no doubt that he was an eminent mandarin; and,\nwhen the final procession was formed, orders were given that, as\nno representative of the Celestial Empire was present, he should be\nincluded in the diplomatic cortege. He accordingly, with the utmost\ngravity, followed immediately behind the Ambassadors. He subsequently\ndisappeared, and it was rumoured, among ill-natured people, that, far\nfrom being a mandarin, the fellow was a mere impostor. But nobody ever\nreally discovered the nature of the comments that had been lurking\nbehind the matchless impassivity of that yellow face.\nA few days later Victoria poured out her heart to her uncle. The\nfirst of May, she said, was \"the GREATEST day in our history, the most\nBEAUTIFUL and IMPOSING and TOUCHING spectacle ever seen, and the triumph\nof my beloved Albert... It was the HAPPIEST, PROUDEST day in my life,\nand I can think of nothing else. Albert's dearest name is immortalised\nwith this GREAT conception, HIS own, and my OWN dear country SHOWED she\nwas WORTHY of it. The triumph is IMMENSE.\"\nIt was. The enthusiasm was universal; even the bitterest scoffers were\nconverted, and joined in the chorus of praise. Congratulations from\npublic bodies poured in; the City of Paris gave a great fete to the\nExhibition committee; and the Queen and the Prince made a triumphal\nprogress through the North of England. The financial results were\nequally remarkable. The total profit made by the Exhibition amounted to\na sum of L165,000, which was employed in the purchase of land for the\nerection of a permanent National Museum in South Kensington. During\nthe six months of its existence in Hyde Park over six million persons\nvisited it, and not a single accident occurred. But there is an end to\nall things; and the time had come for the Crystal Palace to be removed\nto the salubrious seclusion of Sydenham. Victoria, sad but resigned,\npaid her final visit. \"It looked so beautiful,\" she said. \"I could not\nbelieve it was the last time I was to see it. An organ, accompanied by\na fine and powerful wind instrument called the sommerophone, was being\nplayed, and it nearly upset me. The canvas is very dirty, the red\ncurtains are faded and many things are very much soiled, still the\neffect is fresh and new as ever and most beautiful. The glass fountain\nwas already removed... and the sappers and miners were rolling about\nthe little boxes just as they did at the beginning. It made us all very\nmelancholy.\" But more cheerful thoughts followed. When all was over,\nshe expressed her boundless satisfaction in a dithyrambic letter to\nthe Prime Minister. Her beloved husband's name, she said, was for ever\nimmortalised, and that this was universally recognised by the country\nwas a source to her of immense happiness and gratitude. \"She feels\ngrateful to Providence,\" Her Majesty concluded, \"to have permitted her\nto be united to so great, so noble, so excellent a Prince, and this year\nwill ever remain the proudest and happiest of her life. The day of the\nclosing of the Exhibition (which the Queen regretted much she could not\nwitness), was the twelfth anniversary of her betrothal to the Prince,\nwhich is a curious coincidence.\"",

            "text": "But Palmerston, busy with his plans, his ambitions, and the management\nof a great department, brushed all such considerations on one side; it\nwas his favourite method of action. He lived by instinct--by a quick eye\nand a strong hand, a dexterous management of every crisis as it arose, a\nhalf-unconscious sense of the vital elements in a situation. He was very\nbold; and nothing gave him more exhilaration than to steer the ship of\nstate in a high wind, on a rough sea, with every stitch of canvas on her\nthat she could carry. But there is a point beyond which boldness becomes\nrashness--a point perceptible only to intuition and not to reason;\nand beyond that point Palmerston never went. When he saw that the cast\ndemanded it, he could go slow--very slow indeed in fact, his whole\ncareer, so full of vigorous adventure, was nevertheless a masterly\nexample of the proverb, \"tout vient a point a qui sait attendre.\" But\nwhen he decided to go quick, nobody went quicker. One day, returning\nfrom Osborne, he found that he had missed the train to London; he\nordered a special, but the station master told him that to put a special\ntrain upon the line at that time of day would be dangerous and he\ncould not allow it. Palmerston insisted declaring that he had important\nbusiness in London, which could not wait. The station-master supported\nby all the officials, continued to demur the company, he said, could\nnot possibly take the responsibility. \"On MY responsibility, then!\" said\nPalmerston, in his off-hand, peremptory way whereupon the station-master\nordered up the train and the Foreign Secretary reached London in time\nfor his work, without an accident. The story, is typical of the happy\nvaliance with which he conducted both his own affairs and those of\nthe nation. \"England,\" he used to say, \"is strong enough to brave\nconsequences.\" Apparently, under Palmerston's guidance, she was. While\nthe officials protested and shook in their shoes, he would wave them\naway with his airy \"MY responsibility!\" and carry the country swiftly\nalong the line of his choice, to a triumphant destination--without an\naccident. His immense popularity was the result partly of his diplomatic\nsuccesses, partly of his extraordinary personal affability, but chiefly\nof the genuine intensity with which he responded to the feelings and\nsupported the interests of his countrymen. The public knew that it had\nin Lord Palmerston not only a high-mettled master, but also a devoted\nservant--that he was, in every sense of the word, a public man. When he\nwas Prime Minister, he noticed that iron hurdles had been put up on\nthe grass in the Green Park; he immediately wrote to the Minister\nresponsible, ordering, in the severest language, their instant removal,\ndeclaring that they were \"an intolerable nuisance,\" and that the purpose\nof the grass was \"to be walked upon freely and without restraint by the\npeople, old and young, for whose enjoyment the parks are maintained.\"\nIt was in this spirit that, as Foreign Secretary, he watched over the\ninterests of Englishmen abroad. Nothing could be more agreeable for\nEnglishmen; but foreign governments were less pleased. They found Lord\nPalmerston interfering, exasperating, and alarming. In Paris they spoke\nwith bated breath of \"ce terrible milord Palmerston;\" and in Germany\nthey made a little song about him--\n\"Hat der Teufel einen Sohn,\nSo ist er sicher Palmerston.\"\nBut their complaints, their threats, and their agitations were all\nin vain. Palmerston, with his upper lip sardonically curving, braved\nconsequences, and held on his course.",

            "text": "The first diplomatic crisis which arose after his return to office,\nthough the Prince and the Queen were closely concerned with it, passed\noff without serious disagreement between the Court and the Minister. For\nsome years past a curious problem had been perplexing the chanceries\nof Europe. Spain, ever since the time of Napoleon a prey to civil\nconvulsions, had settled down for a short interval to a state of\ncomparative quiet under the rule of Christina, the Queen Mother, and her\ndaughter Isabella, the young Queen. In 1846, the question of\nIsabella's marriage, which had for long been the subject of diplomatic\nspeculations, suddenly became acute. Various candidates for her hand\nwere proposed--among others, two cousins of her own, another Spanish\nprince, and Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, a first cousin of Victoria's\nand Albert's; for different reasons, however, none of these young men\nseemed altogether satisfactory. Isabella was not yet sixteen; and it\nmight have been supposed that her marriage could be put off for a few\nyears more; but this was considered to be out of the question. \"Vous\nne savez pas,\" said a high authority, \"ce que c'est que ces princesses\nespagnoles; elles ont le diable au corps, et on a toujours dit que si\nnous ne nous hations pas, l'heritier viendrait avant le mari.\" It might\nalso have been supposed that the young Queen's marriage was a matter to\nbe settled by herself, her mother, and the Spanish Government; but\nthis again was far from being the case. It had become, by one of those\nperiodical reversions to the ways of the eighteenth century, which,\nit is rumoured, are still not unknown in diplomacy, a question of\ndominating importance in the foreign policies both of France and\nEngland. For several years, Louis Philippe and his Prime Minister Guizot\nhad been privately maturing a very subtle plan. It was the object of the\nFrench King to repeat the glorious coup of Louis XIV, and to abolish\nthe Pyrenees by placing one of his grandsons on the throne of Spain.\nIn order to bring this about, he did not venture to suggest that his\nyounger son, the Duc de Montpensier, should marry Isabella; that would\nhave been too obvious a move, which would have raised immediate and\ninsurmountable opposition. He therefore proposed that Isabella\nshould marry her cousin, the Duke of Cadiz, while Montpensier married\nIsabella's younger sister, the Infanta Fernanda; and pray, what possible\nobjection could there be to that? The wily old King whispered into\nthe chaste ears of Guizot the key to the secret; he had good reason to\nbelieve that the Duke of Cadiz was incapable of having children, and\ntherefore the offspring of Fernanda would inherit the Spanish crown.\nGuizot rubbed his hands, and began at once to set the necessary springs\nin motion; but, of course, the whole scheme was very soon divulged and\nunderstood. The English Government took an extremely serious view of\nthe matter; the balance of power was clearly at stake, and the French\nintrigue must be frustrated at all hazards. A diplomatic struggle of\ngreat intensity followed; and it occasionally appeared that a second War\nof the Spanish Succession was about to break out. This was avoided,\nbut the consequences of this strange imbroglio were far-reaching and\ncompletely different from what any of the parties concerned could have",

The ruin which had fallen upon the\nHouse of Coburg during the Napoleonic wars had apparently only served\nto multiply its vitality, for that princely family had by now extended\nitself over Europe in an extraordinary manner. King Leopold was firmly\nfixed in Belgium; his niece was Queen of England; one of his nephews\nwas the husband of the Queen of England, and another the husband of the\nQueen of Portugal; yet another was Duke of Wurtemberg. Where was this\nto end? There seemed to be a Coburg Trust ready to send out one of\nits members at any moment to fill up any vacant place among the ruling\nfamilies of Europe. And even beyond Europe there were signs of this\ninfection spreading. An American who had arrived in Brussels had assured\nKing Leopold that there was a strong feeling in the United States in\nfavour of monarchy instead of the misrule of mobs, and had suggested, to\nthe delight of His Majesty, that some branch of the Coburg family might\nbe available for the position. That danger might, perhaps, be remote;\nbut the Spanish danger was close at hand; and if Prince Leopold were to\nmarry Queen Isabella the position of France would be one of humiliation,\nif not of positive danger. Such were the asseverations of Louis\nPhilippe. The English Government had no wish to support Prince Leopold,\nand though Albert and Victoria had some hankerings for the match, the\nwisdom of Stockmar had induced them to give up all thoughts of it.

In that year of\nrevolutions, when, in all directions and with alarming frequency, crowns\nkept rolling off royal heads, Albert and Victoria were appalled to find\nthat the policy of England was persistently directed--in Germany,\nin Switzerland, in Austria, in Italy, in Sicily--so as to favour the\ninsurgent forces. The situation, indeed, was just such a one as the soul\nof Palmerston loved. There was danger and excitement, the necessity\nof decision, the opportunity for action, on every hand. A disciple of\nCanning, with an English gentleman's contempt and dislike of foreign\npotentates deep in his heart, the spectacle of the popular uprisings,\nand of the oppressors bundled ignominiously out of the palaces they had\ndisgraced, gave him unbounded pleasure, and he was determined that there\nshould be no doubt whatever, all over the Continent, on which side in\nthe great struggle England stood. It was not that he had the slightest\ntincture in him of philosophical radicalism; he had no philosophical\ntinctures of any kind; he was quite content to be inconsistent--to be a\nConservative at home and a Liberal abroad. There were very good reasons\nfor keeping the Irish in their places; but what had that to do with it?\nThe point was this--when any decent man read an account of the political\nprisons in Naples his gorge rose. He did not want war; but he saw that\nwithout war a skilful and determined use of England's power might do\nmuch to further the cause of the Liberals in Europe. It was a difficult\nand a hazardous game to play, but he set about playing it with delighted\nalacrity. And then, to his intense annoyance, just as he needed all\nhis nerve and all possible freedom of action, he found himself being\nhampered and distracted at every turn by... those people at Osborne.\nHe saw what it was; the opposition was systematic and informed, and\nthe Queen alone would have been incapable of it; the Prince was at the\nbottom of the whole thing. It was exceedingly vexatious; but Palmerston\nwas in a hurry, and could not wait; the Prince, if he would insist upon\ninterfering, must be brushed on one side.\nAlbert was very angry. He highly disapproved both of Palmerston's policy\nand of his methods of action. He was opposed to absolutism; but in his\nopinion Palmerston's proceedings were simply calculated to substitute\nfor absolutism, all over Europe, something no better and very possibly\nworse--the anarchy of faction and mob violence. The dangers of\nthis revolutionary ferment were grave; even in England Chartism was\nrampant--a sinister movement, which might at any moment upset the",

            "text": "constitutional significance, was entirely unknown to the outside world.\nIf Palmerston had been a sensitive man, he would probably have resigned\non the receipt of the Queen's missive. But he was far from sensitive; he\nloved power, and his power was greater than ever; an unerring instinct\ntold him that this was not the time to go. Nevertheless, he was\nseriously perturbed. He understood at last that he was struggling with\na formidable adversary, whose skill and strength, unless they were\nmollified, might do irreparable injury to his career. He therefore wrote\nto Lord John, briefly acquiescing in the Queen's requirements--\"I have\ntaken a copy of this memorandum of the Queen and will not fail to attend\nto the directions which it contains\"--and at the same time, he asked for\nan interview with the Prince. Albert at once summoned him to the Palace,\nand was astonished to observe, as he noted in a memorandum, that when\nPalmerston entered the room \"he was very much agitated, shook, and\nhad tears in his eyes, so as quite to move me, who never under any\ncircumstances had known him otherwise than with a bland smile on his\nface.\" The old statesman was profuse in protestations and excuses; the\nyoung one was coldly polite. At last, after a long and inconclusive\nconversation, the Prince, drawing himself up, said that, in order to\ngive Lord Palmerston \"an example of what the Queen wanted,\" he would\n\"ask him a question point-blank.\" Lord Palmerston waited in respectful\nsilence, while the Prince proceeded as follows: \"You are aware that the\nQueen has objected to the Protocol about Schleswig, and of the grounds\non which she has done so. Her opinion has been overruled, the Protocol\nstating the desire of the Great Powers to see the integrity of the\nDanish monarchy preserved has been signed, and upon this the King of\nDenmark has invaded Schleswig, where the war is raging. If Holstein is\nattacked also, which is likely, the Germans will not be restrained from\nflying to her assistance; Russia has menaced to interfere with arms,\nif the Schleswigers are successful. What will you do, if this emergency\narises (provoking most likely an European war), and which will arise\nvery probably when we shall be at Balmoral and Lord John in another\npart of Scotland? The Queen expects from your foresight that you have\ncontemplated this possibility, and requires a categorical answer as\nto what you would do in the event supposed.\" Strangely enough, to this\npointblank question, the Foreign Secretary appeared to be unable to\nreply. The whole matter, he said, was extremely complicated, and the\ncontingencies mentioned by His Royal Highness were very unlikely to\narise. The Prince persisted; but it was useless; for a full hour he\nstruggled to extract a categorical answer, until at length Palmerston\nbowed himself out of the room. Albert threw up his hands in shocked\namazement: what could one do with such a man?\nWhat indeed? For, in spite of all his apologies and all his promises,\nwithin a few weeks the incorrigible reprobate was at his tricks again.\nThe Austrian General Haynau, notorious as a rigorous suppressor of\nrebellion in Hungary and Italy, and in particular as a flogger of women,\ncame to England and took it into his head to pay a visit to Messrs.\nBarclay and Perkins's brewery. The features of \"General Hyena,\" as he\nwas everywhere called--his grim thin face, his enormous pepper-and-salt\nmoustaches--had gained a horrid celebrity; and it so happened that among\nthe clerks at the brewery there was a refugee from Vienna, who had\ngiven his fellow-workers a first-hand account of the General's\ncharacteristics. The Austrian Ambassador, scenting danger, begged his\nfriend not to appear in public, or, if he must do so, to cut off his\nmoustaches first. But the General would take no advice. He went to the\nbrewery, was immediately recognised, surrounded by a crowd of angry\ndraymen, pushed about, shouted at, punched in the ribs, and pulled by\nthe moustaches until, bolting down an alley with the mob at his heels\nbrandishing brooms and roaring \"Hyena!\" he managed to take refuge in\na public house, whence he was removed under the protection of several\npolicemen. The Austrian Government was angry and demanded explanations.\nPalmerston, who, of course, was privately delighted by the incident,\nreplied regretting what had occurred, but adding that in his opinion\nthe General had \"evinced a want of propriety in coming to England at\nthe present moment;\" and he delivered his note to the Ambassador without\nhaving previously submitted it to the Queen or to the Prime Minister.\nNaturally, when this was discovered, there was a serious storm. The\nPrince was especially indignant; the conduct of the draymen he regarded,\nwith disgust and alarm, as \"a slight foretaste of what an unregulated\nmass of illiterate people is capable;\" and Palmerston was requested by\nLord John to withdraw his note, and to substitute for it another from\nwhich all censure of the General had been omitted. On this the Foreign\nSecretary threatened resignation, but the Prime Minister was firm. For a\nmoment the royal hopes rose high, only to be dashed to the ground again\nby the cruel compliance of the enemy. Palmerston, suddenly lamblike,\nagreed to everything; the note was withdrawn and altered, and peace was\npatched up once more.\nIt lasted for a year, and then, in October, 1851, the arrival of Kossuth\nin England brought on another crisis. Palmerston's desire to receive the\nHungarian patriot at his house in London was vetoed by Lord John; once\nmore there was a sharp struggle; once more Palmerston, after threatening\nresignation, yielded. But still the insubordinate man could not keep\nquiet. A few weeks later a deputation of Radicals from Finsbury and\nIslington waited on him at the Foreign Office and presented him with an\naddress, in which the Emperors of Austria and Russia were stigmatised as\n\"odious and detestable assassins\" and \"merciless tyrants and despots.\"\nThe Foreign Secretary in his reply, while mildly deprecating these\nexpressions, allowed his real sentiments to appear with a most\nundiplomatic insouciance There was an immediate scandal, and the Court\nflowed over with rage and vituperation. \"I think,\" said the Baron, \"the\nman has been for some time insane.\" Victoria, in an agitated letter,\nurged Lord John to assert his authority. But Lord John perceived that on\nthis matter the Foreign Secretary had the support of public opinion, and\nhe judged it wiser to bide his time.\nHe had not long to wait. The culmination of the long series of\nconflicts, threats, and exacerbations came before the year was out. On\nDecember 2, Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat took place in Paris; and on\nthe following day Palmerston, without consulting anybody, expressed in a\nconversation with the French Ambassador his approval of Napoleon's act.\nTwo days later, he was instructed by the Prime Minister, in accordance\nwith a letter from the Queen, that it was the policy of the English\nGovernment to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality towards the\naffairs of France. Nevertheless, in an official despatch to the British\nAmbassador in Paris, he repeated the approval of the coup d'etat which\nhe had already given verbally to the French Ambassador in London. This\ndespatch was submitted neither to the Queen nor to the Prime Minister.\nLord John's patience, as he himself said, \"was drained to the last\ndrop.\" He dismissed Lord Palmerston.\nVictoria was in ecstasies; and Albert knew that the triumph was his even\nmore than Lord John's. It was his wish that Lord Granville, a young man\nwhom he believed to be pliant to his influence, should be Palmerston's",

His\npresence gave a new prominence to an old problem--the precise definition\nof the functions and the powers of the Crown. Those functions and powers\nhad become, in effect, his; and what sort of use was he making of them?\nHis views as to the place of the Crown in the Constitution are easily\nascertainable; for they were Stockmar's; and it happens that we possess\na detailed account of Stockmar's opinions upon the subject in a long\nletter addressed by him to the Prince at the time of this very crisis,\njust before the outbreak of the Crimean War. Constitutional Monarchy,\naccording to the Baron, had suffered an eclipse since the passing of\nthe Reform Bill. It was now \"constantly in danger of becoming a pure\nMinisterial Government.\" The old race of Tories, who \"had a direct\ninterest in upholding the prerogatives of the Crown,\" had died out;\nand the Whigs were \"nothing but partly conscious, partly unconscious\nRepublicans, who stand in the same relation to the Throne as the wolf\ndoes to the lamb.\" There was a rule that it was unconstitutional to\nintroduce \"the name and person of the irresponsible Sovereign\"\ninto parliamentary debates on constitutional matters; this was \"a\nconstitutional fiction, which, although undoubtedly of old standing,\nwas fraught with danger\"; and the Baron warned the Prince that \"if the\nEnglish Crown permit a Whig Ministry to follow this rule in practice,\nwithout exception, you must not wonder if in a little time you find the\nmajority of the people impressed with the belief that the King, in the\nview of the law, is nothing but a mandarin figure, which has to nod\nits head in assent, or shake it in denial, as his Minister pleases.\"\nTo prevent this from happening, it was of extreme importance, said\nthe Baron, \"that no opportunity should be let slip of vindicating the\nlegitimate position of the Crown.\" \"And this is not hard to do,\" he\nadded, \"and can never embarrass a Minister where such straightforward\nloyal personages as the Queen and the Prince are concerned.\" In his\nopinion, the very lowest claim of the Royal Prerogative should include\n\"a right on the part of the King to be the permanent President of his\nMinisterial Council.\" The Sovereign ought to be \"in the position of\na permanent Premier, who takes rank above the temporary head of the\nCabinet, and in matters of discipline exercises supreme authority.\" The\nSovereign \"may even take a part in the initiation and the maturing of\nthe Government measures; for it would be unreasonable to expect that a\nking, himself as able, as accomplished, and as patriotic as the best of\nhis Ministers, should be prevented from making use of these qualities\nat the deliberations of his Council.\" \"The judicious exercise of this\nright,\" concluded the Baron, \"which certainly requires a master mind,\nwould not only be the best guarantee for Constitutional Monarchy, but\nwould raise it to a height of power, stability, and symmetry, which has\nnever been attained.\"\nNow it may be that this reading of the Constitution is a possible one,\nthough indeed it is hard to see how it can be made compatible with the\nfundamental doctrine of ministerial responsibility. William III presided\nover his Council, and he was a constitutional monarch; and it seems\nthat Stockmar had in his mind a conception of the Crown which would have\ngiven it a place in the Constitution analogous to that which it filled\nat the time of William III. But it is clear that such a theory, which\nwould invest the Crown with more power than it possessed even under\nGeorge III, runs counter to the whole development of English public life\nsince the Revolution; and the fact that it was held by Stockmar, and\ninstilled by him into Albert, was of very serious importance. For there\nwas good reason to believe not only that these doctrines were held by\nAlbert in theory, but that he was making a deliberate and sustained\nattempt to give them practical validity. The history of the struggle\nbetween the Crown and Palmerston provided startling evidence that this\nwas the case. That struggle reached its culmination when, in Stockmar's\nmemorandum of 1850, the Queen asserted her \"constitutional right\"\nto dismiss the Foreign Secretary if he altered a despatch which had\nreceived her sanction. The memorandum was, in fact, a plain declaration\nthat the Crown intended to act independently of the Prime Minister.\nLord John Russell, anxious at all costs to strengthen himself against\nPalmerston, accepted the memorandum, and thereby implicitly allowed the\nclaim of the Crown. More than that; after the dismissal of Palmerston,\namong the grounds on which Lord John justified that dismissal in the\nHouse of Commons he gave a prominent place to the memorandum of 1850. It\nbecame apparent that the displeasure of the Sovereign might be a reason\nfor the removal of a powerful and popular Minister. It seemed indeed",

In the winter, before the dawn, he was to be\nseen, seated at his writing-table, working by the light of the green\nreading--lamp which he had brought over with him from Germany, and\nthe construction of which he had much improved by an ingenious device.\nVictoria was early too, but she was not so early as Albert; and when, in\nthe chill darkness, she took her seat at her own writing-table, placed\nside by side with his, she invariably found upon it a neat pile of\npapers arranged for her inspection and her signature. The day,\nthus begun, continued in unremitting industry. At breakfast, the\nnewspapers--the once hated newspapers--made their appearance, and the\nPrince, absorbed in their perusal, would answer no questions, or, if\nan article struck him, would read it aloud. After, that there were\nministers and secretaries to interview; there was a vast correspondence\nto be carried on; there were numerous memoranda to be made. Victoria,\ntreasuring every word, preserving every letter, was all breathless\nattention and eager obedience. Sometimes Albert would actually ask her\nadvice. He consulted her about his English: \"Lese recht aufmerksam, und\nsage wenn irgend ein Fehler ist,\"(*) he would say; or, as he handed\nher a draft for her signature, he would observe, \"Ich hab' Dir hier ein\nDraft gemacht, lese es mal!

For whenever duty\ncalled, the Prince was all alertness. With indefatigable perseverance he\nopened museums, laid the foundation stones of hospitals, made speeches\nto the Royal Agricultural Society, and attended meetings of the British\nAssociation. The National Gallery particularly interested him: he drew\nup careful regulations for the arrangement of the pictures according to\nschools; and he attempted--though in vain--to have the whole collection\ntransported to South Kensington. Feodora, now the Princess Hohenlohe,\nafter a visit to England, expressed in a letter to Victoria her\nadmiration of Albert both as a private and a public character. Nor did\nshe rely only on her own opinion. \"I must just copy out,\" she said,\n\"what Mr. Klumpp wrote to me some little time ago, and which is\nquite true--'Prince Albert is one of the few Royal personages who can\nsacrifice to any principle (as soon as it has become evident to them to\nbe good and noble) all those notions (or sentiments) to which others,\nowing to their narrow-mindedness, or to the prejudices of their rank,\nare so thoroughly inclined strongly to cling.' There is something so\ntruly religious in this,\" the Princess added, \"as well as humane and\njust, most soothing to my feelings which are so often hurt and disturbed\nby what I hear and see.\"\nVictoria, from the depth of her heart, subscribed to all the eulogies of\nFeodora and Mr. Klumpp. She only found that they were insufficient. As\nshe watched her beloved Albert, after toiling with state documents and\npublic functions, devoting every spare moment of his time to domestic\nduties, to artistic appreciation, and to intellectual improvements; as\nshe listened to him cracking his jokes at the luncheon table, or playing\nMendelssohn on the organ, or pointing out the merits of Sir Edwin\nLandseer's pictures; as she followed him round while he gave\ninstructions about the breeding of cattle, or decided that the\nGainsboroughs must be hung higher up so that the Winterhalters might be\nproperly seen--she felt perfectly certain that no other wife had ever\nhad such a husband. His mind was apparently capable of everything,\nand she was hardly surprised to learn that he had made an important\ndiscovery for the conversion of sewage into agricultural manure.\nFiltration from below upwards, he explained, through some appropriate\nmedium, which retained the solids and set free the fluid sewage for\nirrigation, was the principle of the scheme. \"All previous plans,\"\nhe said, \"would have cost millions; mine costs next to nothing.\"\nUnfortunately, owing to a slight miscalculation, the invention proved\nto be impracticable; but Albert's intelligence was unrebuffed, and he\npassed on, to plunge with all his accustomed ardour into a prolonged\nstudy of the rudiments of lithography.",

            "text": "But naturally it was upon his children that his private interests and\nthose of Victoria were concentrated most vigorously. The royal nurseries\nshowed no sign of emptying. The birth of the Prince Arthur in 1850 was\nfollowed, three years later, by that of the Prince Leopold; and in\n1857 the Princess Beatrice was born. A family of nine must be, in any\ncircumstances, a grave responsibility; and the Prince realised to the\nfull how much the high destinies of his offspring intensified the need\nof parental care. It was inevitable that he should believe profoundly\nin the importance of education; he himself had been the product of\neducation; Stockmar had made him what he was; it was for him, in his\nturn, to be a Stockmar--to be even more than a Stockmar--to the young\ncreatures he had brought into the world. Victoria would assist him; a\nStockmar, no doubt, she could hardly be; but she could be perpetually\nvigilant, she could mingle strictness with her affection, and she could\nalways set a good example. These considerations, of course, applied\npre-eminently to the education of the Prince of Wales. How tremendous\nwas the significance of every particle of influence which went to the\nmaking of the future King of England! Albert set to work with a will.\nBut, watching with Victoria the minutest details of the physical,\nintellectual, and moral training of his children, he soon perceived, to\nhis distress, that there was something unsatisfactory in the development\nof his eldest son. The Princess Royal was an extremely intelligent\nchild; but Bertie, though he was good-humoured and gentle, seemed to\ndisplay a deep-seated repugnance to every form of mental exertion. This\nwas most regrettable, but the remedy was obvious: the parental efforts\nmust be redoubled; instruction must be multiplied; not for a single\ninstant must the educational pressure be allowed to relax. Accordingly,\nmore tutors were selected, the curriculum was revised, the time-table of\nstudies was rearranged, elaborate memoranda dealing with every possible\ncontingency were drawn up. It was above all essential that there should\nbe no slackness: \"Work,\" said the Prince, \"must be work.\" And work\nindeed it was. The boy grew up amid a ceaseless round of paradigms,\nsyntactical exercises, dates, genealogical tables, and lists of capes.\nConstant notes flew backwards and forwards between the Prince, the\nQueen, and the tutors, with inquiries, with reports of progress, with\ndetailed recommendations; and these notes were all carefully preserved\nfor future reference. It was, besides, vital that the heir to the throne\nshould be protected from the slightest possibility of contamination from\nthe outside world. The Prince of Wales was not as other boys; he might,\noccasionally, be allowed to invite some sons of the nobility, boys of\ngood character, to play with him in the garden of Buckingham Palace;\nbut his father presided, with alarming precision, over their sports. In\nshort, every possible precaution was taken, every conceivable effort\nwas made. Yet, strange to say, the object of all this vigilance and\nsolicitude continued to be unsatisfactory--appeared, in fact, to be\npositively growing worse. It was certainly very odd: the more lessons\nthat Bertie had to do, the less he did them; and the more carefully he\nwas guarded against excitements and frivolities, the more desirous\nof mere amusement he seemed to become. Albert was deeply grieved and\nVictoria was sometimes very angry; but grief and anger produced no more\neffect than supervision and time-tables. The Prince of Wales, in\nspite of everything, grew up into manhood without the faintest sign of\n\"adherence to and perseverance in the plan both of studies and life--\"\nas one of the Royal memoranda put it--which had been laid down with such\nextraordinary forethought by his father.",

After all, the Solent was a feeble\nbarrier. Oh, for some distant, some almost inaccessible sanctuary,\nwhere, in true domestic privacy, one could make happy holiday, just as\nif--or at least very, very, nearly--one were anybody else! Victoria,\never since, together with Albert, she had visited Scotland in the early\nyears of her marriage, had felt that her heart was in the Highlands. She\nhad returned to them a few years later, and her passion had grown. How\nromantic they were! And how Albert enjoyed them too! His spirits rose\nquite wonderfully as soon as he found himself among the hills and the\nconifers. \"It is a happiness to see him,\" she wrote. \"Oh! What can equal\nthe beauties of nature!\" she exclaimed in her journal, during one of\nthese visits. \"What enjoyment there is in them! Albert enjoys it so\nmuch; he is in ecstasies here.\" \"Albert said,\" she noted next day, \"that\nthe chief beauty of mountain scenery consists in its frequent changes.\nWe came home at six o'clock.\" Then she went on a longer expedition--up\nto the very top of a high hill. \"It was quite romantic. Here we were\nwith only this Highlander behind us holding the ponies (for we got off\ntwice and walked about). . . . We came home at half-past eleven,--the\nmost delightful, most romantic ride and walk I ever had. I had never\nbeen up such a mountain, and then the day was so fine.\" The Highlanders,\ntoo, were such astonishing people. They \"never make difficulties,\" she\nnoted, \"but are cheerful, and happy, and merry, and ready to walk,\nand run, and do anything.\" As for Albert he \"highly appreciated the\ngood-breeding, simplicity, and intelligence, which make it so pleasant\nand even instructive to talk to them.\" \"We were always in the habit,\"\nwrote Her Majesty, \"of conversing with the Highlanders--with whom one\ncomes so much in contact in the Highlands.\" She loved everything about\nthem--their customs, their dress, their dances, even their musical\ninstruments. \"There were nine pipers at the castle,\" she wrote after\nstaying with Lord Breadalbane; \"sometimes one and sometimes three\nplayed. They always played about breakfast-time, again during the\nmorning, at luncheon, and also whenever we went in and out; again before\ndinner, and during most of dinner-time.

In after years,\nwhen she looked back upon them, a kind of glory, a radiance as of\nan unearthly holiness, seemed to glow about these golden hours. Each\nhallowed moment stood out clear, beautiful, eternally significant. For,\nat the time, every experience there, sentimental, or grave, or trivial,\nhad come upon her with a peculiar vividness, like a flashing of\nmarvellous lights. Albert's stalkings--an evening walk when she lost her\nway--Vicky sitting down on a wasps' nest--a torchlight dance--with what\nintensity such things, and ten thousand like them, impressed themselves\nupon her eager consciousness! And how she flew to her journal to note\nthem down! The news of the Duke's death! What a moment--when, as she\nsat sketching after a picnic by a loch in the lonely hills, Lord Derby's\nletter had been brought to her, and she had learnt that \"ENGLAND'S, or\nrather BRITAIN'S pride, her glory, her hero, the greatest man she had\never produced, was no morel.\" For such were here reflections upon\nthe \"old rebel\" of former days. But that past had been utterly\nobliterated--no faintest memory of it remained. For years she had\nlooked up to the Duke as a figure almost superhuman. Had he not been a\nsupporter of good Sir Robert? Had he not asked Albert to succeed him as\ncommander-in-chief? And what a proud moment it had been when he stood as\nsponsor to her son Arthur, who was born on his eighty-first birthday! So\nnow she filled a whole page of her diary with panegyrical regrets. \"His\nposition was the highest a subject ever had--above party--looked up to\nby all--revered by the whole nation--the friend of the Sovereign... The\nCrown never possessed--and I fear never WILL--so DEVOTED, loyal,\nand faithful a subject, so staunch a supporter! To US his loss is\nIRREPARABLE... To Albert he showed the greatest kindness and the utmost\nconfidence... Not an eye will be dry in the whole country.\" These were\nserious thoughts; but they were soon succeeded by others hardly less\nmoving--by events as impossible to forget--by Mr. MacLeod's sermon\non Nicodemus--by the gift of a red flannel petticoat to Mrs. P.\nFarquharson, and another to old Kitty Kear.\nBut, without doubt, most memorable, most delightful of all were the\nexpeditions--the rare, exciting expeditions up distant mountains, across\nbroad rivers, through strange country, and lasting several days. With\nonly two gillies--Grant and Brown--for servants, and with assumed names.\nIt was more like something in a story than real life. \"We had decided\nto call ourselves LORD AND LADY CHURCHILL AND AND PARTY--Lady Churchill\npassing as MISS SPENCER and General Grey as DR. GREY! Brown once forgot\nthis and called me 'Your Majesty' as I was getting into the carriage,\nand Grant on the box once called Albert 'Your Royal Highness,' which\nset us off laughing, but no one observed it.\" Strong, vigorous,\nenthusiastic, bringing, so it seemed, good fortune with her--the\nHighlanders declared she had \"a lucky foot\"--she relished\neverything--the scrambles and the views and the contretemps and the\nrough inns with their coarse fare and Brown and Grant waiting at table.\nShe could have gone on for ever and ever, absolutely happy with Albert",

With that spontaneity of feeling which was so\npeculiarly her own, Victoria poured out her emotion, her admiration,\nher pity, her love, upon her \"dear soldiers.\" When she gave them their\nmedals her exultation knew no bounds. \"Noble fellows!\" she wrote to the\nKing of the Belgians, \"I own I feel as if these were MY OWN CHILDREN;\nmy heart beats for THEM as for my NEAREST and DEAREST. They were so\ntouched, so pleased; many, I hear, cried--and they won't hear of giving\nup their medals to have their names engraved upon them for fear they\nshould not receive the IDENTICAL ONE put into THEIR HANDS BY ME, which\nis quite touching. Several came by in a sadly mutilated state.\" She and\nthey were at one. They felt that she had done them a splendid honour,\nand she, with perfect genuineness, shared their feeling. Albert's\nattitude towards such things was different; there was an austerity\nin him which quite prohibited the expansions of emotion. When General\nWilliams returned from the heroic defence of Kars and was presented at\nCourt, the quick, stiff, distant bow with which the Prince received him\nstruck like ice upon the beholders. He was a stranger still.\nBut he had other things to occupy him, more important, surely, than the\npersonal impressions of military officers and people who went to Court.\nHe was at work--ceaselessly at work--on the tremendous task of carrying\nthrough the war to a successful conclusion. State papers, despatches,\nmemoranda, poured from him in an overwhelming stream. Between 1853 and\n1857 fifty folio volumes were filled with the comments of his pen upon\nthe Eastern question. Nothing would induce him to stop. Weary ministers\nstaggered under the load of his advice; but his advice continued, piling\nitself up over their writing-tables, and flowing out upon them from\nred box after red box. Nor was it advice to be ignored. The talent for\nadministration which had reorganised the royal palaces and planned the\nGreat Exhibition asserted itself no less in the confused complexities of\nwar. Again and again the Prince's suggestions, rejected or unheeded at\nfirst, were adopted under the stress of circumstances and found to be\nfull of value. The enrolment of a foreign legion, the establishment of\na depot for troops at Malta, the institution of periodical reports and\ntabulated returns as to the condition of the army at Sebastopol--such\nwere the contrivances and the achievements of his indefatigable brain.",

            "text": "Meanwhile Victoria had made a new friend: she had suddenly been\ncaptivated by Napoleon III. Her dislike of him had been strong at first.\nShe considered that he was a disreputable adventurer who had usurped the\nthrone of poor old Louis Philippe; and besides he was hand-in-glove\nwith Lord Palmerston. For a long time, although he was her ally, she was\nunwilling to meet him; but at last a visit of the Emperor and Empress to\nEngland was arranged. Directly he appeared at Windsor her heart began\nto soften. She found that she was charmed by his quiet manners, his\nlow, soft voice, and by the soothing simplicity of his conversation. The\ngood-will of England was essential to the Emperor's position in Europe,\nand he had determined to fascinate the Queen. He succeeded. There was\nsomething deep within her which responded immediately and vehemently to\nnatures that offered a romantic contrast with her own. Her adoration\nof Lord Melbourne was intimately interwoven with her half-unconscious\nappreciation of the exciting unlikeness between herself and that\nsophisticated, subtle, aristocratical old man. Very different was the\nquality of her unlikeness to Napoleon; but its quantity was at least\nas great. From behind the vast solidity of her respectability, her\nconventionality, her established happiness, she peered out with a\nstrange delicious pleasure at that unfamiliar, darkly-glittering foreign\nobject, moving so meteorically before her, an ambiguous creature of\nwilfulness and Destiny. And, to her surprise, where she had dreaded\nantagonisms, she discovered only sympathies. He was, she said, \"so\nquiet, so simple, naif even, so pleased to be informed about things he\ndoes not know, so gentle, so full of tact, dignity, and modesty, so full\nof kind attention towards us, never saying a word, or doing a thing,\nwhich could put me out... There is something fascinating, melancholy,\nand engaging which draws you to him, in spite of any prevention you may\nhave against him, and certainly without the assistance of any outward\nappearance, though I like his face.\" She observed that he rode\n\"extremely well, and looks well on horseback, as he sits high.\" And\nhe danced \"with great dignity and spirit.\" Above all, he listened to\nAlbert; listened with the most respectful attention; showed, in fact,\nhow pleased he was \"to be informed about things he did not know;\" and\nafterwards was heard to declare that he had never met the Prince's\nequal. On one occasion, indeed--but only on one--he had seemed to grow\nslightly restive. In a diplomatic conversation, \"I expatiated a little\non the Holstein question,\" wrote the Prince in a memorandum, \"which\nappeared to bore the Emperor as 'tres compliquee.'\"\nVictoria, too, became much attached to the Empress, whose looks and\ngraces she admired without a touch of jealousy. Eugenie, indeed, in\nthe plenitude of her beauty, exquisitely dressed in wonderful Parisian\ncrinolines which set off to perfection her tall and willowy figure,\nmight well have caused some heart-burning in the breast of her hostess,\nwho, very short, rather stout, quite plain, in garish middle-class\ngarments, could hardly be expected to feel at her best in such company.\nBut Victoria had no misgivings. To her it mattered nothing that her\nface turned red in the heat and that her purple pork-pie hat was of last\nyear's fashion, while Eugenie, cool and modish, floated in an infinitude\nof flounces by her side. She was Queen of England, and was not that\nenough? It certainly seemed to be; true majesty was hers, and she knew\nit. More than once, when the two were together in public, it was the\nwoman to whom, as it seemed, nature and art had given so little, who,\nby the sheer force of an inherent grandeur, completely threw her adorned\nand beautiful companion into the shade.",

Accordingly, when the Princess was\nnot yet fifteen, the Prince, a young man of twenty-four, came over on\na visit to Balmoral, and the betrothal took place. Two years later,\nin 1857, the marriage was celebrated. At the last moment, however, it\nseemed that there might be a hitch. It was pointed out in Prussia that\nit was customary for Princes of the blood royal to be married in Berlin,\nand it was suggested that there was no reason why the present case\nshould be treated as an exception. When this reached the ears of\nVictoria, she was speechless with indignation. In a note, emphatic\neven for Her Majesty, she instructed the Foreign Secretary to tell\nthe Prussian Ambassador \"not to ENTERTAIN the POSSIBILITY of such a\nquestion... The Queen NEVER could consent to it, both for public and for\nprivate reasons, and the assumption of its being TOO MUCH for a Prince\nRoyal of Prussia to come over to marry the Princess Royal of Great\nBritain in England is too ABSURD to say the least. . . Whatever may be\nthe usual practice of Prussian princes, it is not EVERY day that one\nmarries the eldest daughter of the Queen of England. The question must\ntherefore be considered as settled and closed.\" It was, and the\nwedding took place in St. James's Chapel. There were great\nfestivities--illuminations, state concerts, immense crowds, and general\nrejoicings. At Windsor a magnificent banquet was given to the bride and\nbridegroom in the Waterloo room, at which, Victoria noted in her diary,\n\"everybody was most friendly and kind about Vicky and full of the\nuniversal enthusiasm, of which the Duke of Buccleuch gave us most\npleasing instances, he having been in the very thick of the crowd and\namong the lowest of the low.\" Her feelings during several days had been\ngrowing more and more emotional, and when the time came for the young\ncouple to depart she very nearly broke down--but not quite. \"Poor dear\nchild!\" she wrote afterwards. \"I clasped her in my arms and blessed her,\nand knew not what to say. I kissed good Fritz and pressed his hand again\nand again. He was unable to speak and the tears were in his eyes. I\nembraced them both again at the carriage door, and Albert got into the\ncarriage, an open one, with them and Bertie... The band struck up. I\nwished good-bye to the good Perponchers. General Schreckenstein was much\naffected. I pressed his hand, and the good Dean's, and then went quickly",

A new sphere of life\nwill open for you in which you will have to be taught what to do and\nwhat not to do, a subject requiring study more important than any in\nwhich you have hitherto been engaged.\" On receipt of the memorandum\nBertie burst into tears. At the same time another memorandum was drawn\nup, headed \"confidential: for the guidance of the gentlemen appointed\nto attend on the Prince of Wales.\" This long and elaborate document laid\ndown \"certain principles\" by which the \"conduct and demeanour\" of the\ngentlemen were to be regulated \"and which it is thought may conduce to\nthe benefit of the Prince of Wales.\" \"The qualities which distinguish a\ngentleman in society,\" continued this remarkable paper, \"are:--\n(1) His appearance, his deportment and dress.\n(2) The character of his relations with, and treatment of, others.\n(3) His desire and power to acquit himself creditably in conversation or\nwhatever is the occupation of the society with which he mixes.\"\nA minute and detailed analysis of these subheadings followed, filling\nseveral pages, and the memorandum ended with a final exhortation to the\ngentlemen: \"If they will duly appreciate the responsibility of their\nposition, and taking the points above laid down as the outline, will\nexercise their own good sense in acting UPON ALL OCCASIONS all\nupon these principles, thinking no point of detail too minute to be\nimportant, but maintaining one steady consistent line of conduct\nthey may render essential service to the young Prince and justify the\nflattering selection made by the royal parents.\" A year later the young\nPrince was sent to Oxford, where the greatest care was taken that\nhe should not mix with the undergraduates. Yes, everything had been\ntried--everything... with one single exception. The experiment had never\nbeen made of letting Bertie enjoy himself.

In his stiff chair\nby the fire he nodded now over old stories--not of emperors and\ngenerals--but of neighbours and relatives and the domestic adventures\nof long ago--the burning of his father's library--and the goat that ran\nupstairs to his sister's room and ran twice round the table and then ran\ndown again.

He was wearing himself out in the service of\nthe country; and certainly his constitution, as Stockmar had perceived\nfrom the first, was ill-adapted to meet a serious strain. He was easily\nupset; he constantly suffered from minor ailments. His appearance in\nitself was enough to indicate the infirmity of his physical powers. The\nhandsome youth of twenty years since with the flashing eyes and the soft\ncomplexion had grown into a sallow, tired-looking man, whose body, in\nits stoop and its loose fleshiness, betrayed the sedentary labourer,\nand whose head was quite bald on the top. Unkind critics, who had once\ncompared Albert to an operatic tenor, might have remarked that there was\nsomething of the butler about him now. Beside Victoria, he presented a\npainful contrast. She, too, was stout, but it was with the plumpness of\na vigorous matron; and an eager vitality was everywhere visible--in her\nenergetic bearing, her protruding, enquiring glances, her small, fat,\ncapable, and commanding hands. If only, by some sympathetic magic, she\ncould have conveyed into that portly, flabby figure, that desiccated and\ndiscouraged brain, a measure of the stamina and the self-assurance which\nwere so pre-eminently hers!\nBut suddenly she was reminded that there were other perils besides those\nof ill-health. During a visit to Coburg in 1860, the Prince was very\nnearly killed in a carriage accident. He escaped with a few cuts and\nbruises; but Victoria's alarm was extreme, though she concealed it. \"It\nis when the Queen feels most deeply,\" she wrote afterwards, \"that she\nalways appears calmest, and she could not and dared not allow herself\nto speak of what might have been, or even to admit to herself (and she\ncannot and dare not now) the entire danger, for her head would turn!\"\nHer agitation, in fact, was only surpassed by her thankfulness to God.\nShe felt, she said, that she could not rest \"without doing something to\nmark permanently her feelings,\" and she decided that she would endow a\ncharity in Coburg. \"L1,000, or even L2,000, given either at once, or\nin instalments yearly, would not, in the Queen's opinion, be too much.\"\nEventually, the smaller sum having been fixed upon, it was invested in\na trust, called the \"Victoria-Stift,\" in the name of the Burgomaster and",

On his return, it was clear that the fatigue and exposure to\nwhich he had been subjected had seriously affected his health. He was\nattacked by rheumatism, his sleeplessness continued, and he complained\nthat he felt thoroughly unwell. Three days later a painful duty obliged\nhim to visit Cambridge. The Prince of Wales, who had been placed at that\nUniversity in the previous year, was behaving in such a manner that\na parental visit and a parental admonition had become necessary. The\ndisappointed father, suffering in mind and body, carried through his\ntask; but, on his return journey to Windsor, he caught a fatal chill.\nDuring the next week he gradually grew weaker and more miserable. Yet,\ndepressed and enfeebled as he was, he continued to work. It so happened\nthat at that very moment a grave diplomatic crisis had arisen. Civil\nwar had broken out in America, and it seemed as if England, owing to a\nviolent quarrel with the Northern States, was upon the point of being\ndrawn into the conflict. A severe despatch by Lord John Russell was\nsubmitted to the Queen; and the Prince perceived that, if it was sent\noff unaltered, war would be the almost inevitable consequence. At seven\no'clock on the morning of December 1, he rose from his bed, and with a\nquavering hand wrote a series of suggestions for the alteration of the\ndraft, by which its language might be softened, and a way left open for\na peaceful solution of the question. These changes were accepted by the\nGovernment, and war was averted. It was the Prince's last memorandum.\nHe had always declared that he viewed the prospect of death with\nequanimity. \"I do not cling to life,\" he had once said to Victoria. \"You\ndo; but I set no store by it.\" And then he had added: \"I am sure, if I\nhad a severe illness, I should give up at once, I should not struggle\nfor life. I have no tenacity of life.\" He had judged correctly. Before\nhe had been ill many days, he told a friend that he was convinced he\nwould not recover. He sank and sank. Nevertheless, if his case had\nbeen properly understood and skilfully treated from the first, he might\nconceivably have been saved; but the doctors failed to diagnose his\nsymptoms; and it is noteworthy that his principal physician was Sir\nJames Clark. When it was suggested that other advice should be taken,\nSir James pooh-poohed the idea: \"there was no cause for alarm,\" he said.\nBut the strange illness grew worse. At last, after a letter of fierce\nremonstrance from Palmerston, Dr. Watson was sent for; and Dr. Watson\nsaw at once that he had come too late The Prince was in the grip of\ntyphoid fever. \"I think that everything so far is satisfactory,\" said\nSir James Clark.(*)\n(*) Clarendon, II, 253-4: \"One cannot speak with certainty;\nbut it is horrible to think that such a life MAY have been\nsacrificed to Sir J. Clark's selfish jealousy of every\nmember of his profession.\" The Earl of Clarendon to the\nDuchess of Manchester, December 17, 1861.\nThe restlessness and the acute suffering of the earlier days gave place\nto a settled torpor and an ever--deepening gloom. Once the failing\npatient asked for music--\"a fine chorale at a distance;\" and a piano\nhaving been placed in the adjoining room, Princess Alice played on it\nsome of Luther's hymns, after which the Prince repeated \"The Rock of\nAges.\" Sometimes his mind wandered; sometimes the distant past came\nrushing upon him; he heard the birds in the early morning, and was at\nRosenau again, a boy. Or Victoria would come and read to him \"Peveril\nof the Peak,\" and he showed that he could follow the story, and then she\nwould bend over him, and he would murmur \"liebes Frauchen\" and \"gutes\nWeibchen,\" stroking her cheek. Her distress and her agitation were\ngreat, but she was not seriously frightened. Buoyed up by her own\nabundant energies, she would not believe that Albert's might prove\nunequal to the strain. She refused to face such a hideous possibility.\nShe declined to see Dr. Watson. Why should she? Had not Sir James Clark\nassured her that all would be well? Only two days before the end, which\nwas seen now to be almost inevitable by everyone about her, she wrote,\nfull of apparent confidence, to the King of the Belgians: \"I do not sit\nup with him at night,\" she said, \"as I could be of no use; and there is\nnothing to cause alarm.\" The Princess Alice tried to tell her the truth,\nbut her hopefulness would not be daunted. On the morning of December\n14, Albert, just as she had expected, seemed to be better; perhaps\nthe crisis was over. But in the course of the day there was a serious\nrelapse. Then at last she allowed herself to see that she was standing\non the edge of an appalling gulf. The whole family was summoned, and,\none after another, the children took a silent farewell of their father.\n\"It was a terrible moment,\" Victoria wrote in her diary, \"but, thank\nGod! I was able to command myself, and to be perfectly calm, and\nremained sitting by his side.\" He murmured something, but she could not\nhear what it was; she thought he was speaking in French. Then all at\nonce he began to arrange his hair, \"just as he used to do when well and\nhe was dressing.\" \"Es kleines Frauchen,\" she whispered to him; and he\nseemed to understand. For a moment, towards the evening, she went into\nanother room, but was immediately called back; she saw at a glance that\na ghastly change had taken place. As she knelt by the bed, he breathed\ndeeply, breathed gently, breathed at last no more. His features became\nperfectly rigid; she shrieked one long wild shriek that rang through the\nterror-stricken castle and understood that she had lost him for ever.",

            "text": "I\nThe death of the Prince Consort was the central turning-point in the\nhistory of Queen Victoria. She herself felt that her true life had\nceased with her husband's, and that the remainder of her days upon earth\nwas of a twilight nature--an epilogue to a drama that was done. Nor is\nit possible that her biographer should escape a similar impression. For\nhim, too, there is a darkness over the latter half of that long career.\nThe first forty--two years of the Queen's life are illuminated by a\ngreat and varied quantity of authentic information. With Albert's\ndeath a veil descends. Only occasionally, at fitful and disconnected\nintervals, does it lift for a moment or two; a few main outlines, a\nfew remarkable details may be discerned; the rest is all conjecture and\nambiguity. Thus, though the Queen survived her great bereavement for\nalmost as many years as she had lived before it, the chronicle of those\nyears can bear no proportion to the tale of her earlier life. We must be\ncontent in our ignorance with a brief and summary relation.\nThe sudden removal of the Prince was not merely a matter of overwhelming\npersonal concern to Victoria; it was an event of national, of European\nimportance. He was only forty-two, and in the ordinary course of nature\nhe might have been expected to live at least thirty years longer. Had\nhe done so it can hardly be doubted that the whole development of the\nEnglish polity would have been changed. Already at the time of his death\nhe filled a unique place in English public life; already among the inner\ncircle of politicians he was accepted as a necessary and useful part of\nthe mechanism of the State. Lord Clarendon, for instance, spoke of his\ndeath as \"a national calamity of far greater importance than the public\ndream of,\" and lamented the loss of his \"sagacity and foresight,\" which,\nhe declared, would have been \"more than ever valuable\" in the event of\nan American war. And, as time went on, the Prince's influence must have\nenormously increased. For, in addition to his intellectual and moral\nqualities, he enjoyed, by virtue of his position, one supreme advantage\nwhich every other holder of high office in the country was without: he\nwas permanent. Politicians came and went, but the Prince was perpetually\ninstalled at the centre of affairs. Who can doubt that, towards the end\nof the century, such a man, grown grey in the service of the nation,\nvirtuous, intelligent, and with the unexampled experience of a whole\nlife-time of government, would have acquired an extraordinary prestige?\nIf, in his youth, he had been able to pit the Crown against the mighty\nPalmerston and to come off with equal honours from the contest, of what\nmight he not have been capable in his old age? What Minister,\nhowever able, however popular, could have withstood the wisdom, the\nirreproachability, the vast prescriptive authority, of the venerable\nPrince? It is easy to imagine how, under such a ruler, an attempt might\nhave been made to convert England into a State as exactly organised,\nas elaborately trained, as efficiently equipped, and as autocratically\ncontrolled, as Prussia herself. Then perhaps, eventually, under some\npowerful leader--a Gladstone or a Bright--the democratic forces in the\ncountry might have rallied together, and a struggle might have followed\nin which the Monarchy would have been shaken to its foundations. Or, on\nthe other hand, Disraeli's hypothetical prophecy might have come true.\n\"With Prince Albert,\" he said, \"we have buried our... sovereign. This\nGerman Prince has governed England for twenty-one years with a wisdom\nand energy such as none of our kings have ever shown. If he had outlived\nsome of our 'old stagers' he would have given us the blessings of\nabsolute government.\"\nThe English Constitution--that indescribable entity--is a living thing,\ngrowing with the growth of men, and assuming ever-varying forms in\naccordance with the subtle and complex laws of human character. It is\nthe child of wisdom and chance. The wise men of 1688 moulded it into the\nshape we know, but the chance that George I could not speak English\ngave it one of its essential peculiarities--the system of a Cabinet\nindependent of the Crown and subordinate to the Prime Minister. The\nwisdom of Lord Grey saved it from petrifaction and destruction, and\nset it upon the path of Democracy. Then chance intervened once more; a\nfemale sovereign happened to marry an able and pertinacious man; and\nit seemed likely that an element which had been quiescent within it for\nyears--the element of irresponsible administrative power--was about\nto become its predominant characteristic and to change completely the\ndirection of its growth. But what chance gave chance took away. The\nConsort perished in his prime; and the English Constitution, dropping\nthe dead limb with hardly a tremor, continued its mysterious life as if\nhe had never been.\nOne human being, and one alone, felt the full force of what had\nhappened. The Baron, by his fireside at Coburg, suddenly saw the\ntremendous fabric of his creation crash down into sheer and irremediable\nruin. Albert was gone, and he had lived in vain. Even his blackest\nhypochondria had never envisioned quite so miserable a catastrophe.\nVictoria wrote to him, visited him, tried to console him by declaring\nwith passionate conviction that she would carry on her husband's work.\nHe smiled a sad smile and looked into the fire. Then he murmured that\nhe was going where Albert was--that he would not be long. He shrank into\nhimself. His children clustered round him and did their best to comfort\nhim, but it was useless: the Baron's heart was broken. He lingered for\neighteen months, and then, with his pupil, explored the shadow and the",

            "text": "II\nWith appalling suddenness Victoria had exchanged the serene radiance of\nhappiness for the utter darkness of woe. In the first dreadful moments\nthose about her had feared that she might lose her reason, but the iron\nstrain within her held firm, and in the intervals between the intense\nparoxysms of grief it was observed that the Queen was calm. She\nremembered, too, that Albert had always disapproved of exaggerated\nmanifestations of feeling, and her one remaining desire was to do\nnothing but what he would have wished. Yet there were moments when\nher royal anguish would brook no restraints. One day she sent for the\nDuchess of Sutherland, and, leading her to the Prince's room, fell\nprostrate before his clothes in a flood of weeping, while she adjured\nthe Duchess to tell her whether the beauty of Albert's character had\never been surpassed. At other times a feeling akin to indignation swept\nover her. \"The poor fatherless baby of eight months,\" she wrote to the\nKing of the Belgians, \"is now the utterly heartbroken and crushed widow\nof forty-two! My LIFE as a HAPPY one is ENDED! The world is gone for\nME!... Oh! to be cut off in the prime of life--to see our pure, happy,\nquiet, domestic life, which ALONE enabled me to bear my MUCH disliked\nposition, CUT OFF at forty-two--when I HAD hoped with such instinctive\ncertainty that God never WOULD part us, and would let us grow old\ntogether (though HE always talked of the shortness of life)--is TOO\nAWFUL, too cruel!\" The tone of outraged Majesty seems to be discernible.\nDid she wonder in her heart of hearts how the Deity could have dared?\nBut all other emotions gave way before her overmastering determination\nto continue, absolutely unchanged, and for the rest of her life on\nearth, her reverence, her obedience, her idolatry. \"I am anxious to\nrepeat ONE thing,\" she told her uncle, \"and THAT ONE is my firm resolve,\nmy IRREVOCABLE DECISION, viz., that HIS wishes--HIS plans--about\neverything, HIS views about EVERY thing are to be MY LAW! And NO HUMAN\nPOWER will make me swerve from WHAT HE decided and wished.\" She grew\nfierce, she grew furious, at the thought of any possible intrusion\nbetween her and her desire. Her uncle was coming to visit her, and it\nflashed upon her that HE might try to interfere with her and seek\nto \"rule the roost\" as of old. She would give him a hint. \"I am ALSO\nDETERMINED,\" she wrote, \"that NO ONE person--may HE be ever so good,\never so devoted among my servants--is to lead or guide or dictate TO ME.\nI know HOW he would disapprove it... Though miserably weak and utterly\nshattered, my spirit rises when I think ANY wish or plan of his is to\nbe touched or changed, or I am to be MADE TO DO anything.\" She ended her\nletter in grief and affection. She was, she said, his \"ever wretched but\ndevoted child, Victoria R.\" And then she looked at the date: it was the\n24th of December. An agonising pang assailed her, and she dashed down a\npostcript--\"What a Xmas! I won't think of it.\"\nAt first, in the tumult of her distresses, she declared that she could\nnot see her Ministers, and the Princess Alice, assisted by Sir Charles\nPhipps, the keeper of the Privy Purse, performed, to the best of her\nability, the functions of an intermediary. After a few weeks, however,\nthe Cabinet, through Lord John Russell, ventured to warn the Queen that\nthis could not continue. She realised that they were right: Albert would\nhave agreed with them; and so she sent for the Prime Minister. But when\nLord Palmerston arrived at Osborne, in the pink of health, brisk, with\nhis whiskers freshly dyed, and dressed in a brown overcoat, light grey\ntrousers, green gloves, and blue studs, he did not create a very good\nimpression.\nNevertheless, she had grown attached to her old enemy, and the thought\nof a political change filled her with agitated apprehensions. The\nGovernment, she knew, might fall at any moment; she felt she could not\nface such an eventuality; and therefore, six months after the death of\nthe Prince, she took the unprecedented step of sending a private message\nto Lord Derby, the leader of the Opposition, to tell him that she was\nnot in a fit state of mind or body to undergo the anxiety of a change of\nGovernment, and that if he turned the present Ministers out of office it\nwould be at the risk of sacrificing her life--or her reason. When this\nmessage reached Lord Derby he was considerably surprised. \"Dear me!\" was\nhis cynical comment. \"I didn't think she was so fond of them as THAT.\"\nThough the violence of her perturbations gradually subsided, her\ncheerfulness did not return. For months, for years, she continued in\nsettled gloom. Her life became one of almost complete seclusion. Arrayed\nin thickest crepe, she passed dolefully from Windsor to Osborne, from\nOsborne to Balmoral. Rarely visiting the capital, refusing to take any\npart in the ceremonies of state, shutting herself off from the slightest\nintercourse with society, she became almost as unknown to her subjects\nas some potentate of the East. They might murmur, but they did not\nunderstand. What had she to do with empty shows and vain enjoyments? No!\nShe was absorbed by very different preoccupations. She was the devoted\nguardian of a sacred trust. Her place was in the inmost shrine of the\nhouse of mourning--where she alone had the right to enter, where she\ncould feel the effluence of a mysterious presence, and interpret,\nhowever faintly and feebly, the promptings of a still living soul. That,\nand that only was her glorious, her terrible duty. For terrible indeed\nit was. As the years passed her depression seemed to deepen and her\nloneliness to grow more intense. \"I am on a dreary sad pinnacle of\nsolitary grandeur,\" she said. Again and again she felt that she could\nbear her situation no longer--that she would sink under the strain. And\nthen, instantly, that Voice spoke: and she braced herself once more to\nperform, with minute conscientiousness, her grim and holy task.",

That vast burden of toil which he had taken upon\nhis shoulders it was now for her to bear. She assumed the gigantic\nload; and naturally she staggered under it. While he had lived, she had\nworked, indeed, with regularity and conscientiousness; but it was work\nmade easy, made delicious, by his care, his forethought, his advice,\nand his infallibility. The mere sound of his voice, asking her to sign\na paper, had thrilled her; in such a presence she could have laboured\ngladly for ever. But now there was a hideous change. Now there were no\nneat piles and docketings under the green lamp; now there were no simple\nexplanations of difficult matters; now there was nobody to tell her what\nwas right and what was wrong. She had her secretaries, no doubt: there\nwere Sir Charles Phipps, and General Grey, and Sir Thomas Biddulph; and\nthey did their best. But they were mere subordinates: the whole weight\nof initiative and responsibility rested upon her alone. For so it had to\nbe. \"I am DETERMINED\"--had she not declared it?--\"that NO ONE person is\nto lead or guide or dictate to ME;\" anything else would be a betrayal of\nher trust. She would follow the Prince in all things. He had refused to\ndelegate authority; he had examined into every detail with his own eyes;\nhe had made it a rule never to sign a paper without having first, not\nmerely read it, but made notes on it too. She would do the same. She\nsat from morning till night surrounded by huge heaps of despatch--boxes,\nreading and writing at her desk--at her desk, alas! which stood alone\nnow in the room.\nWithin two years of Albert's death a violent disturbance in foreign\npolitics put Victoria's faithfulness to a crucial test. The fearful\nSchleswig-Holstein dispute, which had been smouldering for more than a\ndecade, showed signs of bursting out into conflagration. The complexity\nof the questions at issue was indescribable. \"Only three people,\"\nsaid Palmerston, \"have ever really understood the Schleswig-Holstein\nbusiness--the Prince Consort, who is dead--a German professor, who\nhas gone mad--and I, who have forgotten all about it.\" But, though the\nPrince might be dead, had he not left a vicegerent behind him?\nVictoria threw herself into the seething embroilment with the vigour of\ninspiration. She devoted hours daily to the study of the affair in all\nits windings; but she had a clue through the labyrinth: whenever the\nquestion had been discussed, Albert, she recollected it perfectly, had\nalways taken the side of Prussia. Her course was clear. She became an\nardent champion of the Prussian point of view. It was a legacy from the\nPrince, she said. She did not realise that the Prussia of the Prince's\nday was dead, and that a new Prussia, the Prussia of Bismarck, was born.\nPerhaps Palmerston, with his queer prescience, instinctively apprehended\nthe new danger; at any rate, he and Lord John were agreed upon the\nnecessity of supporting Denmark against Prussia's claims. But opinion\nwas sharply divided, not only in the country but in the Cabinet. For\neighteen months the controversy raged; while the Queen, with persistent\nvehemence, opposed the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary. When at\nlast the final crisis arose--when it seemed possible that England would\njoin forces with Denmark in a war against Prussia--Victoria's agitation\ngrew febrile in its intensity. Towards her German relatives she\npreserved a discreet appearance of impartiality; but she poured out\nupon her Ministers a flood of appeals, protests, and expostulations. She\ninvoked the sacred cause of Peace. \"The only chance of preserving peace\nfor Europe,\" she wrote, \"is by not assisting Denmark, who has brought\nthis entirely upon herself. The Queen suffers much, and her nerves\nare more and more totally shattered... But though all this anxiety is\nwearing her out, it will not shake her firm purpose of resisting any\nattempt to involve this country in a mad and useless combat.\" She was,\nshe declared, \"prepared to make a stand,\" even if the resignation of the\nForeign Secretary should follow. \"The Queen,\" she told Lord Granville,\n\"is completely exhausted by the anxiety and suspense, and misses her\nbeloved husband's help, advice, support, and love in an overwhelming\nmanner.\" She was so worn out by her efforts for peace that she could\n\"hardly hold up her head or hold her pen.\" England did not go to war,\nand Denmark was left to her fate; but how far the attitude of the Queen\ncontributed to this result it is impossible, with our present knowledge,\nto say. On the whole, however, it seems probable that the determining\nfactor in the situation was the powerful peace party in the Cabinet\nrather than the imperious and pathetic pressure of Victoria.",

Her eyes were opened to the true nature of Prussia,\nwhose designs upon Austria were about to culminate in the Seven Weeks'\nWar. Veering precipitately from one extreme to the other, she now urged\nher Ministers to interfere by force of arms in support of Austria. But\nshe urged in vain.\nHer political activity, no more than her social seclusion, was approved\nby the public. As the years passed, and the royal mourning remained\nas unrelieved as ever, the animadversions grew more general and more\nsevere. It was observed that the Queen's protracted privacy not only\ncast a gloom over high society, not only deprived the populace of its\npageantry, but also exercised a highly deleterious effect upon the\ndressmaking, millinery, and hosiery trades. This latter consideration\ncarried great weight. At last, early in 1864, the rumour spread that Her\nMajesty was about to go out of mourning, and there was much rejoicing\nin the newspapers; but unfortunately it turned out that the rumour was\nquite without foundation. Victoria, with her own hand, wrote a letter\nto The Times to say so. \"This idea,\" she declared, \"cannot be too\nexplicitly contradicted. The Queen,\" the letter continued, \"heartily\nappreciates the desire of her subjects to see her, and whatever she CAN\ndo to gratify them in this loyal and affectionate wish, she WILL do...\nBut there are other and higher duties than those of mere representation\nwhich are now thrown upon the Queen, alone and unassisted--duties which\nshe cannot neglect without injury to the public service, which weigh\nunceasingly upon her, overwhelming her with work and anxiety.\" The\njustification might have been considered more cogent had it not been\nknown that those \"other and higher duties\" emphasised by the Queen\nconsisted for the most part of an attempt to counteract the\nforeign policy of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell. A large\nsection--perhaps a majority--of the nation were violent partisans of\nDenmark in the Schleswig-Holstein quarrel; and Victoria's support of\nPrussia was widely denounced. A wave of unpopularity, which reminded\nold observers of the period preceding the Queen's marriage more than\ntwenty-five years before, was beginning to rise. The press was rude;\nLord Ellenborough attacked the Queen in the House of Lords; there\nwere curious whispers in high quarters that she had had thoughts of\nabdicating--whispers followed by regrets that she had not done so.\nVictoria, outraged and injured, felt that she was misunderstood. She\nwas profoundly unhappy. After Lord Ellenborough's speech, General Grey\ndeclared that he \"had never seen the Queen so completely upset.\"\n\"Oh, how fearful it is,\" she herself wrote to Lord Granville, \"to be\nsuspected--uncheered--unguided and unadvised--and how alone the poor\nQueen feels!\" Nevertheless, suffer as she might, she was as resolute\nas ever; she would not move by a hair's breadth from the course that a\nsupreme obligation marked out for her; she would be faithful to the end.\nAnd so, when Schleswig-Holstein was forgotten, and even the image of the\nPrince had begun to grow dim in the fickle memories of men, the solitary\nwatcher remained immutably concentrated at her peculiar task. The\nworld's hostility, steadily increasing, was confronted and outfaced by\nthe impenetrable weeds of Victoria. Would the world never understand?\nIt was not mere sorrow that kept her so strangely sequestered; it was\ndevotion, it was self-immolation; it was the laborious legacy of love.",

            "text": "Unceasingly the pen moved over the black-edged paper. The flesh might be\nweak, but that vast burden must be borne. And fortunately, if the world\nwould not understand, there were faithful friends who did. There was\nLord Granville, and there was kind Mr. Theodore Martin. Perhaps Mr.\nMartin, who was so clever, would find means to make people realise the\nfacts. She would send him a letter, pointing out her arduous labours and\nthe difficulties under which she struggled, and then he might write an\narticle for one of the magazines. \"It is not,\" she told him in 1863,\n\"the Queen's SORROW that keeps her secluded. It is her OVERWHELMING WORK\nand her health, which is greatly shaken by her sorrow, and the totally\noverwhelming amount of work and responsibility--work which she feels\nreally wears her out. Alice Helps was wonderfully struck at the Queen's\nroom; and if Mrs. Martin will look at it, she can tell Mr. Martin what\nsurrounds her. From the hour she gets out of bed till she gets into it\nagain there is work, work, work,--letter-boxes, questions, etc., which\nare dreadfully exhausting--and if she had not comparative rest and\nquiet in the evening she would most likely not be ALIVE. Her brain is\nconstantly overtaxed.\" It was too true.\nIII\nTo carry on Albert's work--that was her first duty; but there was\nanother, second only to that, and yet nearer, if possible, to her\nheart--to impress the true nature of his genius and character upon the\nminds of her subjects. She realised that during his life he had not been\nproperly appreciated; the full extent of his powers, the supreme quality\nof his goodness, had been necessarily concealed; but death had removed\nthe need of barriers, and now her husband, in his magnificent entirety,\nshould stand revealed to all. She set to work methodically. She directed\nSir Arthur Helps to bring out a collection of the Prince's speeches and\naddresses, and the weighty tome appeared in 1862. Then she commanded\nGeneral Grey to write an account of the Prince's early years--from his\nbirth to his marriage; she herself laid down the design of the book,\ncontributed a number of confidential documents, and added numerous\nnotes; General Grey obeyed, and the work was completed in 1866. But\nthe principal part of the story was still untold, and Mr. Martin\nwas forthwith instructed to write a complete biography of the Prince\nConsort. Mr. Martin laboured for fourteen years. The mass of material\nwith which he had to deal was almost incredible, but he was extremely\nindustrious, and he enjoyed throughout the gracious assistance of Her\nMajesty. The first bulky volume was published in 1874; four others\nslowly followed; so that it was not until 1880 that the monumental work\nwas finished.\nMr. Martin was rewarded by a knighthood; and yet it was sadly evident\nthat neither Sir Theodore nor his predecessors had achieved the\npurpose which the Queen had in view. Perhaps she was unfortunate in her\ncoadjutors, but, in reality, the responsibility for the failure must lie\nwith Victoria herself. Sir Theodore and the others faithfully carried\nout the task which she had set them--faithfully put before the public\nthe very image of Albert that filled her own mind. The fatal drawback\nwas that the public did not find that image attractive. Victoria's\nemotional nature, far more remarkable for vigour than for subtlety,\nrejecting utterly the qualifications which perspicuity, or humour,\nmight suggest, could be satisfied with nothing but the absolute and the\ncategorical. When she disliked she did so with an unequivocal emphasis\nwhich swept the object of her repugnance at once and finally outside\nthe pale of consideration; and her feelings of affection were equally\nunmitigated. In the case of Albert her passion for superlatives\nreached its height. To have conceived of him as anything short of\nperfect--perfect in virtue, in wisdom, in beauty, in all the glories and\ngraces of man--would have been an unthinkable blasphemy: perfect he\nwas, and perfect he must be shown to have been. And so, Sir Arthur, Sir\nTheodore, and the General painted him. In the circumstances, and under\nsuch supervision, to have done anything else would have required talents\nconsiderably more distinguished than any that those gentlemen possessed.\nBut that was not all. By a curious mischance Victoria was also able to\npress into her service another writer, the distinction of whose talents\nwas this time beyond a doubt. The Poet Laureate, adopting, either from\ncomplaisance or conviction, the tone of his sovereign, joined in the\nchorus, and endowed the royal formula with the magical resonance of\nverse. This settled the matter. Henceforward it was impossible to forget\nthat Albert had worn the white flower of a blameless life.\nThe result was doubly unfortunate. Victoria, disappointed and chagrined,\nbore a grudge against her people for their refusal, in spite of all her\nefforts, to rate her husband at his true worth. She did not understand\nthat the picture of an embodied perfection is distasteful to the\nmajority of mankind. The cause of this is not so much an envy of the\nperfect being as a suspicion that he must be inhuman; and thus it\nhappened that the public, when it saw displayed for its admiration a\nfigure resembling the sugary hero of a moral story-book rather than a\nfellow man of flesh and blood, turned away with a shrug, a smile, and\na flippant ejaculation. But in this the public was the loser as well as\nVictoria. For in truth Albert was a far more interesting personage than\nthe public dreamed. By a curious irony an impeccable waxwork had been\nfixed by the Queen's love in the popular imagination, while the creature\nwhom it represented--the real creature, so full of energy and stress\nand torment, so mysterious and so unhappy, and so fallible and so very\nhuman--had altogether disappeared.\nIV\nWords and books may be ambiguous memorials; but who can misinterpret the\nvisible solidity of bronze and stone? At Frogmore, near Windsor, where\nher mother was buried, Victoria constructed, at the cost of L200,000, a\nvast and elaborate mausoleum for herself and her husband. But that was\na private and domestic monument, and the Queen desired that wherever\nher subjects might be gathered together they should be reminded of the\nPrince. Her desire was gratified; all over the country--at Aberdeen, at\nPerth, and at Wolverhampton--statues of the Prince were erected; and\nthe Queen, making an exception to her rule of retirement, unveiled them\nherself. Nor did the capital lag behind. A month after the Prince's\ndeath a meeting was called together at the Mansion House to discuss\nschemes for honouring his memory. Opinions, however, were divided upon\nthe subject. Was a statue or an institution to be preferred? Meanwhile a\nsubscription was opened; an influential committee was appointed, and the\nQueen was consulted as to her wishes in the matter. Her Majesty replied\nthat she would prefer a granite obelisk, with sculptures at the base, to\nan institution. But the committee hesitated: an obelisk, to be worthy\nof the name, must clearly be a monolith; and where was the quarry in\nEngland capable of furnishing a granite block of the required size? It\nwas true that there was granite in Russian Finland; but the committee\nwere advised that it was not adapted to resist exposure to the open air.\nOn the whole, therefore, they suggested that a Memorial Hall should be\nerected, together with a statue of the Prince. Her Majesty assented; but\nthen another difficulty arose. It was found that not more than L60,000\nhad been subscribed--a sum insufficient to defray the double expense.\nThe Hall, therefore, was abandoned; a statue alone was to be erected;\nand certain eminent architects were asked to prepare designs. Eventually\nthe committee had at their disposal a total sum of L120,000, since\nthe public subscribed another L10,000, while L50,000 was voted by\nParliament. Some years later a joint stock company was formed and built,\nas a private speculation, the Albert Hall.\nThe architect whose design was selected, both by the committee and by\nthe Queen, was Mr. Gilbert Scott, whose industry, conscientiousness,\nand genuine piety had brought him to the head of his profession.\nHis lifelong zeal for the Gothic style having given him a special\nprominence, his handiwork was strikingly visible, not only in a\nmultitude of original buildings, but in most of the cathedrals of\nEngland. Protests, indeed, were occasionally raised against his\nrenovations; but Mr. Scott replied with such vigour and unction in\narticles and pamphlets that not a Dean was unconvinced, and he was\npermitted to continue his labours without interruption. On one occasion,\nhowever, his devotion to Gothic had placed him in an unpleasant\nsituation. The Government offices in Whitehall were to be rebuilt; Mr.\nScott competed, and his designs were successful. Naturally, they were in\nthe Gothic style, combining \"a certain squareness and horizontality of\noutline\" with pillar-mullions, gables, high-pitched roofs, and dormers;\nand the drawings, as Mr. Scott himself observed, \"were, perhaps, the\nbest ever sent in to a competition, or nearly so.\" After the usual\ndifficulties and delays the work was at last to be put in hand, when\nthere was a change of Government and Lord Palmerston became Prime\nMinister. Lord Palmerston at once sent for Mr. Scott. \"Well, Mr. Scott,\"\nhe said, in his jaunty way, \"I can't have anything to do with this\nGothic style. I must insist on your making a design in the Italian\nmanner, which I am sure you can do very cleverly.\" Mr. Scott was\nappalled; the style of the Italian renaissance was not only unsightly,\nit was positively immoral, and he sternly refused to have anything to do\nwith it. Thereupon Lord Palmerston assumed a fatherly tone. \"Quite true;\na Gothic architect can't be expected to put up a Classical building;\nI must find someone else.\" This was intolerable, and Mr. Scott, on his\nreturn home, addressed to the Prime Minister a strongly-worded letter,\nin which he dwelt upon his position as an architect, upon his having won\ntwo European competitions, his being an A.R.A., a gold medallist of the\nInstitute, and a lecturer on architecture at the Royal Academy; but it\nwas useless--Lord Palmerston did not even reply. It then occurred to\nMr. Scott that, by a judicious mixture, he might, while preserving the\nessential character of the Gothic, produce a design which would give a\nsuperficial impression of the Classical style. He did so, but no effect\nwas produced upon Lord Palmerston. The new design, he said, was \"neither\none thing nor 'tother--a regular mongrel affair--and he would have\nnothing to do with it either.\" After that Mr. Scott found it necessary\nto recruit for two months at Scarborough, \"with a course of quinine.\" He\nrecovered his tone at last, but only at the cost of his convictions. For\nthe sake of his family he felt that it was his unfortunate duty to obey\nthe Prime Minister; and, shuddering with horror, he constructed the\nGovernment offices in a strictly Renaissance style.\nShortly afterwards Mr. Scott found some consolation in building the St.\nPancras Hotel in a style of his own.\nAnd now another and yet more satisfactory task was his. \"My idea in\ndesigning the Memorial,\" he wrote, \"was to erect a kind of ciborium to\nprotect a statue of the Prince; and its special characteristic was\nthat the ciborium was designed in some degree on the principles of the\nancient shrines. These shrines were models of imaginary buildings, such\nas had never in reality been erected; and my idea was to realise one of\nthese imaginary structures with its precious materials, its inlaying,\nits enamels, etc. etc.\" His idea was particularly appropriate since\nit chanced that a similar conception, though in the reverse order of\nmagnitude, had occurred to the Prince himself, who had designed and\nexecuted several silver cruet-stands upon the same model. At the Queen's\nrequest a site was chosen in Kensington Gardens as near as possible\nto that of the Great Exhibition; and in May, 1864, the first sod was\nturned. The work was long, complicated, and difficult; a great number\nof workmen were employed, besides several subsidiary sculptors and\nmetal--workers under Mr. Scott's direction, while at every stage\nsketches and models were submitted to Her Majesty, who criticised all\nthe details with minute care, and constantly suggested improvements. The\nfrieze, which encircled the base of the monument, was in itself a very\nserious piece of work. \"This,\" said Mr. Scott, \"taken as a whole, is\nperhaps one of the most laborious works of sculpture ever undertaken,\nconsisting, as it does, of a continuous range of figure-sculpture of the\nmost elaborate description, in the highest alto-relievo of life-size, of\nmore than 200 feet in length, containing about 170 figures, and executed\nin the hardest marble which could be procured.\" After three years of\ntoil the memorial was still far from completion, and Mr. Scott thought\nit advisable to give a dinner to the workmen, \"as a substantial\nrecognition of his appreciation of their skill and energy.\" \"Two long\ntables,\" we are told, \"constructed of scaffold planks, were arranged in\nthe workshops, and covered with newspapers, for want of table-cloths.\nUpwards of eighty men sat down. Beef and mutton, plum pudding and cheese\nwere supplied in abundance, and each man who desired it had three pints\nof beer, gingerbeer and lemonade being provided for the teetotalers, who\nformed a very considerable proportion... Several toasts were given and\nmany of the workmen spoke, almost all of them commencing by 'Thanking\nGod that they enjoyed good health;' some alluded to the temperance that\nprevailed amongst them, others observed how little swearing was ever\nheard, whilst all said how pleased and proud they were to be engaged on\nso great a work.\"\nGradually the edifice approached completion. The one hundred and\nseventieth life-size figure in the frieze was chiselled, the granite\npillars arose, the mosaics were inserted in the allegorical pediments,\nthe four colossal statues representing the greater Christian virtues,\nthe four other colossal statues representing the greater moral virtues,\nwere hoisted into their positions, the eight bronzes representing the\ngreater sciences--Astronomy, Chemistry, Geology, Geometry, Rhetoric,\nMedicine, Philosophy, and Physiology--were fixed on their glittering\npinnacles, high in air. The statue of Physiology was particularly\nadmired. \"On her left arm,\" the official description informs us, \"she\nbears a new-born infant, as a representation of the development of the\nhighest and most perfect of physiological forms; her hand points\ntowards a microscope, the instrument which lends its assistance for the\ninvestigation of the minuter forms of animal and vegetable organisms.\"\nAt last the gilded cross crowned the dwindling galaxies of superimposed\nangels, the four continents in white marble stood at the four corners\nof the base, and, seven years after its inception, in July, 1872, the\nmonument was thrown open to the public.",

For a moment she hoped that the House of Lords would come to\nthe rescue; the Peers opposed the change with unexpected vigour; but Mr.\nGladstone, more conscious than ever of the support of the Almighty, was\nready with an ingenious device. The purchase of commissions had been\noriginally allowed by Royal Warrant; it should now be disallowed by the\nsame agency. Victoria was faced by a curious dilemma: she abominated the\nabolition of purchase; but she was asked to abolish it by an exercise of\nsovereign power which was very much to her taste. She did not hesitate\nfor long; and when the Cabinet, in a formal minute, advised her to sign\nthe Warrant, she did so with a good grace.\nUnacceptable as Mr. Gladstone's policy was, there was something else\nabout him which was even more displeasing to Victoria. She disliked his\npersonal demeanour towards herself. It was not that Mr. Gladstone,\nin his intercourse with her, was in any degree lacking in courtesy or\nrespect. On the contrary, an extraordinary reverence impregnated\nhis manner, both in his conversation and his correspondence with the\nSovereign. Indeed, with that deep and passionate conservatism which, to\nthe very end of his incredible career, gave such an unexpected colouring\nto his inexplicable character, Mr. Gladstone viewed Victoria through a\nhaze of awe which was almost religious--as a sacrosanct embodiment of\nvenerable traditions--a vital element in the British Constitution--a\nQueen by Act of Parliament. But unfortunately the lady did not\nappreciate the compliment. The well-known complaint--\"He speaks to me\nas if I were a public meeting-\" whether authentic or no--and the turn\nof the sentence is surely a little too epigrammatic to be genuinely\nVictorian--undoubtedly expresses the essential element of her antipathy.\nShe had no objection to being considered as an institution; she was one,\nand she knew it. But she was a woman too, and to be considered ONLY as\nan institution--that was unbearable. And thus all Mr. Gladstone's zeal\nand devotion, his ceremonious phrases, his low bows, his punctilious\ncorrectitudes, were utterly wasted; and when, in the excess of his\nloyalty, he went further, and imputed to the object of his veneration,\nwith obsequious blindness, the subtlety of intellect, the wide reading,\nthe grave enthusiasm, which he himself possessed, the misunderstanding\nbecame complete. The discordance between the actual Victoria and this\nstrange Divinity made in Mr. Gladstone's image produced disastrous\nresults. Her discomfort and dislike turned at last into positive\nanimosity, and, though her manners continued to be perfect, she\nnever for a moment unbent; while he on his side was overcome with\ndisappointment, perplexity, and mortification.",

Chartism had been entirely an affair of\nthe lower classes; but now Members of Parliament, learned professors,\nand ladies of title openly avowed the most subversive views.

            "text": "Then there followed six years of excitement, of enchantment, of\nfelicity, of glory, of romance. The amazing being, who now at last, at\nthe age of seventy, after a lifetime of extraordinary struggles, had\nturned into reality the absurdest of his boyhood's dreams, knew well\nenough how to make his own, with absolute completeness, the heart of the\nSovereign Lady whose servant, and whose master, he had so miraculously\nbecome. In women's hearts he had always read as in an open book. His\nwhole career had turned upon those curious entities; and the more\ncurious they were, the more intimately at home with them he seemed\nto be. But Lady Beaconsfield, with her cracked idolatry, and Mrs.\nBrydges-Williams, with her clogs, her corpulence, and her legacy,\nwere gone: an even more remarkable phenomenon stood in their place. He\nsurveyed what was before him with the eye of a past-master; and he was\nnot for a moment at a loss. He realised everything--the interacting\ncomplexities of circumstance and character, the pride of place mingled\nso inextricably with personal arrogance, the superabundant emotionalism,\nthe ingenuousness of outlook, the solid, the laborious respectability,\nshot through so incongruously by temperamental cravings for the\ncoloured and the strange, the singular intellectual limitations, and the\nmysteriously essential female elements impregnating every particle of\nthe whole. A smile hovered over his impassive features, and he\ndubbed Victoria \"the Faery.\" The name delighted him, for, with that\nepigrammatic ambiguity so dear to his heart, it precisely expressed\nhis vision of the Queen. The Spenserian allusion was very pleasant--the\nelegant evocations of Gloriana; but there was more in it than that:\nthere was the suggestion of a diminutive creature, endowed with\nmagical--and mythical--properties, and a portentousness almost\nridiculously out of keeping with the rest of her make-up. The Faery, he\ndetermined, should henceforward wave her wand for him alone. Detachment\nis always a rare quality, and rarest of all, perhaps, among politicians;\nbut that veteran egotist possessed it in a supreme degree. Not only did\nhe know what he had to do, not only did he do it; he was in the audience\nas well as on the stage; and he took in with the rich relish of a\nconnoisseur every feature of the entertaining situation, every phase of\nthe delicate drama, and every detail of his own consummate performance.\nThe smile hovered and vanished, and, bowing low with Oriental gravity\nand Oriental submissiveness, he set himself to his task. He had\nunderstood from the first that in dealing with the Faery the appropriate\nmethod of approach was the very antithesis of the Gladstonian; and such\na method was naturally his. It was not his habit to harangue and exhort\nand expatiate in official conscientiousness; he liked to scatter flowers\nalong the path of business, to compress a weighty argument into a happy\nphrase, to insinuate what was in his mind with an air of friendship\nand confidential courtesy. He was nothing if not personal; and he had\nperceived that personality was the key that opened the Faery's heart.\nAccordingly, he never for a moment allowed his intercourse with her to\nlose the personal tone; he invested all the transactions of State with\nthe charms of familiar conversation; she was always the royal lady, the\nadored and revered mistress, he the devoted and respectful friend. When\nonce the personal relation was firmly established, every difficulty\ndisappeared. But to maintain that relation uninterruptedly in a smooth\nand even course a particular care was necessary: the bearings had to be\nmost assiduously oiled. Nor was Disraeli in any doubt as to the nature\nof the lubricant. \"You have heard me called a flatterer,\" he said to\nMatthew Arnold, \"and it is true. Everyone likes flattery, and when you\ncome to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.\" He practiced what\nhe preached. His adulation was incessant, and he applied it in the very\nthickest slabs. \"There is no honor and no reward,\" he declared, \"that\nwith him can ever equal the possession of your Majesty's kind thoughts.\nAll his own thoughts and feelings and duties and affections are now\nconcentrated in your Majesty, and he desires nothing more for his\nremaining years than to serve your Majesty, or, if that service\nceases, to live still on its memory as a period of his existence most\ninteresting and fascinating.\" \"In life,\" he told her, \"one must have for\none's thoughts a sacred depository, and Lord Beaconsfield ever presumes",

She was, she said,\nmuch grieved by \"the worry and annoyance\" to which he was subjected; she\nfeared she was the cause of it; and she would never forget what she owed\nto \"her kind, good, and considerate friend.\" At the same time, her wrath\nfell on the Opposition.

            "text": "of Victoria's temper occurred in the following year, during the crowning\ncrisis of Beaconsfield's life. His growing imperialism, his desire\nto magnify the power and prestige of England, his insistence upon a\n\"spirited foreign policy,\" had brought him into collision with Russia;\nthe terrible Eastern Question loomed up; and when war broke out between\nRussia and Turkey, the gravity of the situation became extreme.\nThe Prime Minister's policy was fraught with difficulty and danger.\nRealising perfectly the appalling implications of an Anglo-Russian war,\nhe was yet prepared to face even that eventuality if he could obtain\nhis ends by no other method; but he believed that Russia in reality was\nstill less desirous of a rupture, and that, if he played his game with\nsufficient boldness and adroitness, she would yield, when it came to the\npoint, all that he required without a blow. It was clear that the\ncourse he had marked out for himself was full of hazard, and demanded\nan extraordinary nerve; a single false step, and either himself, or\nEngland, might be plunged in disaster. But nerve he had never lacked;\nhe began his diplomatic egg-dance with high assurance; and then he\ndiscovered that, besides the Russian Government, besides the Liberals\nand Mr. Gladstone, there were two additional sources of perilous\nembarrassment with which he would have to reckon. In the first place\nthere was a strong party in the Cabinet, headed by Lord Derby, the\nForeign Secretary, which was unwilling to take the risk of war; but his\nculminating anxiety was the Faery.\nFrom the first, her attitude was uncompromising. The old hatred of\nRussia, which had been engendered by the Crimean War, surged up again\nwithin her; she remembered Albert's prolonged animosity; she felt the\nprickings of her own greatness; and she flung herself into the turmoil\nwith passionate heat. Her indignation with the Opposition--with anyone\nwho ventured to sympathise with the Russians in their quarrel with the\nTurks--was unbounded. When anti-Turkish meetings were held in London,\npresided over by the Duke of Westminster and Lord Shaftesbury, and\nattended by Mr. Gladstone and other prominent Radicals, she considered\nthat \"the Attorney-General ought to be set at these men;\" \"it can't,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"be constitutional.\" Never in her life, not even in the\ncrisis over the Ladies of the Bedchamber, did she show herself a more\nfurious partisan. But her displeasure was not reserved for the Radicals;\nthe backsliding Conservatives equally felt its force. She was even\ndiscontented with Lord Beaconsfield himself. Failing entirely to\nappreciate the delicate complexity of his policy, she constantly\nassailed him with demands for vigorous action, interpreted each finesse\nas a sign of weakness, and was ready at every juncture to let slip the\ndogs of war. As the situation developed, her anxiety grew feverish. \"The\nQueen,\" she wrote, \"is feeling terribly anxious lest delay should cause\nus to be too late and lose our prestige for ever! It worries her night\nand day.\" \"The Faery,\" Beaconsfield told Lady Bradford, \"writes every\nday and telegraphs every hour; this is almost literally the case.\" She\nraged loudly against the Russians. \"And the language,\" she cried,\n\"the insulting language--used by the Russians against us! It makes the\nQueen's blood boil!\" \"Oh,\" she wrote a little later, \"if the Queen were\na man, she would like to go and give those Russians, whose word one\ncannot believe, such a beating! We shall never be friends again till we\nhave it out. This the Queen feels sure of.\"\nThe unfortunate Prime Minister, urged on to violence by Victoria on\none side, had to deal, on the other, with a Foreign Secretary who was\nfundamentally opposed to any policy of active interference at all.\nBetween the Queen and Lord Derby he held a harassed course. He gained,\nindeed, some slight satisfaction in playing on the one against the\nother--in stimulating Lord Derby with the Queen's missives, and in\nappeasing the Queen by repudiating Lord Derby's opinions; on one\noccasion he actually went so far as to compose, at Victoria's request,\na letter bitterly attacking his colleague, which Her Majesty forthwith\nsigned, and sent, without alteration, to the Foreign Secretary. But such\ndevices only gave a temporary relief; and it soon became evident that\nVictoria's martial ardour was not to be sidetracked by hostilities\nagainst Lord Derby; hostilities against Russia were what she wanted,\nwhat she would, what she must, have. For now, casting aside the last\nrelics of moderation, she began to attack her friend with a series of\nextraordinary threats. Not once, not twice, but many times she held over\nhis head the formidable menace of her imminent abdication. \"If England,\"\nshe wrote to Beaconsfield, \"is to kiss Russia's feet, she will not be a\nparty to the humiliation of England and would lay down her crown,\" and\nshe added that the Prime Minister might, if he thought fit, repeat her\nwords to the Cabinet. \"This delay,\" she ejaculated, \"this uncertainty by\nwhich, abroad, we are losing our prestige and our position, while Russia\nis advancing and will be before Constantinople in no time! Then the\nGovernment will be fearfully blamed and the Queen so humiliated that\nshe thinks she would abdicate at once. Be bold!\" \"She feels,\" she\nreiterated, \"she cannot, as she before said, remain the Sovereign of\na country that is letting itself down to kiss the feet of the great\nbarbarians, the retarders of all liberty and civilisation that exists.\"\nWhen the Russians advanced to the outskirts of Constantinople she fired\noff three letters in a day demanding war; and when she learnt that the\nCabinet had only decided to send the Fleet to Gallipoli she declared\nthat \"her first impulse\" was \"to lay down the thorny crown, which she\nfeels little satisfaction in retaining if the position of this country\nis to remain as it is now.\" It is easy to imagine the agitating effect\nof such a correspondence upon Beaconsfield. This was no longer the\nFaery; it was a genie whom he had rashly called out of her bottle, and\nwho was now intent upon showing her supernal power. More than once,\nperplexed, dispirited, shattered by illness, he had thoughts of\nwithdrawing altogether from the game. One thing alone, he told Lady\nBradford, with a wry smile, prevented him. \"If I could only,\" he wrote,\n\"face the scene which would occur at headquarters if I resigned, I would\ndo so at once.\"\nHe held on, however, to emerge victorious at last. The Queen was\npacified; Lord Derby was replaced by Lord Salisbury; and at the Congress\nof Berlin der alte Jude carried all before him. He returned to England\nin triumph, and assured the delighted Victoria that she would very soon\nbe, if she was not already, the \"Dictatress of Europe.\"\nBut soon there was an unexpected reverse.

With the marriages of her elder children her family\ncircle widened; grandchildren appeared; and a multitude of new domestic\ninterests sprang up. The death of King Leopold in 1865 had removed the\npredominant figure of the older generation, and the functions he had\nperformed as the centre and adviser of a large group of relatives in\nGermany and in England devolved upon Victoria. These functions\nshe discharged with unremitting industry, carrying on an enormous\ncorrespondence, and following with absorbed interest every detail in the\nlives of the ever-ramifying cousinhood.

For more and more\ndid she find solace and refreshment in her Highland domain; and twice\nyearly, in the spring and in the autumn, with a sigh of relief, she set\nher face northwards, in spite of the humble protests of Ministers, who\nmurmured vainly in the royal ears that to transact the affairs of State\nover an interval of six hundred miles added considerably to the cares\nof government. Her ladies, too, felt occasionally a slight reluctance to\nset out, for, especially in the early days, the long pilgrimage was not\nwithout its drawbacks. For many years the Queen's conservatism forbade\nthe continuation of the railway up Deeside, so that the last stages\nof the journey had to be accomplished in carriages. But, after all,\ncarriages had their good points; they were easy, for instance, to get\nin and out of, which was an important consideration, for the royal train\nremained for long immune from modern conveniences, and when it drew up,\non some border moorland, far from any platform, the highbred dames were\nobliged to descend to earth by the perilous foot-board, the only pair\nof folding steps being reserved for Her Majesty's saloon. In the days of\ncrinolines such moments were sometimes awkward; and it was occasionally\nnecessary to summon Mr. Johnstone, the short and sturdy Manager of the\nCaledonian Railway, who, more than once, in a high gale and drenching\nrain with great difficulty \"pushed up\"--as he himself described it--some\nunlucky Lady Blanche or Lady Agatha into her compartment. But Victoria\ncared for none of these things. She was only intent upon regaining, with\nthe utmost swiftness, her enchanted Castle, where every spot was charged\nwith memories, where every memory was sacred, and where life was passed\nin an incessant and delightful round of absolutely trivial events.\nAnd it was not only the place that she loved; she was equally attached\nto \"the simple mountaineers,\" from whom, she said, \"she learnt many\na lesson of resignation and faith.\" Smith and Grant and Ross and\nThompson--she was devoted to them all; but, beyond the rest, she was\ndevoted to John Brown. The Prince's gillie had now become the Queen's\npersonal attendant--a body servant from whom she was never parted, who\naccompanied her on her drives, waited on her during the day, and\nslept in a neighbouring chamber at night. She liked his strength, his\nsolidity, the sense he gave her of physical security; she even liked his\nrugged manners and his rough unaccommodating speech. She allowed him to\ntake liberties with her which would have been unthinkable from anybody\nelse. To bully the Queen, to order her about, to reprimand her--who\ncould dream of venturing upon such audacities? And yet, when she\nreceived such treatment from John Brown, she positively seemed to enjoy\nit. The eccentricity appeared to be extraordinary; but, after all, it\nis no uncommon thing for an autocratic dowager to allow some trusted\nindispensable servant to adopt towards her an attitude of authority\nwhich is jealously forbidden to relatives or friends: the power of a\ndependent still remains, by a psychological sleight-of-hand, one's own\npower, even when it is exercised over oneself. When Victoria meekly\nobeyed the abrupt commands of her henchman to get off her pony or put on\nher shawl, was she not displaying, and in the highest degree, the force\nof her volition? People might wonder; she could not help that; this was\nthe manner in which it pleased her to act, and there was an end of it.\nTo have submitted her judgment to a son or a Minister might have seemed\nwiser or more natural; but if she had done so, she instinctively felt,\nshe would indeed have lost her independence. And yet upon somebody\nshe longed to depend. Her days were heavy with the long process of\ndomination. As she drove in silence over the moors she leaned back in\nthe carriage, oppressed and weary; but what a relief--John Brown was\nbehind on the rumble, and his strong arm would be there for her to lean\nupon when she got out.",

In their\nexpeditions the Prince had always trusted him more than anyone; the\ngruff, kind, hairy Scotsman was, she felt, in some mysterious way,\na legacy from the dead. She came to believe at last--or so it\nappeared--that the spirit of Albert was nearer when Brown was near.\nOften, when seeking inspiration over some complicated question of\npolitical or domestic import, she would gaze with deep concentration at\nher late husband's bust. But it was also noticed that sometimes in such\nmoments of doubt and hesitation Her Majesty's looks would fix themselves\nupon John Brown.\nEventually, the \"simple mountaineer\" became almost a state personage.\nThe influence which he wielded was not to be overlooked. Lord\nBeaconsfield was careful, from time to time, to send courteous messages\nto \"Mr. Brown\" in his letters to the Queen, and the French Government\ntook particular pains to provide for his comfort during the visits of\nthe English Sovereign to France. It was only natural that among the\nelder members of the royal family he should not have been popular, and\nthat his failings--for failings he had, though Victoria would never\nnotice his too acute appreciation of Scotch whisky--should have been\nthe subject of acrimonious comment at Court. But he served his mistress\nfaithfully, and to ignore him would be a sign of disrespect to her\nbiographer. For the Queen, far from making a secret of her affectionate\nfriendship, took care to publish it to the world. By her orders two\ngold medals were struck in his honour; on his death, in 1883, a long and\neulogistic obituary notice of him appeared in the Court Circular; and a\nBrown memorial brooch--of gold, with the late gillie's head on one side\nand the royal monogram on the other--was designed by Her Majesty for\npresentation to her Highland servants and cottagers, to be worn by them\non the anniversary of his death, with a mourning scarf and pins. In the\nsecond series of extracts from the Queen's Highland Journal, published\nin 1884, her \"devoted personal attendant and faithful friend\" appears\nupon almost every page, and is in effect the hero of the book. With an\nabsence of reticence remarkable in royal persons, Victoria seemed to\ndemand, in this private and delicate matter, the sympathy of the whole\nnation; and yet--such is the world--there were those who actually\ntreated the relations between their Sovereign and her servant as a theme\nfor ribald jests.",

            "text": "An event which occurred in 1882 revealed and accentuated the feelings of\nthe nation. As the Queen, at Windsor, was walking from the train to her\ncarriage, a youth named Roderick Maclean fired a pistol at her from a\ndistance of a few yards. An Eton boy struck up Maclean's arm with an\numbrella before the pistol went off; no damage was done, and the culprit\nwas at once arrested. This was the last of a series of seven attempts\nupon the Queen--attempts which, taking place at sporadic intervals over\na period of forty years, resembled one another in a curious manner. All,\nwith a single exception, were perpetrated by adolescents, whose motives\nwere apparently not murderous, since, save in the case of Maclean, none\nof their pistols was loaded. These unhappy youths, who, after buying\ntheir cheap weapons, stuffed them with gunpowder and paper, and then\nwent off, with the certainty of immediate detection, to click them in\nthe face of royalty, present a strange problem to the psychologist. But,\nthough in each case their actions and their purposes seemed to be so\nsimilar, their fates were remarkably varied. The first of them, Edward\nOxford, who fired at Victoria within a few months of her marriage, was\ntried for high treason, declared to be insane, and sent to an asylum for\nlife. It appears, however, that this sentence did not commend itself to\nAlbert, for when, two years later, John Francis committed the same of\nfence, and was tried upon the same charge, the Prince propounced that\nthere was no insanity in the matter. \"The wretched creature,\" he told\nhis father, was \"not out of his mind, but a thorough scamp.\" \"I hope,\"\nhe added, \"his trial will be conducted with the greatest strictness.\"\nApparently it was; at any rate, the jury shared the view of the Prince,\nthe plea of insanity was, set aside, and Francis was found guilty of\nhigh treason and condemned to death; but, as there was no proof of\nan intent to kill or even to wound, this sentence, after a lengthened\ndeliberation between the Home Secretary and the Judges, was commuted for\none of transportation for life. As the law stood, these assaults, futile\nas they were, could only be treated as high treason; the discrepancy\nbetween the actual deed and the tremendous penalties involved was\nobviously grotesque; and it was, besides, clear that a jury, knowing\nthat a verdict of guilty implied a sentence of death, would tend to\nthe alternative course, and find the prisoner not guilty but insane--a\nconclusion which, on the face of it, would have appeared to be the more\nreasonable. In 1842, therefore, an Act was passed making any attempt\nto hurt the Queen a misdemeanor, punishable by transportation for seven\nyears, or imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not\nexceeding three years--the misdemeanant, at the discretion of the Court,\n\"to be publicly or privately whipped, as often, and in such manner\nand form, as the Court shall direct, not exceeding thrice.\" The four\nsubsequent attempts were all dealt with under this new law; William\nBean, in 1842, was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment; William\nHamilton, in 1849, was transported for seven years; and, in 1850, the\nsame sentence was passed upon Lieutenant Robert Pate, who struck the\nQueen on the head with his cane in Piccadilly. Pate, alone among these\ndelinquents, was of mature years; he had held a commission in the Army,\ndressed himself as a dandy, and was, the Prince declared, \"manifestly\nderanged.\" In 1872 Arthur O'Connor, a youth of seventeen, fired\nan unloaded pistol at the Queen outside Buckingham Palace; he\nwas immediately seized by John Brown, and sentenced to one year's\nimprisonment and twenty strokes of the birch rod. It was for his bravery\nupon this occasion that Brown was presented with one of his gold medals.\nIn all these cases the jury had refused to allow the plea of insanity;\nbut Roderick Maclean's attempt in 1882 had a different issue. On this\noccasion the pistol was found to have been loaded, and the public\nindignation, emphasised as it was by Victoria's growing popularity,\nwas particularly great. Either for this or for some other reason the\nprocedure of the last forty years was abandoned, and Maclean was tried\nfor high treason. The result was what might have been expected: the jury\nbrought in a verdict of \"not guilty, but insane\"; and the prisoner was\nsent to an asylum during Her Majesty's pleasure. Their verdict, however,",

Victoria, who doubtless carried in\nher mind some memory of Albert's disapproval of a similar verdict in\nthe case of Oxford, was very much annoyed. What did the jury mean, she\nasked, by saying that Maclean was not guilty? It was perfectly clear\nthat he was guilty--she had seen him fire off the pistol herself. It was\nin vain that Her Majesty's constitutional advisers reminded her of the\nprinciple of English law which lays down that no man can be found\nguilty of a crime unless he be proved to have had a criminal intention.\nVictoria was quite unconvinced. \"If that is the law,\" she said, \"the law\nmust be altered:\" and altered it was. In 1883 an Act was passed changing\nthe form of the verdict in cases of insanity, and the confusing anomaly\nremains upon the Statute Book to this day.\nBut it was not only through the feelings--commiserating or indignant--of\npersonal sympathy that the Queen and her people were being drawn more\nnearly together; they were beginning, at last, to come to a close and\npermanent agreement upon the conduct of public affairs. Mr. Gladstone's\nsecond administration (1880-85) was a succession of failures, ending in\ndisaster and disgrace; liberalism fell into discredit with the country,\nand Victoria perceived with joy that her distrust of her Ministers was\nshared by an ever-increasing number of her subjects. During the crisis\nin the Sudan, the popular temper was her own. She had been among the\nfirst to urge the necessity of an expedition to Khartoum, and, when the\nnews came of the catastrophic death of General Gordon, her voice led the\nchorus of denunciation which raved against the Government. In her rage,\nshe despatched a fulminating telegram to Mr. Gladstone, not in the usual\ncypher, but open; and her letter of condolence to Miss Gordon, in which\nshe attacked her Ministers for breach of faith, was widely published.\nIt was rumoured that she had sent for Lord Hartington, the Secretary\nof State for War, and vehemently upbraided him. \"She rated me,\" he was\nreported to have told a friend, \"as if I'd been a footman.\" \"Why didn't\nshe send for the butler?\" asked his friend. \"Oh,\" was the reply, \"the\nbutler generally manages to keep out of the way on such occasions.\"\nBut the day came when it was impossible to keep out of the way any\nlonger. Mr. Gladstone was defeated, and resigned. Victoria, at a\nfinal interview, received him with her usual amenity, but, besides the\nformalities demanded by the occasion, the only remark which she made\nto him of a personal nature was to the effect that she supposed Mr.\nGladstone would now require some rest. He remembered with regret how,\nat a similar audience in 1874, she had expressed her trust in him as a\nsupporter of the throne; but he noted the change without surprise. \"Her\nmind and opinions,\" he wrote in his diary afterwards, \"have since that\nday been seriously warped.\"\nSuch was Mr. Gladstone's view,; but the majority of the nation by no\nmeans agreed with him; and, in the General Election of 1886, they\nshowed decisively that Victoria's politics were identical with theirs\nby casting forth the contrivers of Home Rule--that abomination of\ndesolation--into outer darkness, and placing Lord Salisbury in",

Her habit of life was suddenly altered; abandoning\nthe long seclusion which Disraeli's persuasions had only momentarily\ninterrupted, she threw herself vigorously into a multitude of public\nactivities. She appeared at drawing-rooms, at concerts, at reviews; she\nlaid foundation-stones; she went to Liverpool to open an international\nexhibition, driving through the streets in her open carriage in heavy\nrain amid vast applauding crowds. Delighted by the welcome which met\nher everywhere, she warmed to her work. She visited Edinburgh, where the\novation of Liverpool was repeated and surpassed. In London, she opened\nin high state the Colonial and Indian Exhibition at South Kensington.\nOn this occasion the ceremonial was particularly magnificent; a blare\nof trumpets announced the approach of Her Majesty; the \"Natiohal Anthem\"\nfollowed; and the Queen, seated on a gorgeous throne of hammered gold,\nreplied with her own lips to the address that was presented to her. Then\nshe rose, and, advancing upon the platform with regal port, acknowledged\nthe acclamations of the great assembly by a succession of curtseys, of\nelaborate and commanding grace.\nNext year was the fiftieth of her reign, and in June the splendid\nanniversary was celebrated in solemn pomp. Victoria, surrounded by the\nhighest dignitaries of her realm, escorted by a glittering galaxy of\nkings and princes, drove through the crowded enthusiasm of the capital\nto render thanks to God in Westminster Abbey. In that triumphant hour\nthe last remaining traces of past antipathies and past disagreements\nwere altogether swept away. The Queen was hailed at once as the mother\nof her people and as the embodied symbol of their imperial greatness;\nand she responded to the double sentiment with all the ardour of her\nspirit. England and the people of England, she knew it, she felt it,\nwere, in some wonderful and yet quite simple manner, hers. Exultation,\naffection, gratitude, a profound sense of obligation, an unbounded\npride--such were her emotions; and, colouring and intensifying the\nrest, there was something else. At last, after so long,\nhappiness--fragmentary, perhaps, and charged with gravity, but true\nand unmistakable none the less--had returned to her. The unaccustomed\nfeeling filled and warmed her consciousness.

For an\nunexampled atmosphere of success and adoration invested the last period\nof Victoria's life. Her triumph was the summary, the crown, of a greater\ntriumph--the culminating prosperity of a nation. The solid splendour of\nthe decade between Victoria's two jubilees can hardly be paralleled in\nthe annals of England. The sage counsels of Lord Salisbury seemed to\nbring with them not only wealth and power, but security; and the country\nsettled down, with calm assurance, to the enjoyment of an established\ngrandeur. And--it was only natural--Victoria settled down too. For\nshe was a part of the establishment--an essential part as it seemed--a\nfixture--a magnificent, immovable sideboard in the huge saloon of\nstate. Without her the heaped-up banquet of 1890 would have lost\nits distinctive quality--the comfortable order of the substantial\nunambiguous dishes, with their background of weighty glamour, half out\nof sight.\nHer own existence came to harmonise more and more with what was around\nher. Gradually, imperceptibly, Albert receded. It was not that he was\nforgotten--that would have been impossible--but that the void created\nby his absence grew less agonising, and even, at last, less obvious.\nAt last Victoria found it possible to regret the bad weather without\nimmediately reflecting that her \"dear Albert always said we could not\nalter it, but must leave it as it was;\" she could even enjoy a good\nbreakfast without considering how \"dear Albert\" would have liked the\nbuttered eggs. And, as that figure slowly faded, its place was taken,\ninevitably, by Victoria's own. Her being, revolving for so many years\nround an external object, now changed its motion and found its centre\nin itself. It had to be so: her domestic position, the pressure of\nher public work, her indomitable sense of duty, made anything else\nimpossible. Her egotism proclaimed its rights. Her age increased still\nfurther the surrounding deference; and her force of character, emerging\nat length in all its plenitude, imposed absolutely upon its environment\nby the conscious effort of an imperious will.\nLittle by little it was noticed that the outward vestiges of Albert's\nposthumous domination grew less complete. At Court the stringency of\nmourning was relaxed. As the Queen drove through the Park in her open\ncarriage with her Highlanders behind her, nursery-maids canvassed\neagerly the growing patch of violet velvet in the bonnet with its jet\nappurtenances on the small bowing head.\nIt was in her family that Victoria's ascendancy reached its highest\npoint. All her offspring were married; the number of her descendants\nrapidly increased; there were many marriages in the third generation;\nand no fewer than thirty-seven of her great-grandchildren were living at\nthe time of her death. A picture of the period displays the royal family\ncollected together in one of the great rooms at Windsor--a crowded\ncompany of more than fifty persons, with the imperial matriarch in\ntheir midst. Over them all she ruled with a most potent sway. The small\nconcerns of the youngest aroused her passionate interest; and the oldest\nshe treated as if they were children still. The Prince of Wales, in\nparticular, stood in tremendous awe of his mother. She had steadily\nrefused to allow him the slightest participation in the business of\ngovernment; and he had occupied himself in other ways. Nor could it\nbe denied that he enjoyed himself--out of her sight; but, in that\nredoubtable presence, his abounding manhood suffered a miserable\neclipse. Once, at Osborne, when, owing to no fault of his, he was too\nlate for a dinner party, he was observed standing behind a pillar and\nwiping the sweat from his forehead, trying to nerve himself to go up to\nthe Queen. When at last he did so, she gave him a stiff nod, whereupon\nhe vanished immediately behind another pillar, and remained there until\nthe party broke up. At the time of this incident the Prince of Wales was",

The Crown Prince held liberal\nopinions; he was much influenced by his wife; and both were detested by\nBismarck, who declared with scurrilous emphasis that the Englishwoman\nand her mother were a menace to the Prussian State. The feud was still\nfurther intensified when, on the death of the old Emperor (1888), the\nCrown Prince succeeded to the throne. A family entanglement brought on\na violent crisis. One of the daughters of the new Empress had become\nbetrothed to Prince Alexander of Battenberg, who had lately been\nejected from the throne of Bulgaria owing to the hostility of the Tsar.\nVictoria, as well as the Empress, highly approved of the match. Of the\ntwo brothers of Prince Alexander, the elder had married another of her\ngrand-daughters, and the younger was the husband of her daughter, the\nPrincess Beatrice; she was devoted to the handsome young man; and she\nwas delighted by the prospect of the third brother--on the whole the\nhandsomest, she thought, of the three--also becoming a member of her\nfamily. Unfortunately, however, Bismarck was opposed to the scheme.\nHe perceived that the marriage would endanger the friendship between\nGermany and Russia, which was vital to his foreign policy, and he\nannounced that it must not take place. A fierce struggle between the\nEmpress and the Chancellor followed. Victoria, whose hatred of her\ndaughter's enemy was unbounded, came over to Charlottenburg to join in\nthe fray. Bismarck, over his pipe and lager, snorted out his alarm. The\nQueen of England's object, he said, was clearly political--she wished to\nestrange Germany and Russia--and very likely she would have her way. \"In\nfamily matters,\" he added, \"she is not used to contradiction;\" she would\n\"bring the parson with her in her travelling bag and the bridegroom in\nher trunk, and the marriage would come off on the spot.\" But the man\nof blood and iron was not to be thwarted so easily, and he asked for a\nprivate interview with the Queen. The details of their conversation are\nunknown; but it is certain that in the course of it Victoria was forced\nto realise the meaning of resistance to that formidable personage, and\nthat she promised to use all her influence to prevent the marriage. The\nengagement was broken off; and in the following year Prince Alexander of\nBattenberg united himself to Fraulein Loisinger, an actress at the court\ntheatre of Darmstad.",

            "text": "than before. Her life passed in an extraordinary exactitude. Every\nmoment of her day was mapped out beforehand; the succession of her\nengagements was immutably fixed; the dates of her journeys--to Osborne,\nto Balmoral, to the South of France, to Windsor, to London--were hardly\naltered from year to year. She demanded from those who surrounded her\na rigid precision in details, and she was preternaturally quick in\ndetecting the slightest deviation from the rules which she had laid\ndown. Such was the irresistible potency of her personality, that\nanything but the most implicit obedience to her wishes was felt to be\nimpossible; but sometimes somebody was unpunctual; and unpunctuality\nwas one of the most heinous of sins. Then her displeasure--her dreadful\ndispleasure--became all too visible. At such moments there seemed\nnothing surprising in her having been the daughter of a martinet.\nBut these storms, unnerving as they were while they lasted, were quickly\nover, and they grew more and more exceptional. With the return of\nhappiness a gentle benignity flowed from the aged Queen. Her smile, once\nso rare a visitant to those saddened features, flitted over them with an\neasy alacrity; the blue eyes beamed; the whole face, starting suddenly\nfrom its pendulous expressionlessness, brightened and softened and cast\nover those who watched it an unforgettable charm. For in her last years\nthere was a fascination in Victoria's amiability which had been lacking\neven from the vivid impulse of her youth. Over all who approached\nher--or very nearly all--she threw a peculiar spell. Her grandchildren\nadored her; her ladies waited upon her with a reverential love. The\nhonour of serving her obliterated a thousand inconveniences--the\nmonotony of a court existence, the fatigue of standing, the necessity\nfor a superhuman attentiveness to the minutia: of time and space. As one\ndid one's wonderful duty one could forget that one's legs were aching\nfrom the infinitude of the passages at Windsor, or that one's bare arms\nwere turning blue in the Balmoral cold.\nWhat, above all, seemed to make such service delightful was the detailed\ninterest which the Queen took in the circumstances of those around\nher. Her absorbing passion for the comfortable commonplaces, the small\ncrises, the recurrent sentimentalities, of domestic life constantly\ndemanded wider fields for its activity; the sphere of her own family,\nvast as it was, was not enough; she became the eager confidante of\nthe household affairs of her ladies; her sympathies reached out to\nthe palace domestics; even the housemaids and scullions--so it\nappeared--were the objects of her searching inquiries, and of her\nheartfelt solicitude when their lovers were ordered to a foreign\nstation, or their aunts suffered from an attack of rheumatism which was\nmore than usually acute.\nNevertheless the due distinctions of rank were immaculately preserved.\nThe Queen's mere presence was enough to ensure that; but, in addition,\nthe dominion of court etiquette was paramount. For that elaborate code,\nwhich had kept Lord Melbourne stiff upon the sofa and ranged the other\nguests in silence about the round table according to the order of\nprecedence, was as punctiliously enforced as ever. Every evening after\ndinner, the hearth-rug, sacred to royalty, loomed before the profane in\ninaccessible glory, or, on one or two terrific occasions, actually lured\nthem magnetically forward to the very edge of the abyss. The Queen, at\nthe fitting moment, moved towards her guests; one after the other they\nwere led up to her; and, while dialogue followed dialogue in constraint\nand embarrassment, the rest of the assembly stood still, without a word.\nOnly in one particular was the severity of the etiquette allowed to\nlapse. Throughout the greater part of the reign the rule that ministers\nmust stand during their audiences with the Queen had been absolute. When\nLord Derby, the Prime Minister, had an audience of Her Majesty after\na serious illness, he mentioned it afterwards, as a proof of the royal\nfavour, that the Queen had remarked \"How sorry she was she could not ask\nhim to be seated.\" Subsequently, Disraeli, after an attack of gout\nand in a moment of extreme expansion on the part of Victoria, had\nbeen offered a chair; but he had thought it wise humbly to decline the\nprivilege. In her later years, however, the Queen invariably asked Mr.\nGladstone and Lord Salisbury to sit down.\nSometimes the solemnity of the evening was diversified by a concert, an\nopera, or even a play. One of the most marked indications of\nVictoria's enfranchisement from the thraldom of widowhood had been\nher resumption--after an interval of thirty years--of the custom of\ncommanding dramatic companies from London to perform before the Court at\nWindsor. On such occasions her spirits rose high. She loved acting; she\nloved a good plot; above all, she loved a farce. Engrossed by everything\nthat passed upon the stage she would follow, with childlike innocence,\nthe unwinding of the story; or she would assume an air of knowing\nsuperiority and exclaim in triumph, \"There! You didn't expect that, did\nyou?\" when the denouement came. Her sense of humour was of a vigorous\nthough primitive kind. She had been one of the very few persons who had\nalways been able to appreciate the Prince Consort's jokes; and, when\nthose were cracked no more, she could still roar with laughter, in the\nprivacy of her household, over some small piece of fun--some oddity of\nan ambassador, or some ignorant Minister's faux pas. When the jest grew\nsubtle she was less pleased; but, if it approached the confines of the\nindecorous, the danger was serious. To take a liberty called down at\nonce Her Majesty's most crushing disapprobation; and to say something\nimproper was to take the greatest liberty of all. Then the royal\nlips sank down at the corners, the royal eyes stared in astonished\nprotrusion, and in fact, the royal countenance became inauspicious in\nthe highest degree. The transgressor shuddered into silence, while the\nawful \"We are not amused\" annihilated the dinner table. Afterwards,\nin her private entourage, the Queen would observe that the person in\nquestion was, she very much feared, \"not discreet\"; it was a verdict\nfrom which there was no appeal.\nIn general, her aesthetic tastes had remained unchanged since the days\nof Mendelssohn, Landseer, and Lablache. She still delighted in the\nroulades of Italian opera; she still demanded a high standard in the\nexecution of a pianoforte duet. Her views on painting were decided;\nSir Edwin, she declared, was perfect; she was much impressed by Lord\nLeighton's manners; and she profoundly distrusted Mr. Watts. From time\nto time she ordered engraved portraits to be taken of members of\nthe royal family; on these occasions she would have the first proofs\nsubmitted to her, and, having inspected them with minute particularity,\nshe would point out their mistakes to the artists, indicating at the\nsame time how they might be corrected. The artists invariably discovered\nthat Her Majesty's suggestions were of the highest value. In literature\nher interests were more restricted. She was devoted to Lord Tennyson;\nand, as the Prince Consort had admired George Eliot, she perused\n\"Middlemarch:\" she was disappointed. There is reason to believe,\nhowever, that the romances of another female writer, whose popularity\namong the humbler classes of Her Majesty's subjects was at one time\nenormous, secured, no less, the approval of Her Majesty. Otherwise she\ndid not read very much.\nOnce, however, the Queen's attention was drawn to a publication which it\nwas impossible for her to ignore. \"The Greville Memoirs,\" filled with a\nmass of historical information of extraordinary importance, but filled\nalso with descriptions, which were by no means flattering, of George\nIV, William IV, and other royal persons, was brought out by Mr. Reeve.\nVictoria read the book, and was appalled. It was, she declared, a\n\"dreadful and really scandalous book,\" and she could not say \"how\nHORRIFIED and INDIGNANT\" she was at Greville's \"indiscretion,\nindelicacy, ingratitude towards friends, betrayal of confidence and\nshameful disloyalty towards his Sovereign.\" She wrote to Disraeli to\ntell him that in her opinion it was \"VERY IMPORTANT that the book should\nbe severely censured and discredited.\" \"The tone in which he speaks of\nroyalty,\" she added, \"is unlike anything one sees in history even,\nand is most reprehensible.\" Her anger was directed with almost equal\nvehemence against Mr. Reeve for his having published \"such an abominable\nbook,\" and she charged Sir Arthur Helps to convey to him her deep\ndispleasure. Mr. Reeve, however, was impenitent. When Sir Arthur told\nhim that, in the Queen's opinion, \"the book degraded royalty,\" he\nreplied: \"Not at all; it elevates it by the contrast it offers between\nthe present and the defunct state of affairs.\" But this adroit defence\nfailed to make any impression upon Victoria; and Mr. Reeve, when he\nretired from the public service, did not receive the knighthood which\ncustom entitled him to expect. Perhaps if the Queen had known how many\ncaustic comments upon herself Mr. Reeve had quietly suppressed in the\npublished Memoirs, she would have been almost grateful to him; but, in\nthat case, what would she have said of Greville? Imagination boggles at\nthe thought. As for more modern essays upon the same topic, Her Majesty,\nit is to be feared, would have characterised them as \"not discreet.\"\nBut as a rule the leisure hours of that active life were occupied with\nrecreations of a less intangible quality than the study of literature or\nthe appreciation of art. Victoria was a woman not only of vast property\nbut of innumerable possessions. She had inherited an immense quantity\nof furniture, of ornaments, of china, of plate, of valuable objects of\nevery kind; her purchases, throughout a long life, made a formidable\naddition to these stores; and there flowed in upon her, besides, from\nevery quarter of the globe, a constant stream of gifts. Over this\nenormous mass she exercised an unceasing and minute supervision, and the\narrangement and the contemplation of it, in all its details, filled her\nwith an intimate satisfaction. The collecting instinct has its roots in\nthe very depths of human nature; and, in the case of Victoria, it seemed\nto owe its force to two of her dominating impulses--the intense sense,\nwhich had always been hers, of her own personality, and the craving\nwhich, growing with the years, had become in her old age almost an\nobsession, for fixity, for solidity, for the setting up of palpable\nbarriers against the outrages of change and time. When she considered\nthe multitudinous objects which belonged to her, or, better still, when,\nchoosing out some section of them as the fancy took her, she actually\nsavoured the vivid richness of their individual qualities, she saw\nherself deliciously reflected from a million facets, felt herself\nmagnified miraculously over a boundless area, and was well pleased.\nThat was just as it should be; but then came the dismaying\nthought--everything slips away, crumbles, vanishes; Sevres\ndinner-services get broken; even golden basins go unaccountably astray;\neven one's self, with all the recollections and experiences that make\nup one's being, fluctuates, perishes, dissolves... But no! It could\nnot, should not be so! There should be no changes and no losses! Nothing\nshould ever move--neither the past nor the present--and she herself\nleast of all! And so the tenacious woman, hoarding her valuables,\ndecreed their immortality with all the resolution of her soul. She would\nnot lose one memory or one pin.\nShe gave orders that nothing should be thrown away--and nothing was.",

            "text": "There, in drawer after drawer, in wardrobe after wardrobe, reposed the\ndresses of seventy years. But not only the dresses--the furs and the\nmantles and subsidiary frills and the muffs and the parasols and the\nbonnets--all were ranged in chronological order, dated and complete. A\ngreat cupboard was devoted to the dolls; in the china room at Windsor a\nspecial table held the mugs of her childhood, and her children's mugs as\nwell. Mementoes of the past surrounded her in serried accumulations.\nIn every room the tables were powdered thick with the photographs of\nrelatives; their portraits, revealing them at all ages, covered the\nwalls; their figures, in solid marble, rose up from pedestals, or\ngleamed from brackets in the form of gold and silver statuettes. The\ndead, in every shape--in miniatures, in porcelain, in enormous life-size\noil-paintings--were perpetually about her. John Brown stood upon her\nwriting-table in solid gold. Her favourite horses and dogs, endowed with\na new durability, crowded round her footsteps. Sharp, in silver gilt,\ndominated the dinner table; Boy and Boz lay together among unfading\nflowers, in bronze. And it was not enough that each particle of the\npast should be given the stability of metal or of marble: the whole\ncollection, in its arrangement, no less than its entity, should be\nimmutably fixed. There might be additions, but there might never be\nalterations. No chintz might change, no carpet, no curtain, be replaced\nby another; or, if long use at last made it necessary, the stuffs and\nthe patterns must be so identically reproduced that the keenest eye\nmight not detect the difference. No new picture could be hung upon the\nwalls at Windsor, for those already there had been put in their places\nby Albert, whose decisions were eternal. So, indeed, were Victoria's.\nTo ensure that they should be the aid of the camera was called in. Every\nsingle article in the Queen's possession was photographed from several\npoints of view. These photographs were submitted to Her Majesty, and\nwhen, after careful inspection, she had approved of them, they were\nplaced in a series of albums, richly bound. Then, opposite each\nphotograph, an entry was made, indicating the number of the article, the\nnumber of the room in which it was kept, its exact position in the room\nand all its principal characteristics. The fate of every object which\nhad undergone this process was henceforth irrevocably sealed. The\nwhole multitude, once and for all, took up its steadfast station. And\nVictoria, with a gigantic volume or two of the endless catalogue always\nbeside her, to look through, to ponder upon, to expatiate over, could\nfeel, with a double contentment, that the transitoriness of this world\nhad been arrested by the amplitude of her might.\nThus the collection, ever multiplying, ever encroaching upon new fields\nof consciousness, ever rooting itself more firmly in the depths of\ninstinct, became one of the dominating influences of that strange\nexistence. It was a collection not merely of things and of thoughts,\nbut of states of mind and ways of living as well. The celebration of\nanniversaries grew to be an important branch of it--of birthdays and\nmarriage days and death days, each of which demanded its appropriate\nfeeling, which, in its turn, must be itself expressed in an appropriate\noutward form. And the form, of course--the ceremony of rejoicing\nor lamentation--was stereotyped with the rest: it was part of the\ncollection. On a certain day, for instance, flowers must be strewn on\nJohn Brown's monument at Balmoral; and the date of the yearly departure\nfor Scotland was fixed by that fact. Inevitably it was around the\ncentral circumstance of death--death, the final witness to human\nmutability--that these commemorative cravings clustered most thickly.\nMight not even death itself be humbled, if one could recall enough--if\none asserted, with a sufficiently passionate and reiterated emphasis,\nthe eternity of love? Accordingly, every bed in which Victoria slept had\nattached to it, at the back, on the right-hand side, above the pillow,\na photograph of the head and shoulders of Albert as he lay dead,\nsurmounted by a wreath of immortelles. At Balmoral, where memories came\ncrowding so closely, the solid signs of memory appeared in surprising\nprofusion. Obelisks, pyramids, tombs, statues, cairns, and seats of\ninscribed granite, proclaimed Victoria's dedication to the dead. There,\ntwice a year, on the days that followed her arrival, a solemn\npilgrimage of inspection and meditation was performed. There, on August\n26--Albert's birthday--at the foot of the bronze statue of him in\nHighland dress, the Queen, her family, her Court, her servants, and her\ntenantry, met together and in silence drank to the memory of the dead.\nIn England the tokens of remembrance pullulated hardly less. Not a\nday passed without some addition to the multifold assemblage--a gold\nstatuette of Ross, the piper--a life-sized marble group of Victoria and\nAlbert, in medieval costume, inscribed upon the base with the words:\n\"Allured to brighter worlds and led the way-\" a granite slab in the\nshrubbery at Osborne, informing the visitor of \"Waldmann: the very\nfavourite little dachshund of Queen Victoria; who brought him from\nBaden, April 1872; died, July 11, 1881.\"\nAt Frogmore, the great mausoleum, perpetually enriched, was visited\nalmost daily by the Queen when the Court was at Windsor. But there was\nanother, a more secret and a hardly less holy shrine. The suite of rooms\nwhich Albert had occupied in the Castle was kept for ever shut away\nfrom the eyes of any save the most privileged. Within those precincts\neverything remained as it had been at the Prince's death; but the\nmysterious preoccupation of Victoria had commanded that her husband's\nclothing should be laid afresh, each evening, upon the bed, and that,\neach evening, the water should be set ready in the basin, as if he were\nstill alive; and this incredible rite was performed with scrupulous\nregularity for nearly forty years.",

            "text": "Such was the inner worship; and still the flesh obeyed the spirit; still\nthe daily hours of labour proclaimed Victoria's consecration to duty\nand to the ideal of the dead. Yet, with the years, the sense of\nself-sacrifice faded; the natural energies of that ardent being\ndischarged themselves with satisfaction into the channel of public work;\nthe love of business which, from her girlhood, had been strong within\nher, reasserted itself in all its vigour, and, in her old age, to\nhave been cut off from her papers and her boxes would have been, not a\nrelief, but an agony to Victoria. Thus, though toiling Ministers might\nsigh and suffer, the whole process of government continued, till the\nvery end, to pass before her. Nor was that all; ancient precedent\nhad made the validity of an enormous number of official transactions\ndependent upon the application of the royal sign-manual; and a great\nproportion of the Queen's working hours was spent in this mechanical\ntask. Nor did she show any desire to diminish it. On the contrary, she\nvoluntarily resumed the duty of signing commissions in the army, from\nwhich she had been set free by Act of Parliament, and from which,\nduring the years of middle life, she had abstained. In no case would she\ncountenance the proposal that she should use a stamp. But, at last, when\nthe increasing pressure of business made the delays of the antiquated\nsystem intolerable, she consented that, for certain classes of\ndocuments, her oral sanction should be sufficient. Each paper was read\naloud to her, and she said at the end \"Approved.\" Often, for hours at a\ntime, she would sit, with Albert's bust in front of her, while the word\n\"Approved\" issued at intervals from her lips. The word came forth with\na majestic sonority; for her voice now--how changed from the silvery\ntreble of her girlhood--was a contralto, full and strong.\nIV\nThe final years were years of apotheosis. In the dazzled imagination\nof her subjects Victoria soared aloft towards the regions of divinity\nthrough a nimbus of purest glory. Criticism fell dumb; deficiencies\nwhich, twenty years earlier, would have been universally admitted, were\nnow as universally ignored. That the nation's idol was a very incomplete\nrepresentative of the nation was a circumstance that was hardly noticed,\nand yet it was conspicuously true. For the vast changes which, out of\nthe England of 1837, had produced the England of 1897, seemed scarcely\nto have touched the Queen. The immense industrial development of the\nperiod, the significance of which had been so thoroughly understood\nby Albert, meant little indeed to Victoria. The amazing scientific\nmovement, which Albert had appreciated no less, left Victoria perfectly\ncold. Her conception of the universe, and of man's place in it, and of\nthe stupendous problems of nature and philosophy remained, throughout\nher life, entirely unchanged. Her religion was the religion which she\nhad learnt from the Baroness Lehzen and the Duchess of Kent. Here, too,\nit might have been supposed that Albert's views might have influenced\nher. For Albert, in matters of religion, was advanced. Disbelieving\naltogether in evil spirits, he had had his doubts about the miracle\nof the Gaderene Swine. Stockmar, even, had thrown out, in a remarkable\nmemorandum on the education of the Prince of Wales, the suggestion that\nwhile the child \"must unquestionably be brought up in the creed of the\nChurch of England,\" it might nevertheless be in accordance with\nthe spirit of the times to exclude from his religious training the\ninculcation of a belief in \"the supernatural doctrines of Christianity.\"\nThis, however, would have been going too far; and all the royal children\nwere brought up in complete orthodoxy. Anything else would have grieved\nVictoria, though her own conceptions of the orthodox were not very\nprecise. But her nature, in which imagination and subtlety held so small\na place, made her instinctively recoil from the intricate ecstasies\nof High Anglicanism; and she seemed to feel most at home in the simple\nfaith of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. This was what might have\nbeen expected; for Lehzen was the daughter of a Lutheran pastor, and the\nLutherans and the Presbyterians have much in common. For many years Dr.\nNorman Macleod, an innocent Scotch minister, was her principal spiritual\nadviser; and, when he was taken from her, she drew much comfort from\nquiet chats about life and death with the cottagers at Balmoral.\nHer piety, absolutely genuine, found what it wanted in the sober\nexhortations of old John Grant and the devout saws of Mrs. P.\nFarquharson. They possessed the qualities, which, as a child of\nfourteen, she had so sincerely admired in the Bishop of Chester's\n\"Exposition of the Gospel of St. Matthew;\" they were \"just plain and\ncomprehensible and full of truth and good feeling.\" The Queen, who gave\nher name to the Age of Mill and of Darwin, never got any further than\nthat.\nFrom the social movements of her time Victoria was equally remote.\nTowards the smallest no less than towards the greatest changes she\nremained inflexible. During her youth and middle age smoking had been\nforbidden in polite society, and so long as she lived she would not\nwithdraw her anathema against it. Kings might protest; bishops and\nambassadors, invited to Windsor, might be reduced, in the privacy of\ntheir bedrooms, to lie full-length upon the floor and smoke up the\nchimney--the interdict continued! It might have been supposed that a\nfemale sovereign would have lent her countenance to one of the most\nvital of all the reforms to which her epoch gave birth--the emancipation\nof women--but, on the contrary, the mere mention of such a proposal sent\nthe blood rushing to her head. In 1870, her eye having fallen upon the\nreport of a meeting in favour of Women's Suffrage, she wrote to Mr.\nMartin in royal rage--\"The Queen is most anxious to enlist everyone\nwho can speak or write to join in checking this mad, wicked folly of\n'Woman's Rights,' with all its attendant horrors, on which her poor\nfeeble sex is bent, forgetting every sense of womanly feeling and\npropriety. Lady--ought to get a GOOD WHIPPING. It is a subject which\nmakes the Queen so furious that she cannot contain herself. God\ncreated men and women different--then let them remain each in their own\nposition. Tennyson has some beautiful lines on the difference of men and\nwomen in 'The Princess.' Woman would become the most hateful, heartless,\nand disgusting of human beings were she allowed to unsex herself; and\nwhere would be the protection which man was intended to give the weaker\nsex? The Queen is sure that Mrs. Martin agrees with her.\" The argument\nwas irrefutable; Mrs. Martin agreed; and yet the canker spread.\nIn another direction Victoria's comprehension of the spirit of her age\nhas been constantly asserted. It was for long the custom for courtly\nhistorians and polite politicians to compliment the Queen upon the\ncorrectness of her attitude towards the Constitution. But such praises\nseem hardly to be justified by the facts. In her later years Victoria\nmore than once alluded with regret to her conduct during the Bedchamber\ncrisis, and let it be understood that she had grown wiser since. Yet\nin truth it is difficult to trace any fundamental change either in her\ntheory or her practice in constitutional matters throughout her life.\nThe same despotic and personal spirit which led her to break off the\nnegotiations with Peel is equally visible in her animosity towards\nPalmerston, in her threats of abdication to Disraeli, and in her desire\nto prosecute the Duke of Westminster for attending a meeting upon\nBulgarian atrocities. The complex and delicate principles of the\nConstitution cannot be said to have come within the compass of her\nmental faculties; and in the actual developments which it underwent\nduring her reign she played a passive part. From 1840 to 1861 the\npower of the Crown steadily increased in England; from 1861 to 1901 it\nsteadily declined. The first process was due to the influence of the\nPrince Consort, the second to that of a series of great Ministers.\nDuring the first Victoria was in effect a mere accessory; during the\nsecond the threads of power, which Albert had so laboriously collected,\ninevitably fell from her hands into the vigorous grasp of Mr. Gladstone,\nLord Beaconsfield, and Lord Salisbury. Perhaps, absorbed as she was in\nroutine, and difficult as she found it to distinguish at all clearly\nbetween the trivial and the essential, she was only dimly aware of what\nwas happening. Yet, at the end of her reign, the Crown was weaker than\nat any other time in English history. Paradoxically enough, Victoria\nreceived the highest eulogiums for assenting to a political evolution,\nwhich, had she completely realised its import, would have filled her\nwith supreme displeasure.\nNevertheless it must not be supposed that she was a second George III.\nHer desire to impose her will, vehement as it was, and unlimited by any\nprinciple, was yet checked by a certain shrewdness. She might oppose\nher Ministers with extraordinary violence, she might remain utterly\nimpervious to arguments and supplications; the pertinacity of her\nresolution might seem to be unconquerable; but, at the very last moment\nof all, her obstinacy would give way. Her innate respect and capacity\nfor business, and perhaps, too, the memory of Albert's scrupulous\navoidance of extreme courses, prevented her from ever entering an\nimpasse. By instinct she understood when the facts were too much for\nher, and to them she invariably yielded. After all, what else could she\ndo?\nBut if, in all these ways, the Queen and her epoch were profoundly\nseparated, the points of contact between them also were not few.\nVictoria understood very well the meaning and the attractions of power\nand property, and in such learning the English nation, too, had grown\nto be more and more proficient. During the last fifteen years of the\nreign--for the short Liberal Administration of 1892 was a mere interlude\nimperialism was the dominant creed of the country. It was Victoria's\nas well. In this direction, if in no other, she had allowed her mind to\ndevelop. Under Disraeli's tutelage the British Dominions over the seas\nhad come to mean much more to her than ever before, and, in particular,\nshe had grown enamoured of the East. The thought of India fascinated\nher; she set to, and learnt a little Hindustani; she engaged some Indian\nservants, who became her inseparable attendants, and one of whom, Munshi\nAbdul Karim, eventually almost succeeded to the position which had\nonce been John Brown's. At the same time, the imperialist temper of the\nnation invested her office with a new significance exactly harmonising\nwith her own inmost proclivities. The English polity was in the main\na common-sense structure, but there was always a corner in it where\ncommon-sense could not enter--where, somehow or other, the ordinary\nmeasurements were not applicable and the ordinary rules did not apply.\nSo our ancestors had laid it down, giving scope, in their wisdom, to\nthat mystical element which, as it seems, can never quite be eradicated\nfrom the affairs of men. Naturally it was in the Crown that the\nmysticism of the English polity was concentrated--the Crown, with its\nvenerable antiquity, its sacred associations, its imposing spectacular\narray. But, for nearly two centuries, common-sense had been predominant\nin the great building, and the little, unexplored, inexplicable corner\nhad attracted small attention. Then, with the rise of imperialism, there\nwas a change. For imperialism is a faith as well as a business; as\nit grew, the mysticism in English public life grew with it; and\nsimultaneously a new importance began to attach to the Crown. The\nneed for a symbol--a symbol of England's might, of England's worth,\nof England's extraordinary and mysterious destiny--became felt more\nurgently than ever before. The Crown was that symbol: and the Crown\nrested upon the head of Victoria. Thus it happened that while by the end\nof the reign the power of the sovereign had appreciably diminished, the\nprestige of the sovereign had enormously grown.\nYet this prestige was not merely the outcome of public changes; it was\nan intensely personal matter, too. Victoria was the Queen of England,\nthe Empress of India, the quintessential pivot round which the whole\nmagnificent machine was revolving--but how much more besides! For one\nthing, she was of a great age--an almost indispensable qualification for\npopularity in England. She had given proof of one of the most admired\ncharacteristics of the race--persistent vitality. She had reigned for\nsixty years, and she was not out. And then, she was a character. The\noutlines of her nature were firmly drawn, and, even through the mists\nwhich envelop royalty, clearly visible. In the popular imagination her\nfamiliar figure filled, with satisfying ease, a distinct and memorable\nplace. It was, besides, the kind of figure which naturally called forth\nthe admiring sympathy of the great majority of the nation. Goodness they\nprized above every other human quality; and Victoria, who had said\nthat she would be good at the age of twelve, had kept her word. Duty,\nconscience, morality--yes! in the light of those high beacons the\nQueen had always lived. She had passed her days in work and not in\npleasure--in public responsibilities and family cares. The standard\nof solid virtue which had been set up so long ago amid the domestic\nhappiness of Osborne had never been lowered for an instant. For more\nthan half a century no divorced lady had approached the precincts of the\nCourt. Victoria, indeed, in her enthusiasm for wifely fidelity, had laid\ndown a still stricter ordinance: she frowned severely upon any widow\nwho married again. Considering that she herself was the offspring of\na widow's second marriage, this prohibition might be regarded as an\neccentricity; but, no doubt, it was an eccentricity on the right side.\nThe middle classes, firm in the triple brass of their respectability,\nrejoiced with a special joy over the most respectable of Queens. They\nalmost claimed her, indeed, as one of themselves; but this would have\nbeen an exaggeration. For, though many of her characteristics were most\noften found among the middle classes, in other respects--in her manners,\nfor instance--Victoria was decidedly aristocratic. And, in one important\nparticular, she was neither aristocratic nor middle-class: her attitude\ntoward herself was simply regal.\nSuch qualities were obvious and important; but, in the impact of a\npersonality, it is something deeper, something fundamental and common to\nall its qualities, that really tells. In Victoria, it is easy to discern\nthe nature of this underlying element: it was a peculiar sincerity. Her\ntruthfulness, her single-mindedness, the vividness of her emotions and\nher unrestrained expression of them, were the varied forms which this\ncentral characteristic assumed. It was her sincerity which gave her at\nonce her impressiveness, her charm, and her absurdity. She moved\nthrough life with the imposing certitude of one to whom concealment was\nimpossible--either towards her surroundings or towards herself. There\nshe was, all of her--the Queen of England, complete and obvious; the\nworld might take her or leave her; she had nothing more to show, or to\nexplain, or to modify; and, with her peerless carriage, she swept along\nher path. And not only was concealment out of the question; reticence,\nreserve, even dignity itself, as it sometimes seemed, might be very well\ndispensed with. As Lady Lyttelton said: \"There is a transparency in her\ntruth that is very striking--not a shade of exaggeration in describing\nfeelings or facts; like very few other people I ever knew. Many may be\nas true, but I think it goes often along with some reserve. She talks\nall out; just as it is, no more and no less.\" She talked all out; and\nshe wrote all out, too. Her letters, in the surprising jet of their\nexpression, remind one of a turned-on tap. What is within pours forth\nin an immediate, spontaneous rush. Her utterly unliterary style has at\nleast the merit of being a vehicle exactly suited to her thoughts and\nfeelings; and even the platitude of her phraseology carries with it a\ncuriously personal flavour. Undoubtedly it was through her writings that\nshe touched the heart of the public. Not only in her \"Highland Journals\"\nwhere the mild chronicle of her private proceedings was laid bare\nwithout a trace either of affectation or of embarrassment, but also in\nthose remarkable messages to the nation which, from time to time, she\npublished in the newspapers, her people found her very close to them\nindeed. They felt instinctively Victoria's irresistible sincerity, and\nthey responded. And in truth it was an endearing trait.\nThe personality and the position, too--the wonderful combination of\nthem--that, perhaps, was what was finally fascinating in the case. The\nlittle old lady, with her white hair and her plain mourning clothes,\nin her wheeled chair or her donkey-carriage--one saw her so; and\nthen--close behind--with their immediate suggestion of singularity,\nof mystery, and of power--the Indian servants. That was the familiar\nvision, and it was admirable; but, at chosen moments, it was right that\nthe widow of Windsor should step forth apparent Queen. The last and the\nmost glorious of such occasions was the Jubilee of 1897. Then, as\nthe splendid procession passed along, escorting Victoria through the\nthronged re-echoing streets of London on her progress of thanksgiving\nto St. Paul's Cathedral, the greatness of her realm and the adoration\nof her subjects blazed out together. The tears welled to her eyes, and,\nwhile the multitude roared round her, \"How kind they are to me! How kind\nthey are!\" she repeated over and over again. That night her message flew\nover the Empire: \"From my heart I thank my beloved people. May God bless\nthem!\" The long journey was nearly done. But the traveller, who had\ncome so far, and through such strange experiences, moved on with the\nold unfaltering step. The girl, the wife, the aged woman, were the same:\nvitality, conscientiousness, pride, and simplicity were hers to the\nlatest hour.",
