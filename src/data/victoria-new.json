      "text": "On November 6, 1817, died the Princess Charlotte, only child of the\nPrince Regent, and heir to the crown of England. Her short life had\nhardly been a happy one. By nature impulsive, capricious, and vehement,\nshe had always longed for liberty; and she had never possessed it.\nShe had been brought up among violent family quarrels, had been early\nseparated from her disreputable and eccentric mother, and handed over to\nthe care of her disreputable and selfish father. When she was seventeen,\nhe decided to marry her off to the Prince of Orange; she, at first,\nacquiesced; but, suddenly falling in love with Prince Augustus of\nPrussia, she determined to break off the engagement. This was not her\nfirst love affair, for she had previously carried on a clandestine\ncorrespondence with a Captain Hess. Prince Augustus was already married,\nmorganatically, but she did not know it, and he did not tell her. While\nshe was spinning out the negotiations with the Prince of Orange, the\nallied sovereign--it was June, 1814--arrived in London to celebrate\ntheir victory. Among them, in the suite of the Emperor of Russia, was\nthe young and handsome Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. He made several\nattempts to attract the notice of the Princess, but she, with her heart\nelsewhere, paid very little attention. Next month the Prince Regent,\ndiscovering that his daughter was having secret meetings with Prince\nAugustus, suddenly appeared upon the scene and, after dismissing her\nhousehold, sentenced her to a strict seclusion in Windsor Park. \"God\nAlmighty grant me patience!\" she exclaimed, falling on her knees in an\nagony of agitation: then she jumped up, ran down the backstairs and out\ninto the street, hailed a passing cab, and drove to her mother's house\nin Bayswater. She was discovered, pursued, and at length, yielding\nto the persuasions of her uncles, the Dukes of York and Sussex, of\nBrougham, and of the Bishop of Salisbury, she returned to Carlton House\nat two o'clock in the morning. She was immured at Windsor, but no more\nwas heard of the Prince of Orange. Prince Augustus, too, disappeared.\nThe way was at last open to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.\nThis Prince was clever enough to get round the Regent, to impress the\nMinisters, and to make friends with another of the Princess's uncles,\nthe Duke of Kent. Through the Duke he was able to communicate privately\nwith the Princess, who now declared that he was necessary to\nher happiness. When, after Waterloo, he was in Paris, the Duke's\naide-de-camp carried letters backwards and forwards across the Channel.\nIn January 1816 he was invited to England, and in May the marriage took\nplace.\nThe character of Prince Leopold contrasted strangely with that of\nhis wife. The younger son of a German princeling, he was at this time\ntwenty-six years of age; he had served with distinction in the war\nagainst Napoleon; he had shown considerable diplomatic skill at the\nCongress of Vienna; and he was now to try his hand at the task of taming\na tumultuous Princess. Cold and formal in manner, collected in speech,\ncareful in action, he soon dominated the wild, impetuous, generous\ncreature by his side. There was much in her, he found, of which he could\nnot approve. She quizzed, she stamped, she roared with laughter; she\nhad very little of that self-command which is especially required of\nprinces; her manners were abominable. Of the latter he was a good judge,\nhaving moved, as he himself explained to his niece many years later, in\nthe best society of Europe, being in fact \"what is called in French de\nla fleur des pois.\" There was continual friction, but every scene\nended in the same way. Standing before him like a rebellious boy in\npetticoats, her body pushed forward, her hands behind her back, with\nflaming cheeks and sparkling eyes, she would declare at last that she\nwas ready to do whatever he wanted. \"If you wish it, I will do it,\" she\nwould say. \"I want nothing for myself,\" he invariably answered; \"When\nI press something on you, it is from a conviction that it is for your\ninterest and for your good.\"\nAmong the members of the household at Claremont, near Esher, where the\nroyal pair were established, was a young German physician, Christian\nFriedrich Stockmar. He was the son of a minor magistrate in Coburg, and,\nafter taking part as a medical officer in the war, he had settled down\nas a doctor in his native town. Here he had met Prince Leopold, who had\nbeen struck by his ability, and, on his marriage, brought him to England\nas his personal physician. A curious fate awaited this young man;\nmany were the gifts which the future held in store for him--many and\nvarious--influence, power, mystery, unhappiness, a broken heart. At\nClaremont his position was a very humble one; but the Princess took\na fancy to him, called him \"Stocky,\" and romped with him along the\ncorridors. Dyspeptic by constitution, melancholic by temperament, he\ncould yet be lively on occasion, and was known as a wit in Coburg. He\nwas virtuous, too, and served the royal menage with approbation. \"My\nmaster,\" he wrote in his diary, \"is the best of all husbands in all the\nfive quarters of the globe; and his wife bears him an amount of love,\nthe greatness of which can only be compared with the English national\ndebt.\" Before long he gave proof of another quality--a quality which was\nto colour the whole of his life-cautious sagacity. When, in the spring\nof 1817, it was known that the Princess was expecting a child, the post\nof one of her physicians-in-ordinary was offered to him, and he had\nthe good sense to refuse it. He perceived that his colleagues would be\njealous of him, that his advice would probably not be taken, but that,\nif anything were to go wrong, it would be certainly the foreign doctor\nwho would be blamed. Very soon, indeed, he came to the opinion that the\nlow diet and constant bleedings, to which the unfortunate Princess was\nsubjected, were an error; he drew the Prince aside, and begged him to\ncommunicate this opinion to the English doctors; but it was useless. The\nfashionable lowering treatment was continued for months. On November 5,\nat nine o'clock in the evening, after a labour of over fifty hours, the\nPrincess was delivered of a dead boy. At midnight her exhausted strength\ngave way. When, at last, Stockmar consented to see her; he went in, and\nfound her obviously dying, while the doctors were plying her with wine.\nShe seized his hand and pressed it. \"They have made me tipsy,\" she said.\nAfter a little he left her, and was already in the next room when he\nheard her call out in her loud voice: \"Stocky! Stocky!\" As he ran back\nthe death-rattle was in her throat. She tossed herself violently from\nside to side; then suddenly drew up her legs, and it was over.\nThe Prince, after hours of watching, had left the room for a few\nmoments' rest; and Stockmar had now to tell him that his wife was dead.",

      "text": "The tragedy at Claremont was of a most upsetting kind. The royal\nkaleidoscope had suddenly shifted, and nobody could tell how the new\npattern would arrange itself. The succession to the throne, which had\nseemed so satisfactorily settled, now became a matter of urgent doubt.\nGeorge III was still living, an aged lunatic, at Windsor, completely\nimpervious to the impressions of the outer world. Of his seven sons, the\nyoungest was of more than middle age, and none had legitimate offspring.\nThe outlook, therefore, was ambiguous. It seemed highly improbable that\nthe Prince Regent, who had lately been obliged to abandon his stays, and\npresented a preposterous figure of debauched obesity, could ever again,\neven on the supposition that he divorced his wife and re-married, become\nthe father of a family. Besides the Duke of Kent, who must be noticed\nseparately, the other brothers, in order of seniority, were the Dukes of\nYork, Clarence, Cumberland, Sussex, and Cambridge; their situations and\nprospects require a brief description. The Duke of York, whose escapades\nin times past with Mrs. Clarke and the army had brought him into\ntrouble, now divided his life between London and a large, extravagantly\nordered and extremely uncomfortable country house where he occupied\nhimself with racing, whist, and improper stories. He was remarkable\namong the princes for one reason: he was the only one of them--so we\nare informed by a highly competent observer--who had the feelings of a\ngentleman. He had been long married to the Princess Royal of Prussia,\na lady who rarely went to bed and was perpetually surrounded by vast\nnumbers of dogs, parrots, and monkeys. They had no children. The Duke\nof Clarence had lived for many years in complete obscurity with Mrs.\nJordan, the actress, in Bushey Park. By her he had had a large family\nof sons and daughters, and had appeared, in effect to be married to her,\nwhen he suddenly separated from her and offered to marry Miss Wykeham, a\ncrazy woman of large fortune, who, however, would have nothing to say to\nhim. Shortly afterwards Mrs. Jordan died in distressed circumstances\nin Paris. The Duke of Cumberland was probably the most unpopular man in\nEngland. Hideously ugly, with a distorted eye, he was bad-tempered\nand vindictive in private, a violent reactionary in politics, and was\nsubsequently suspected of murdering his valet and of having carried\non an amorous intrigue of an extremely scandalous kind. He had lately\nmarried a German Princess, but there were as yet no children by the\nmarriage. The Duke of Sussex had mildly literary tastes and collected\nbooks. He had married Lady Augusta Murray, by whom he had two children,\nbut the marriage, under the Royal Marriages Act, was declared void. On\nLady Augusta's death, he married Lady Cecilia Buggin; she changed her\nname to Underwood, but this marriage also was void. Of the Duke of\nCambridge, the youngest of the brothers, not very much was known. He\nlived in Hanover, wore a blonde wig, chattered and fidgeted a great\ndeal, and was unmarried.\nBesides his seven sons, George III had five surviving daughters. Of\nthese, two--the Queen of Wurtemberg and the Duchess of Gloucester--were\nmarried and childless. The three unmarried princesses--Augusta,\nElizabeth, and Sophia--were all over forty.",

      "text": "The fourth son of George III was Edward, Duke of Kent. He was now fifty\nyears of age--a tall, stout, vigorous man, highly-coloured, with bushy\neyebrows, a bald top to his head, and what hair he had carefully dyed a\nglossy black. His dress was extremely neat, and in his whole appearance\nthere was a rigidity which did not belie his character. He had spent\nhis early life in the army--at Gibraltar, in Canada, in the West\nIndies--and, under the influence of military training, had become at\nfirst a disciplinarian and at last a martinet. In 1802, having been sent\nto Gibraltar to restore order in a mutinous garrison, he was recalled\nfor undue severity, and his active career had come to an end. Since then\nhe had spent his life regulating his domestic arrangements with great\nexactitude, busying himself with the affairs of his numerous dependents,\ndesigning clocks, and struggling to restore order to his finances, for,\nin spite of his being, as someone said who knew him well \"regle comme du\npapier a musique,\" and in spite of an income of L24,000 a year, he\nwas hopelessly in debt. He had quarrelled with most of his brothers,\nparticularly with the Prince Regent, and it was only natural that he\nshould have joined the political Opposition and become a pillar of the\nWhigs.\nWhat his political opinions may actually have been is open to doubt; it\nhas often been asserted that he was a Liberal, or even a Radical; and,\nif we are to believe Robert Owen, he was a necessitarian Socialist. His\nrelations with Owen--the shrewd, gullible, high-minded, wrong-headed,\nillustrious and preposterous father of Socialism and Co-operation--were\ncurious and characteristic. He talked of visiting the Mills at New\nLanark, he did, in fact, preside at one of Owen's public meetings;\nhe corresponded with him on confidential terms, and he even (so Owen\nassures us) returned, after his death, from \"the sphere of spirits\" to\ngive encouragement to the Owenites on earth. \"In an especial manner,\"\nsays Owen, \"I have to name the very anxious feelings of the spirit of\nhis Royal Highness the Late Duke of Kent (who early informed me\nthat there were no titles in the spititual spheres into which he had\nentered), to benefit, not a class, a sect, a party, or any particular\ncountry, but the whole of the human race, through futurity.\" \"His whole\nspirit-proceeding with me has been most beautiful,\" Owen adds, \"making\nhis own appointments; and never in one instance has this spirit not\nbeen punctual to the minute he had named.\" But Owen was of a sanguine\ntemperament. He also numbered among his proselytes President Jefferson,\nPrince Metternich, and Napoleon; so that some uncertainty must still\nlinger over the Duke of Kent's views. But there is no uncertainty about\nanother circumstance: his Royal Highness borrowed from Robert Owen, on\nvarious occasions, various sums of money which were never repaid and\namounted in all to several hundred pounds.\nAfter the death of the Princess Charlotte it was clearly important, for\nmore than one reason, that the Duke of Kent should marry. From the point\nof view of the nation, the lack of heirs in the reigning family seemed\nto make the step almost obligatory; it was also likely to be highly\nexpedient from the point of view of the Duke. To marry as a public\nduty, for the sake of the royal succession, would surely deserve some\nrecognition from a grateful country. When the Duke of York had married\nhe had received a settlement of L25,000 a year. Why should not the Duke\nof Kent look forward to an equal sum? But the situation was not quite\nsimple. There was the Duke of Clarence to be considered; he was the\nelder brother, and, if HE married, would clearly have the prior claim.\nOn the other hand, if the Duke of Kent married, it was important\nto remember that he would be making a serious sacrifice: a lady was\ninvolved.\nThe Duke, reflecting upon all these matters with careful attention,\nhappened, about a month after his niece's death, to visit Brussels, and\nlearnt that Mr. Creevey was staying in the town. Mr. Creevey was a close\nfriend of the leading Whigs and an inveterate gossip; and it occurred\nto the Duke that there could be no better channel through which to\ncommunicate his views upon the situation to political circles at home.\nApparently it did not occur to him that Mr. Creevey was malicious and\nmight keep a diary. He therefore sent for him on some trivial pretext,\nand a remarkable conversation ensued.\nAfter referring to the death of the Princess, to the improbability of\nthe Regent's seeking a divorce, to the childlessness of the Duke of\nYork, and to the possibility of the Duke of Clarence marrying, the Duke\nadverted to his own position. \"Should the Duke of Clarence not marry,\"\nhe said, \"the next prince in succession is myself, and although I trust\nI shall be at all times ready to obey any call my country may make upon\nme, God only knows the sacrifice it will be to make, whenever I shall\nthink it my duty to become a married man. It is now seven and twenty\nyears that Madame St. Laurent and I have lived together: we are of\nthe same age, and have been in all climates, and in all difficulties\ntogether, and you may well imagine, Mr. Creevey, the pang it will\noccasion me to part with her. I put it to your own feelings--in the\nevent of any separation between you and Mrs. Creevey... As for Madame\nSt. Laurent herself, I protest I don't know what is to become of her if\na marriage is to be forced upon me; her feelings are already so agitated\nupon the subject.\" The Duke went on to describe how, one morning, a day\nor two after the Princess Charlotte's death, a paragraph had appeared in\nthe Morning Chronicle, alluding to the possibility of his marriage. He\nhad received the newspaper at breakfast together with his letters, and\n\"I did as is my constant practice, I threw the newspaper across the\ntable to Madame St. Laurent, and began to open and read my letters. I\nhad not done so but a very short time, when my attention was called to\nan extraordinary noise and a strong convulsive movement in Madame St.\nLaurent's throat. For a short time I entertained serious apprehensions\nfor her safety; and when, upon her recovery, I enquired into the\noccasion of this attack, she pointed to the article in the Morning\nChronicle.\"\nThe Duke then returned to the subject of the Duke of Clarence. \"My\nbrother the Duke of Clarence is the elder brother, and has certainly the\nright to marry if he chooses, and I would not interfere with him on any\naccount. If he wishes to be king--to be married and have children, poor\nman--God help him! Let him do so. For myself--I am a man of no ambition,\nand wish only to remain as I am... Easter, you know, falls very early\nthis year--the 22nd of March. If the Duke of Clarence does not take any\nstep before that time, I must find some pretext to reconcile Madame St.\nLaurent to my going to England for a short time. When once there, it\nwill be easy for me to consult with my friends as to the proper steps to\nbe taken. Should the Duke of Clarence do nothing before that time as to\nmarrying it will become my duty, no doubt, to take some measures upon\nthe subject myself.\" Two names, the Duke said, had been mentioned in\nthis connection--those of the Princess of Baden and the Princess of\nSaxe-Coburg. The latter, he thought, would perhaps be the better of the\ntwo, from the circumstance of Prince Leopold being so popular with the\nnation; but before any other steps were taken, he hoped and expected to\nsee justice done to Madame St. Laurent. \"She is,\" he explained, \"of very\ngood family, and has never been an actress, and I am the first and only\nperson who ever lived with her. Her disinterestedness, too, has been\nequal to her fidelity. When she first came to me it was upon L100 a\nyear. That sum was afterwards raised to L400 and finally to L1000; but\nwhen my debts made it necessary for me to sacrifice a great part of my\nincome, Madame St. Laurent insisted upon again returning to her income\nof L400 a year. If Madame St. Laurent is to return to live amongst her\nfriends, it must be in such a state of independence as to command their\nrespect. I shall not require very much, but a certain number of servants\nand a carriage are essentials.\" As to his own settlement, the Duke\nobserved that he would expect the Duke of York's marriage to be\nconsidered the precedent. \"That,\" he said, \"was a marriage for the\nsuccession, and L25,000 for income was settled, in addition to all his\nother income, purely on that account. I shall be contented with the same\narrangement, without making any demands grounded on the difference of\nthe value of money in 1792 and at present. As for the payment of my\ndebts,\" the Duke concluded, \"I don't call them great. The nation, on\nthe contrary, is greatly my debtor.\" Here a clock struck, and seemed\nto remind the Duke that he had an appointment; he rose, and Mr. Creevey\nleft him.\nWho could keep such a communication secret? Certainly not Mr. Creevey.",

      "text": "The new Duchess of Kent, Victoria Mary Louisa, was a daughter of\nFrancis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and a sister of Prince Leopold.\nThe family was an ancient one, being a branch of the great House of\nWettin, which since the eleventh century had ruled over the March of\nMeissen on the Elbe. In the fifteenth century the whole possessions of\nthe House had been divided between the Albertine and Ernestine branches:\nfrom the former descended the electors and kings of Saxony; the latter,\nruling over Thuringia, became further subdivided into five branches,\nof which the duchy of Saxe-Coburg was one. This principality was very\nsmall, containing about 60,000 inhabitants, but it enjoyed independent\nand sovereign rights. During the disturbed years which followed the\nFrench Revolution, its affairs became terribly involved. The Duke was\nextravagant, and kept open house for the swarms of refugees, who fled\neastward over Germany as the French power advanced. Among these was the\nPrince of Leiningen, an elderly beau, whose domains on the Moselle\nhad been seized by the French, but who was granted in compensation\nthe territory of Amorbach in Lower Franconia. In 1803 he married the\nPrincess Victoria, at that time seventeen years of age. Three years\nlater Duke Francis died a ruined man. The Napoleonic harrow passed over\nSaxe-Coburg. The duchy was seized by the French, and the ducal family\nwere reduced to beggary, almost to starvation. At the same time the\nlittle principality of Amorbach was devastated by the French, Russian,\nand Austrian armies, marching and counter-marching across it. For years\nthere was hardly a cow in the country, nor enough grass to feed a\nflock of geese. Such was the desperate plight of the family which, a\ngeneration later, was to have gained a foothold in half the reigning\nHouses of Europe. The Napoleonic harrow had indeed done its work, the\nseed was planted; and the crop would have surprised Napoleon. Prince\nLeopold, thrown upon his own resources at fifteen, made a career for\nhimself and married the heiress of England. The Princess of Leiningen,\nstruggling at Amorbach with poverty, military requisitions, and a\nfutile husband, developed an independence of character and a tenacity of\npurpose which were to prove useful in very different circumstances. In\n1814, her husband died, leaving her with two children and the regency\nof the principality. After her brother's marriage with the Princess\nCharlotte, it was proposed that she should marry the Duke of Kent; but\nshe declined, on the ground that the guardianship of her children and\nthe management of her domains made other ties undesirable. The Princess\nCharlotte's death, however, altered the case; and when the Duke of Kent\nrenewed his offer, she accepted it. She was thirty-two years old--short,\nstout, with brown eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, cheerful and voluble,\nand gorgeously attired in rustling silks and bright velvets.\nShe was certainly fortunate in her contented disposition; for she was\nfated, all through her life, to have much to put up with. Her second\nmarriage, with its dubious prospects, seemed at first to be chiefly a\nsource of difficulties and discomforts. The Duke, declaring that he was\nstill too poor to live in England, moved about with uneasy precision\nthrough Belgium and Germany, attending parades and inspecting barracks\nin a neat military cap, while the English notabilities looked askance,\nand the Duke of Wellington dubbed him the Corporal. \"God damme!\" he\nexclaimed to Mr. Creevey, \"d'ye know what his sisters call him? By God!\nthey call him Joseph Surface!\" At Valenciennes, where there was a\nreview and a great dinner, the Duchess arrived with an old and\nugly lady-in-waiting, and the Duke of Wellington found himself in a\ndifficulty. \"Who the devil is to take out the maid of honour?\" he kept\nasking; but at last he thought of a solution. \"Damme, Freemantle, find\nout the mayor and let him do it.\" So the Mayor of Valenciennes was\nbrought up for the purpose, and--so we learn from Mr. Creevey--\"a\ncapital figure he was.\" A few days later, at Brussels, Mr. Creevey\nhimself had an unfortunate experience. A military school was to be\ninspected--before breakfast. The company assembled; everything was\nhighly satisfactory; but the Duke of Kent continued for so long\nexamining every detail and asking meticulous question after meticulous\nquestion, that Mr. Creevey at last could bear it no longer, and\nwhispered to his neighbour that he was damned hungry. The Duke of\nWellington heard him, and was delighted. \"I recommend you,\" he said,\n\"whenever you start with the royal family in a morning, and particularly\nwith THE CORPORAL, always to breakfast first.\" He and his staff, it\nturned out, had taken that precaution, and the great man amused himself,\nwhile the stream of royal inquiries poured on, by pointing at Mr.\nCreevey from time to time with the remark, \"Voila le monsieur qui n'a\npas dejeune!\"\nSettled down at last at Amorbach, the time hung heavily on the Duke's\nhands. The establishment was small, the country was impoverished; even\nclock-making grew tedious at last. He brooded--for in spite of his piety\nthe Duke was not without a vein of superstition--over the prophecy of\na gipsy at Gibraltar who told him that he was to have many losses and\ncrosses, that he was to die in happiness, and that his only child was\nto be a great queen. Before long it became clear that a child was to be\nexpected: the Duke decided that it should be born in England. Funds were\nlacking for the journey, but his determination was not to be set aside.\nCome what might, he declared, his child must be English-born. A carriage\nwas hired, and the Duke himself mounted the box. Inside were the\nDuchess, her daughter Feodora, a girl of fourteen, with maids, nurses,\nlap-dogs, and canaries. Off they drove--through Germany, through\nFrance: bad roads, cheap inns, were nothing to the rigorous Duke and the\nequable, abundant Duchess. The Channel was crossed, London was reached\nin safety. The authorities provided a set of rooms in Kensington Palace;\nand there, on May 24, 1819, a female infant was born.",

More than this,\nthe Duchess of Kent was young, and the Duke was strong; there was every\nlikelihood that before long a brother would follow, to snatch her faint\nchance of the succession from the little princess.\nNevertheless, the Duke had other views: there were prophecies... At any\nrate, he would christen the child Elizabeth, a name of happy augury. In\nthis, however, he reckoned without the Regent, who, seeing a chance\nof annoying his brother, suddenly announced that he himself would be\npresent at the baptism, and signified at the same time that one of the\ngodfathers was to be the Emperor Alexander of Russia. And so when the\nceremony took place, and the Archbishop of Canterbury asked by what name\nhe was to baptise the child, the Regent replied \"Alexandria.\" At\nthis the Duke ventured to suggest that another name might be added.\n\"Certainly,\" said the Regent; \"Georgina?\" \"Or Elizabeth?\" said the Duke.\nThere was a pause, during which the Archbishop, with the baby in his\nlawn sleeves, looked with some uneasiness from one Prince to the other.\n\"Very well, then,\" said the Regent at last, \"call her after her mother.\nBut Alexandrina must come first.\" Thus, to the disgust of her father,\nthe child was christened Alexandrina Victoria.",

The Duke was just able to understand the document, and to\nappend his signature. Having inquired whether his writing was perfectly\nclear, he became unconscious, and breathed his last on the following\nmorning! Six days later came the fulfilment of the second half of the\ngipsy's prophecy. The long, unhappy, and inglorious life of George the\nThird of England was ended.",

The child grew into the girl, the girl into the young woman;\nbut still she slept in her mother's bedroom; still she had no place\nallowed her where she might sit or work by herself. An extraordinary\nwatchfulness surrounded her every step: up to the day of her accession,\nshe never went downstairs without someone beside her holding her hand.\nPlainness and regularity ruled the household. The hours, the days, the\nyears passed slowly and methodically by. The dolls--the innumerable\ndolls, each one so neatly dressed, each one with its name so\npunctiliously entered in the catalogue--were laid aside, and a little\nmusic and a little dancing took their place. Taglioni came, to give\ngrace and dignity to the figure, and Lablache, to train the piping\ntreble upon his own rich bass. The Dean of Chester, the official\npreceptor, continued his endless instruction in Scripture history, while\nthe Duchess of Northumberland, the official governess, presided over\nevery lesson with becoming solemnity. Without doubt, the Princess's main\nachievement during her school-days was linguistic. German was naturally\nthe first language with which she was familiar; but English and French\nquickly followed; and she became virtually trilingual, though her\nmastery of English grammar remained incomplete. At the same time, she\nacquired a working knowledge of Italian and some smattering of Latin.\nNevertheless, she did not read very much. It was not an occupation that\nshe cared for; partly, perhaps, because the books that were given her\nwere all either sermons, which were very dull, or poetry, which was\nincomprehensible. Novels were strictly forbidden. Lord Durham persuaded\nher mother to get her some of Miss Martineau's tales, illustrating the\ntruths of Political Economy, and they delighted her; but it is to be\nfeared that it was the unaccustomed pleasure of the story that filled\nher mind, and that she never really mastered the theory of exchanges or\nthe nature of rent.\nIt was her misfortune that the mental atmosphere which surrounded her\nduring these years of adolescence was almost entirely feminine. No\nfather, no brother, was there to break in upon the gentle monotony of\nthe daily round with impetuosity, with rudeness, with careless laughter\nand wafts of freedom from the outside world. The Princess was never\ncalled by a voice that was loud and growling; never felt, as a matter\nof course, a hard rough cheek on her own soft one; never climbed a wall\nwith a boy. The visits to Claremont--delicious little escapes into male\nsociety--came to an end when she was eleven years old and Prince Leopold\nleft England to be King of the Belgians. She loved him still; he was\nstill \"il mio secondo padre or, rather, solo padre, for he is indeed\nlike my real father, as I have none;\" but his fatherliness now came to\nher dimly and indirectly, through the cold channel of correspondence.\nHenceforward female duty, female elegance, female enthusiasm, hemmed\nher completely in; and her spirit, amid the enclosing folds, was hardly\nreached by those two great influences, without which no growing life can",

      "text": "Germany, and cousins too. When the Princess was fourteen she was\ndelighted by the arrival of a couple of boys from Wurtemberg, the\nPrinces Alexander and Ernst, sons of her mother's sister and the\nreigning duke. \"They are both EXTREMELY TALL,\" she noted, \"Alexander\nis VERY HANDSOME, and Ernst has a VERY KIND EXPRESSION. They are both\nextremely AMIABLE.\" And their departure filled her with corresponding\nregrets. \"We saw them get into the barge, and watched them sailing away\nfor some time on the beach. They were so amiable and so pleasant to\nhave in the house; they were ALWAYS SATISFIED, ALWAYS GOOD-HUMOURED;\nAlexander took such care of me in getting out of the boat, and rode next\nto me; so did Ernst.\" Two years later, two other cousins arrived, the\nPrinces Ferdinand and Augustus. \"Dear Ferdinand,\" the Princess wrote,\n\"has elicited universal admiration from all parties... He is so very\nunaffected, and has such a very distinguished appearance and carriage.\nThey are both very dear and charming young men. Augustus is very\namiable, too, and, when known, shows much good sense.\" On another\noccasion, \"Dear Ferdinand came and sat near me and talked so dearly and\nsensibly. I do SO love him. Dear Augustus sat near me and talked with\nme, and he is also a dear good young man, and is very handsome.\" She\ncould not quite decide which was the handsomer of the two. \"On the\nwhole,\" she concluded, \"I think Ferdinand handsomer than Augustus, his\neyes are so beautiful, and he has such a lively clever expression; BOTH\nhave such a sweet expression; Ferdinand has something QUITE BEAUTIFUL in\nhis expression when he speaks and smiles, and he is SO good.\" However,\nit was perhaps best to say that they were \"both very handsome and VERY\nDEAR.\" But shortly afterwards two more cousins arrived, who threw all\nthe rest into the shade. These were the Princes Ernest and Albert, sons\nof her mother's eldest brother, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg. This time\nthe Princess was more particular in her observations. \"Ernest,\" she\nremarked, \"is as tall as Ferdinand and Augustus; he has dark hair, and\nfine dark eyes and eyebrows, but the nose and mouth are not good; he has\na most kind, honest, and intelligent expression in his countenance,\nand has a very good figure. Albert, who is just as tall as Ernest but\nstouter, is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as\nmine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a\nvery sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance\nis his expression, which is most delightful; c'est a la fois full of\ngoodness and sweetness, and very clever and intelligent.\" \"Both my\ncousins,\" she added, \"are so kind and good; they are much more formes\nand men of the world than Augustus; they speak English very well, and I\nspeak it with them. Ernest will be 18 years old on the 21st of June, and\nAlbert 17 on the 26th of August.

      "text": "King William could not away with his sister-in-law, and the Duchess\nfully returned his antipathy. Without considerable tact and considerable\nforbearance their relative positions were well calculated to cause\nill-feeling; and there was very little tact in the composition of the\nDuchess, and no forbearance at all in that of his Majesty. A bursting,\nbubbling old gentleman, with quarterdeck gestures, round rolling eyes,\nand a head like a pineapple, his sudden elevation to the throne after\nfifty-six years of utter insignificance had almost sent him crazy. His\nnatural exuberance completely got the best of him; he rushed about doing\npreposterous things in an extraordinary manner, spreading amusement\nand terror in every direction, and talking all the time. His tongue\nwas decidedly Hanoverian, with its repetitions, its catchwords--\"That's\nquite another thing! That's quite another thing!\"--its rattling\nindomitability, its loud indiscreetness. His speeches, made repeatedly\nat the most inopportune junctures, and filled pell-mell with all the\nfancies and furies that happened at the moment to be whisking about\nin his head, were the consternation of Ministers. He was one part\nblackguard, people said, and three parts buffoon; but those who knew\nhim better could not help liking him--he meant well; and he was really\ngood-humoured and kind-hearted, if you took him the right way. If you\ntook him the wrong way, however, you must look out for squalls, as the\nDuchess of Kent discovered.\nShe had no notion of how to deal with him--could not understand him in\nthe least. Occupied with her own position, her own responsibilities, her\nduty, and her daughter, she had no attention to spare for the peppery\nsusceptibilities of a foolish, disreputable old man. She was the mother\nof the heiress of England; and it was for him to recognise the fact--to\nput her at once upon a proper footing--to give her the precedence of a\ndowager Princess of Wales, with a large annuity from the privy purse.\nIt did not occur to her that such pretensions might be galling to a king\nwho had no legitimate child of his own, and who yet had not altogether\nabandoned the hope of having one. She pressed on, with bulky vigour,\nalong the course she had laid out. Sir John Conroy, an Irishman with\nno judgment and a great deal of self-importance, was her intimate\ncounsellor, and egged her on. It was advisable that Victoria should\nbecome acquainted with the various districts of England, and through\nseveral summers a succession of tours--in the West, in the Midlands, in\nWales--were arranged for her. The intention of the plan was excellent,\nbut its execution was unfortunate. The journeys, advertised in\nthe Press, attracting enthusiastic crowds, and involving official\nreceptions, took on the air of royal progresses. Addresses were\npresented by loyal citizens, the delighted Duchess, swelling in sweeping\nfeathers and almost obliterating the diminutive Princess, read aloud,\nin her German accent, gracious replies prepared beforehand by Sir\nJohn, who, bustling and ridiculous, seemed to be mingling the roles\nof major-domo and Prime Minister. Naturally the King fumed over his\nnewspaper at Windsor. \"That woman is a nuisance!\" he exclaimed. Poor\nQueen Adelaide, amiable though disappointed, did her best to smooth\nthings down, changed the subject, and wrote affectionate letters to\nVictoria; but it was useless. News arrived that the Duchess of Kent,\nsailing in the Solent, had insisted that whenever her yacht appeared it\nshould be received by royal salutes from all the men-of-war and all the\nforts. The King declared that these continual poppings must cease; the\nPremier and the First Lord of the Admiralty were consulted; and they\nwrote privately to the Duchess, begging her to waive her rights. But\nshe would not hear of it; Sir John Conroy was adamant. \"As her Royal\nHighness's CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER,\" he said, \"I cannot recommend her\nto give way on this point.\" Eventually the King, in a great state of\nexcitement, issued a special Order in Council, prohibiting the firing\nof royal salutes to any ships except those which carried the reigning\nsovereign or his consort on board.\nWhen King William quarrelled with his Whig Ministers the situation grew\nstill more embittered, for now the Duchess, in addition to her other\nshortcomings, was the political partisan of his enemies. In 1836 he\nmade an attempt to prepare the ground for a match between the Princess\nVictoria and one of the sons of the Prince of Orange, and at the same\ntime did his best to prevent the visit of the young Coburg princes to\nKensington. He failed in both these objects; and the only result of\nhis efforts was to raise the anger of the King of the Belgians, who,\nforgetting for a moment his royal reserve, addressed an indignant letter\non the subject to his niece. \"I am really ASTONISHED,\" he wrote, \"at\nthe conduct of your old Uncle the King; this invitation of the Prince\nof Orange and his sons, this forcing him on others, is very\nextraordinary... Not later than yesterday I got a half-official\ncommunication from England, insinuating that it would be HIGHLY\ndesirable that the visit of YOUR relatives SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE\nTHIS YEAR--qu'en dites-vous? The relations of the Queen and the King,\ntherefore, to the God-knows-what degree, are to come in shoals and rule\nthe land, when YOUR RELATIONS are to be FORBIDDEN the country, and\nthat when, as you know, the whole of your relations have ever been very\ndutiful and kind to the King. Really and truly I never heard or saw\nanything like it, and I hope it will a LITTLE ROUSE YOUR SPIRIT;\nnow that slavery is even abolished in the British Colonies, I do not\ncomprehend WHY YOUR LOT ALONE SHOULD BE TO BE KEPT A WHITE LITTLE SLAVEY\nIN ENGLAND, for the pleasure of the Court, who never bought you, as I am\nnot aware of their ever having gone to any expense on that head, or\nthe King's ever having SPENT A SIXPENCE FOR YOUR EXISTENCE... Oh,\nconsistency and political or OTHER HONESTY, where must one look for\nyou!\"\nShortly afterwards King Leopold came to England himself, and his\nreception was as cold at Windsor as it was warm at Kensington. \"To hear\ndear Uncle speak on any subject,\" the Princess wrote in her diary,\n\"is like reading a highly instructive book; his conversation is so\nenlightened, so clear. He is universally admitted to be one of the first\npoliticians now extant. He speaks so mildly, yet firmly and impartially,\nabout politics. Uncle tells me that Belgium is quite a pattern for its\norganisation, its industry, and prosperity; the finances are in the\ngreatest perfection. Uncle is so beloved and revered by his Belgian\nsubjects, that it must be a great compensation for all his extreme\ntrouble.\" But her other uncle by no means shared her sentiments. He\ncould not, he said, put up with a water-drinker; and King Leopold would\ntouch no wine. \"What's that you're drinking, sir?\" he asked him one day\nat dinner. \"Water, sir.\" \"God damn it, sir!\" was the rejoinder. \"Why\ndon't you drink wine? I never allow anybody to drink water at my table.\"\nIt was clear that before very long there would be a great explosion; and\nin the hot days of August it came. The Duchess and the Princess had\ngone down to stay at Windsor for the King's birthday party, and the King\nhimself, who was in London for the day to prorogue Parliament, paid a\nvisit at Kensington Palace in their absence. There he found that the\nDuchess had just appropriated, against his express orders, a suite of\nseventeen apartments for her own use. He was extremely angry, and, when\nhe returned to Windsor, after greeting the Princess with affection, he\npublicly rebuked the Duchess for what she had done. But this was little\nto what followed. On the next day was the birthday banquet; there were\na hundred guests; the Duchess of Kent sat on the King's right hand, and\nthe Princess Victoria opposite. At the end of the dinner, in reply\nto the toast of the King's health, he rose, and, in a long, loud,\npassionate speech, poured out the vials of his wrath upon the Duchess.\nShe had, he declared, insulted him--grossly and continually; she had\nkept the Princess away from him in the most improper manner; she was\nsurrounded by evil advisers, and was incompetent to act with propriety\nin the high station which she filled; but he would bear it no longer; he\nwould have her to know he was King; he was determined that his authority\nshould be respected; henceforward the Princess should attend at every\nCourt function with the utmost regularity; and he hoped to God that his\nlife might be spared for six months longer, so that the calamity of a\nregency might be avoided, and the functions of the Crown pass directly\nto the heiress-presumptive instead of into the hands of the \"person now\nnear him,\" upon whose conduct and capacity no reliance whatever could\nbe placed. The flood of vituperation rushed on for what seemed an\ninterminable period, while the Queen blushed scarlet, the Princess burst\ninto tears, and the hundred guests sat aghast. The Duchess said not a\nword until the tirade was over and the company had retired; then in\na tornado of rage and mortification, she called for her carriage and\nannounced her immediate return to Kensington. It was only with the\nutmost difficulty that some show of a reconciliation was patched up, and\nthe outraged lady was prevailed upon to put off her departure till the\nmorrow.",

      "text": "The King had prayed that he might live till his niece was of age; and\na few days before her eighteenth birthday--the date of her legal\nmajority--a sudden attack of illness very nearly carried him off. He\nrecovered, however, and the Princess was able to go through her\nbirthday festivities--a state ball and a drawing-room--with unperturbed\nenjoyment. \"Count Zichy,\" she noted in her diary, \"is very good-looking\nin uniform, but not in plain clothes. Count Waldstein looks remarkably\nwell in his pretty Hungarian uniform.\" With the latter young gentleman\nshe wished to dance, but there was an insurmountable difficulty. \"He\ncould not dance quadrilles, and, as in my station I unfortunately cannot\nvalse and gallop, I could not dance with him.\" Her birthday present\nfrom the King was of a pleasing nature, but it led to a painful domestic\nscene. In spite of the anger of her Belgian uncle, she had remained upon\ngood terms with her English one. He had always been very kind to her,\nand the fact that he had quarrelled with her mother did not appear to\nbe a reason for disliking him. He was, she said, \"odd, very odd and\nsingular,\" but \"his intentions were often ill interpreted.\" He now wrote\nher a letter, offering her an allowance of L10,000 a year, which he\nproposed should be at her own disposal, and independent of her mother.\nLord Conyngham, the Lord Chamberlain, was instructed to deliver the\nletter into the Princess's own hands. When he arrived at Kensington, he\nwas ushered into the presence of the Duchess and the Princess, and, when\nhe produced the letter, the Duchess put out her hand to take it. Lord\nConyngham begged her Royal Highness's pardon, and repeated the King's\ncommands. Thereupon the Duchess drew back, and the Princess took the\nletter. She immediately wrote to her uncle, accepting his kind proposal.\nThe Duchess was much displeased; L4000 a year, she said, would be quite\nenough for Victoria; as for the remaining L6000, it would be only proper\nthat she should have that herself.\nKing William had thrown off his illness, and returned to his normal\nlife. Once more the royal circle at Windsor--their Majesties, the elder\nPrincesses, and some unfortunate Ambassadress or Minister's wife--might\nbe seen ranged for hours round a mahogany table, while the Queen netted\na purse, and the King slept, occasionally waking from his slumbers to\nobserve \"Exactly so, ma'am, exactly so!\" But this recovery was of short\nduration. The old man suddenly collapsed; with no specific symptoms\nbesides an extreme weakness, he yet showed no power of rallying; and it\nwas clear to everyone that his death was now close at hand.\nAll eyes, all thoughts, turned towards the Princess Victoria; but she\nstill remained, shut away in the seclusion of Kensington, a small,\nunknown figure, lost in the large shadow of her mother's domination. The\npreceding year had in fact been an important one in her development. The\nsoft tendrils of her mind had for the first time begun to stretch out\ntowards unchildish things. In this King Leopold encouraged her. After\nhis return to Brussels, he had resumed his correspondance in a more\nserious strain; he discussed the details of foreign politics; he laid\ndown the duties of kingship; he pointed out the iniquitous foolishness\nof the newspaper press. On the latter subject, indeed, he wrote with\nsome asperity. \"If all the editors,\" he said, \"of the papers in the\ncountries where the liberty of the press exists were to be assembled, we\nshould have a crew to which you would NOT confide a dog that you would\nvalue, still less your honour and reputation.\" On the functions of a\nmonarch, his views were unexceptionable. \"The business of the highest\nin a State,\" he wrote, \"is certainly, in my opinion, to act with great\nimpartiality and a spirit of justice for the good of all.\" At the\nsame time the Princess's tastes were opening out. Though she was still\npassionately devoted to riding and dancing, she now began to have a\ngenuine love of music as well, and to drink in the roulades and arias\nof the Italian opera with high enthusiasm. She even enjoyed reading\npoetry--at any rate, the poetry of Sir Walter Scott.\nWhen King Leopold learnt that King William's death was approaching, he\nwrote several long letters of excellent advice to his niece. \"In every\nletter I shall write to you,\" he said, \"I mean to repeat to you, as a\nFUNDAMENTAL RULE, TO BE FIRM, AND COURAGEOUS, AND HONEST, AS YOU HAVE\nBEEN TILL NOW.\" For the rest, in the crisis that was approaching, she\nwas not to be alarmed, but to trust in her \"good natural sense and the\nTRUTH\" of her character; she was to do nothing in a hurry; to hurt\nno one's amour-propre, and to continue her confidence in the Whig\nadministration! Not content with letters, however, King Leopold\ndetermined that the Princess should not lack personal guidance, and sent\nover to her aid the trusted friend whom, twenty years before, he had\ntaken to his heart by the death-bed at Claremont. Thus, once again, as\nif in accordance with some preordained destiny, the figure of Stockmar\nis discernible--inevitably present at a momentous hour.\nOn June 18, the King was visibly sinking. The Archbishop of Canterbury\nwas by his side, with all the comforts of the church. Nor did the holy\nwords fall upon a rebellious spirit; for many years his Majesty had\nbeen a devout believer. \"When I was a young man,\" he once explained at\na public banquet, \"as well as I can remember, I believed in nothing but\npleasure and folly--nothing at all. But when I went to sea, got into\na gale, and saw the wonders of the mighty deep, then I believed; and I\nhave been a sincere Christian ever since.\" It was the anniversary of the\nBattle of Waterloo, and the dying man remembered it. He should be glad\nto live, he said, over that day; he would never see another sunset. \"I\nhope your Majesty may live to see many,\" said Dr. Chambers. \"Oh! that's\nquite another thing, that's quite another thing,\" was the answer. One\nother sunset he did live to see; and he died in the early hours of the\nfollowing morning. It was on June 20, 1837.",

They arrived\nat the Palace at five o'clock, and it was only with considerable\ndifficulty that they gained admittance. At six the Duchess woke up\nher daughter, and told her that the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord\nConyngham were there, and wished to see her. She got out of bed, put on\nher dressing-gown, and went, alone, into the room where the messengers\nwere standing. Lord Conyngham fell on his knees, and officially\nannounced the death of the King; the Archbishop added some personal\ndetails. Looking at the bending, murmuring dignitaries before her, she\nknew that she was Queen of England. \"Since it has pleased Providence,\"\nshe wrote that day in her journal, \"to place me in this station, I shall\ndo my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young, and\nperhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am sure,\nthat very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what\nis fit and right than I have.\" But there was scant time for resolutions\nand reflections. At once, affairs were thick upon her. Stockmar came to\nbreakfast, and gave some good advice. She wrote a letter to her uncle\nLeopold, and a hurried note to her sister Feodora. A letter came from\nthe Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, announcing his approaching arrival.\nHe came at nine, in full court dress, and kissed her hand. She saw him\nalone, and repeated to him the lesson which, no doubt, the faithful\nStockmar had taught her at breakfast. \"It has long been my intention to\nretain your Lordship and the rest of the present Ministry at the head\nof affairs;\" whereupon Lord Melbourne again kissed her hand and shortly\nafter left her. She then wrote a letter of condolence to Queen Adelaide.\nAt eleven, Lord Melbourne came again; and at half-past eleven she went\ndownstairs into the red saloon to hold her first Council. The great\nassembly of lords and notables, bishops, generals, and Ministers of\nState, saw the doors thrown open and a very short, very slim girl in\ndeep plain mourning come into the room alone and move forward to her\nseat with extraordinary dignity and grace; they saw a countenance, not\nbeautiful, but prepossessing--fair hair, blue prominent eyes, a small\ncurved nose, an open mouth revealing the upper teeth, a tiny chin,\na clear complexion, and, over all, the strangely mingled signs of\ninnocence, of gravity, of youth, and of composure; they heard a high\nunwavering voice reading aloud with perfect clarity; and then, the\nceremony was over, they saw the small figure rise and, with the same\nconsummate grace, the same amazing dignity, pass out from among them, as\nshe had come in, alone.",

Her private\nlife had been that of a novice in a convent: hardly a human being from\nthe outside world had ever spoken to her; and no human being at all,\nexcept her mother and the Baroness Lehzen, had ever been alone with\nher in a room. Thus it was not only the public at large that was in\nignorance of everything concerning her; the inner circles of statesmen\nand officials and high-born ladies were equally in the dark. When she\nsuddenly emerged from this deep obscurity, the impression that she\ncreated was immediate and profound. Her bearing at her first Council\nfilled the whole gathering with astonishment and admiration; the Duke of\nWellington, Sir Robert Peel, even the savage Croker, even the cold and\ncaustic Greville--all were completely carried away. Everything that was\nreported of her subsequent proceedings seemed to be of no less happy\naugury. Her perceptions were quick, her decisions were sensible, her\nlanguage was discreet; she performed her royal duties with extraordinary\nfacility. Among the outside public there was a great wave of enthusiasm.\nSentiment and romance were coming into fashion; and the spectacle of\nthe little girl-queen, innocent, modest, with fair hair and pink cheeks,\ndriving through her capital, filled the hearts of the beholders with\nraptures of affectionate loyalty. What, above all, struck everybody\nwith overwhelming force was the contrast between Queen Victoria and\nher uncles. The nasty old men, debauched and selfish, pig-headed and\nridiculous, with their perpetual burden of debts, confusions, and\ndisreputabilities--they had vanished like the snows of winter, and here\nat last, crowned and radiant, was the spring. Lord John Russell, in an\nelaborate oration, gave voice to the general sentiment. He hoped that\nVictoria might prove an Elizabeth without her tyranny, an Anne without\nher weakness. He asked England to pray that the illustrious Princess who\nhad just ascended the throne with the purest intentions and the justest\ndesires might see slavery abolished, crime diminished, and education\nimproved. He trusted that her people would henceforward derive their\nstrength, their conduct, and their loyalty from enlightened religious\nand moral principles, and that, so fortified, the reign of Victoria\nmight prove celebrated to posterity and to all the nations of the earth.",

The\npastor's daughter observed the ruin of her enemies. Discreet and\nvictorious, she remained in possession of the field. More closely than\never did she cleave to the side of her mistress, her pupil, and her\nfriend; and in the recesses of the palace her mysterious figure was at\nonce invisible and omnipresent.

Nobody knew--nobody ever will know--the precise\nextent and the precise nature of her influence. She herself declared\nthat she never discussed public affairs with the Queen, that she was\nconcerned with private matters only--with private letters and the\ndetails of private life. Certainly her hand is everywhere discernible in\nVictoria's early correspondence. The Journal is written in the style of\na child; the Letters are not so simple; they are the work of a\nchild, rearranged--with the minimum of alteration, no doubt, and yet\nperceptibly--by a governess. And the governess was no fool: narrow,\njealous, provincial, she might be; but she was an acute and vigorous\nwoman, who had gained by a peculiar insight, a peculiar ascendancy. That\nascendancy she meant to keep. No doubt it was true that technically she\ntook no part in public business; but the distinction between what is\npublic and what is private is always a subtle one; and in the case of\na reigning sovereign--as the next few years were to show--it is often\nimaginary. Considering all things--the characters of the persons, and\nthe character of the times--it was something more than a mere matter\nof private interest that the bedroom of Baroness Lehzen at Buckingham\nPalace should have been next door to the bedroom of the Queen.",

During the twenty years which had elapsed since the death of the\nPrincess Charlotte, his experiences had been varied and remarkable. The\nunknown counsellor of a disappointed princeling had gradually risen to a\nposition of European importance. His devotion to his master had been not\nonly whole--hearted but cautious and wise. It was Stockmar's advice\nthat had kept Prince Leopold in England during the critical years which\nfollowed his wife's death, and had thus secured to him the essential\nrequisite of a point d'appui in the country of his adoption. It was\nStockmar's discretion which had smoothed over the embarrassments\nsurrounding the Prince's acceptance and rejection of the Greek crown.\nIt was Stockmar who had induced the Prince to become the constitutional\nSovereign of Belgium. Above all, it was Stockmar's tact, honesty, and\ndiplomatic skill which, through a long series of arduous and complicated\nnegotiations, had led to the guarantee of Belgian neutrality by the\nGreat Powers. His labours had been rewarded by a German barony and by\nthe complete confidence of King Leopold. Nor was it only in Brussels\nthat he was treated with respect and listened to with attention.\nThe statesmen who governed England--Lord Grey, Sir Robert Peel, Lord\nPalmerston, Lord Melbourne--had learnt to put a high value upon his\nprobity and his intelligence. \"He is one of the cleverest fellows I\never saw,\" said Lord Melbourne, \"the most discreet man, the most\nwell-judging, and most cool man.\" And Lord Palmerston cited Baron\nStockmar as the only absolutely disinterested man he had come across in\nlife, At last he was able to retire to Coburg, and to enjoy for a few\nyears the society of the wife and children whom his labours in the\nservice of his master had hitherto only allowed him to visit at long\nintervals for a month or two at a time. But in 1836 he had been again\nentrusted with an important negotiation, which he had brought to\na successful conclusion in the marriage of Prince Ferdinand of\nSaxe-Coburg, a nephew of King Leopold's, with Queen Maria II of\nPortugal. The House of Coburg was beginning to spread over Europe; and\nthe establishment of the Baron at Buckingham Palace in 1837 was to be\nthe prelude of another and a more momentous advance.\nKing Leopold and his counsellor provide in their careers an example\nof the curious diversity of human ambitions. The desires of man are\nwonderfully various; but no less various are the means by which those\ndesires may reach satisfaction: and so the work of the world gets done.\nThe correct mind of Leopold craved for the whole apparatus of royalty.\nMere power would have held no attractions for him; he must be an actual\nking--the crowned head of a people. It was not enough to do; it was\nessential also to be recognised; anything else would not be fitting.\nThe greatness that he dreamt of was surrounded by every appropriate\ncircumstance. To be a Majesty, to be a cousin of Sovereigns, to marry a\nBourbon for diplomatic ends, to correspond with the Queen of England,\nto be very stiff and very punctual, to found a dynasty, to bore\nambassadresses into fits, to live, on the highest pinnacle, an exemplary\nlife devoted to the public service--such were his objects, and such,\nin fact, were his achievements. The \"Marquis Peu-a-peu,\" as George IV\ncalled him, had what he wanted. But this would never have been the case\nif it had not happened that the ambition of Stockmar took a form exactly\ncomplementary to his own. The sovereignty that the Baron sought for\nwas by no means obvious. The satisfaction of his essential being lay\nin obscurity, in invisibility--in passing, unobserved, through a hidden\nentrance, into the very central chamber of power, and in sitting there,\nquietly, pulling the subtle strings that set the wheels of the\nwhole world in motion. A very few people, in very high places, and\nexceptionally well-informed, knew that Baron Stockmar was a most\nimportant person: that was enough. The fortunes of the master and the\nservant, intimately interacting, rose together. The Baron's secret skill\nhad given Leopold his unexceptionable kingdom; and Leopold, in his turn,\nas time went on, was able to furnish the Baron with more and more keys\nto more and more back doors.\nStockmar took up his abode in the Palace partly as the emissary of King",

      "text": "III\nWilliam Lamb, Viscount Melbourne, was fifty-eight years of age, and\nhad been for the last three years Prime Minister of England. In every\noutward respect he was one of the most fortunate of mankind. He had\nbeen born into the midst of riches, brilliance, and power. His mother,\nfascinating and intelligent, had been a great Whig hostess, and he had\nbeen bred up as a member of that radiant society which, during the\nlast quarter of the eighteenth century, concentrated within itself\nthe ultimate perfections of a hundred years of triumphant aristocracy.\nNature had given him beauty and brains; the unexpected death of an\nelder brother brought him wealth, a peerage, and the possibility of\nhigh advancement. Within that charmed circle, whatever one's personal\ndisabilities, it was difficult to fail; and to him, with all his\nadvantages, success was well-nigh unavoidable. With little effort, he\nattained political eminence. On the triumph of the Whigs he became one\nof the leading members of the Government; and when Lord Grey retired\nfrom the premiership he quietly stepped into the vacant place. Nor was\nit only in the visible signs of fortune that Fate had been kind to him.\nBound to succeed, and to succeed easily, he was gifted with so fine\na nature that his success became him. His mind, at once supple and\ncopious, his temperament, at once calm and sensitive, enabled him not\nmerely to work, but to live with perfect facility and with the grace of\nstrength. In society he was a notable talker, a captivating companion,\na charming man. If one looked deeper, one saw at once that he was not\nordinary, that the piquancies of his conversation and his manner--his\nfree-and-easy vaguenesses, his abrupt questions, his lollings and\nloungings, his innumerable oaths--were something more than an amusing\nornament, were the outward manifestation of an individuality that was\nfundamental.\nThe precise nature of this individuality was very difficult to gauge: it\nwas dubious, complex, perhaps self--contradictory. Certainly there was\nan ironical discordance between the inner history of the man and his\napparent fortunes. He owed all he had to his birth, and his birth was\nshameful; it was known well enough that his mother had passionately\nloved Lord Egremont, and that Lord Melbourne was not his father. His\nmarriage, which had seemed to be the crown of his youthful ardours,\nwas a long, miserable, desperate failure: the incredible Lady Caroline,\n\"With pleasures too refined to please, With too much spirit to be\ne'er at ease, With too much quickness to be ever taught, With too much\nthinking to have common thought,\" was very nearly the destruction of\nhis life. When at last he emerged from the anguish and confusion of her\nfolly, her extravagance, her rage, her despair, and her devotion, he was\nleft alone with endless memories of intermingled farce and tragedy, and\nan only son, who was an imbecile. But there was something else that he\nowed to Lady Caroline. While she whirled with Byron in a hectic frenzy\nof love and fashion, he had stayed at home in an indulgence bordering\non cynicism, and occupied his solitude with reading. It was thus that he\nhad acquired those habits of study, that love of learning, and that wide\nand accurate knowledge of ancient and modern literature, which formed so\nunexpected a part of his mental equipment. His passion for reading never\ndeserted him; even when he was Prime Minister he found time to\nmaster every new important book. With an incongruousness that was\ncharacteristic, his favourite study was theology. An accomplished\nclassical scholar, he was deeply read in the Fathers of the Church;\nheavy volumes of commentary and exegesis he examined with scrupulous\ndiligence; and at any odd moment he might be found turning over the\npages of the Bible. To the ladies whom he most liked, he would lend some\nlearned work on the Revelation, crammed with marginal notes in his own\nhand, or Dr. Lardner's \"Observations upon the Jewish Errors with respect\nto the Conversion of Mary Magdalene.\" The more pious among them had high\nhopes that these studies would lead him into the right way; but of this\nthere were no symptoms in his after-dinner conversations.\nThe paradox of his political career was no less curious. By temperament\nan aristocrat, by conviction a conservative, he came to power as the\nleader of the popular party, the party of change. He had profoundly\ndisliked the Reform Bill, which he had only accepted at last as\na necessary evil; and the Reform Bill lay at the root of the very\nexistence, of the very meaning, of his government. He was far too\nsceptical to believe in progress of any kind. Things were best as they\nwere or rather, they were least bad. \"You'd better try to do no good,\"\nwas one of his dictums, \"and then you'll get into no scrapes.\" Education\nat best was futile; education of the poor was positively dangerous. The\nfactory children? \"Oh, if you'd only have the goodness to leave them\nalone!\" Free Trade was a delusion; the ballot was nonsense; and there\nwas no such thing as a democracy.\nNevertheless, he was not a reactionary; he was simply an opportunist.\nThe whole duty of government, he said, was \"to prevent crime and to\npreserve contracts.\" All one could really hope to do was to carry on. He\nhimself carried on in a remarkable manner--with perpetual compromises,\nwith fluctuations and contradictions, with every kind of weakness, and\nyet with shrewdness, with gentleness, even with conscientiousness, and\na light and airy mastery of men and of events. He conducted the\ntransactions of business with extraordinary nonchalance. Important\npersons, ushered up for some grave interview, found him in a\ntowselled bed, littered with books and papers, or vaguely shaving in a\ndressing-room; but, when they went downstairs again, they would realise\nthat somehow or other they had been pumped. When he had to receive a\ndeputation, he could hardly ever do so with becoming gravity. The worthy\ndelegates of the tallow-chandlers, or the Society for the Abolition of\nCapital Punishment, were distressed and mortified when, in the midst of\ntheir speeches, the Prime Minister became absorbed in blowing a feather,\nor suddenly cracked an unseemly joke. How could they have guessed that\nhe had spent the night before diligently getting up the details of their\ncase? He hated patronage and the making of appointments--a feeling rare\nin Ministers. \"As for the Bishops,\" he burst out, \"I positively believe\nthey die to vex me.\" But when at last the appointment was made, it\nwas made with keen discrimination. His colleagues observed another\nsymptom--was it of his irresponsibility or his wisdom? He went to sleep\nin the Cabinet.\nProbably, if he had been born a little earlier, he would have been a\nsimpler and a happier man. As it was, he was a child of the eighteenth\ncentury whose lot was cast in a new, difficult, unsympathetic age.\nHe was an autumn rose. With all his gracious amenity, his humour, his\nhappy-go-lucky ways, a deep disquietude possessed him. A sentimental\ncynic, a sceptical believer, he was restless and melancholy at heart.\nAbove all, he could never harden himself; those sensitive petals\nshivered in every wind. Whatever else he might be, one thing was\ncertain: Lord Melbourne was always human, supremely human--too human,\nperhaps.\nAnd now, with old age upon him, his life took a sudden, new,\nextraordinary turn. He became, in the twinkling of an eye, the intimate\nadviser and the daily companion of a young girl who had stepped all at\nonce from a nursery to a throne. His relations with women had been, like\neverything else about him, ambiguous. Nobody had ever been able quite\nto gauge the shifting, emotional complexities of his married life; Lady\nCaroline vanished; but his peculiar susceptibilities remained. Female\nsociety of some kind or other was necessary to him, and he did not\nstint himself; a great part of every day was invariably spent in it. The\nfeminine element in him made it easy, made it natural and inevitable for\nhim to be the friend of a great many women; but the masculine element\nin him was strong as well. In such circumstances it is also easy, it is\neven natural, perhaps it is even inevitable, to be something more than\na friend. There were rumours and combustions. Lord Melbourne was twice a\nco-respondent in a divorce action; but on each occasion he won his suit.\nThe lovely Lady Brandon, the unhappy and brilliant Mrs. Norton... the\nlaw exonerated them both. Beyond that hung an impenetrable veil. But\nat any rate it was clear that, with such a record, the Prime Minister's\nposition in Buckingham Palace must be a highly delicate one. However,\nhe was used to delicacies, and he met the situation with consummate\nsuccess. His behaviour was from the first moment impeccable. His manner\ntowards the young Queen mingled, with perfect facility, the watchfulness\nand the respect of a statesman and a courtier with the tender solicitude\nof a parent. He was at once reverential and affectionate, at once the\nservant and the guide. At the same time the habits of his life underwent\na surprising change. His comfortable, unpunctual days became subject to\nthe unaltering routine of a palace; no longer did he sprawl on sofas;\nnot a single \"damn\" escaped his lips. The man of the world who had been\nthe friend of Byron and the regent, the talker whose paradoxes had held\nHolland House enthralled, the cynic whose ribaldries had enlivened so\nmany deep potations, the lover whose soft words had captivated such\nbeauty and such passion and such wit, might now be seen, evening after",

She found him perfect; and perfect in her sight he\nremained. Her absolute and unconcealed adoration was very natural; what\ninnocent young creature could have resisted, in any circumstances, the\ncharm and the devotion of such a man? But, in her situation, there was\na special influence which gave a peculiar glow to all she felt. After\nyears of emptiness and dullness and suppression, she had come suddenly,\nin the heyday of youth, into freedom and power. She was mistress\nof herself, of great domains and palaces; she was Queen of England.\nResponsibilities and difficulties she might have, no doubt, and in heavy\nmeasure; but one feeling dominated and absorbed all others--the feeling\nof joy. Everything pleased her. She was in high spirits from morning\ntill night. Mr. Creevey, grown old now, and very near his end, catching\na glimpse of her at Brighton, was much amused, in his sharp fashion, by\nthe ingenuous gaiety of \"little Vic.\" \"A more homely little being you\nnever beheld, when she is at her ease, and she is evidently dying to be\nalways more so. She laughs in real earnest, opening her mouth as wide as\nit can go, showing not very pretty gums... She eats quite as heartily\nas she laughs, I think I may say she gobbles... She blushes and laughs\nevery instant in so natural a way as to disarm anybody.\" But it was not\nmerely when she was laughing or gobbling that she enjoyed herself; the\nperformance of her official duties gave her intense satisfaction. \"I\nreally have immensely to do,\" she wrote in her Journal a few days after\nher accession; \"I receive so many communications from my Ministers, but\nI like it very much.\" And again, a week later, \"I repeat what I said\nbefore that I have so many communications from the Ministers, and from\nme to them, and I get so many papers to sign every day, that I have\nalways a very great deal to do. I delight in this work.\" Through the\ngirl's immaturity the vigorous predestined tastes of the woman were\npushing themselves into existence with eager velocity, with delicious\nforce.\nOne detail of her happy situation deserves particular mention. Apart\nfrom the splendour of her social position and the momentousness of her\npolitical one, she was a person of great wealth. As soon as Parliament\nmet, an annuity of L385,000 was settled upon her. When the expenses of\nher household had been discharged, she was left with L68,000 a year of\nher own. She enjoyed besides the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster,\nwhich amounted annually to over L27,000. The first use to which she put\nher money was characteristic: she paid off her father's debts. In\nmoney matters, no less than in other matters, she was determined to be\ncorrect. She had the instincts of a man of business; and she never could\nhave borne to be in a position that was financially unsound.\nWith youth and happiness gilding every hour, the days passed merrily\nenough. And each day hinged upon Lord Melbourne. Her diary shows us,\nwith undiminished clarity, the life of the young sovereign during\nthe early months of her reign--a life satisfactorily regular, full\nof delightful business, a life of simple pleasures, mostly\nphysical--riding, eating, dancing--a quick, easy, highly unsophisticated\nlife, sufficient unto itself. The light of the morning is upon it; and,\nin the rosy radiance, the figure of \"Lord M.\" emerges, glorified and\nsupreme. If she is the heroine of the story, he is the hero; but indeed",

      "text": "distressing behaviour of Uncle Leopold. The King of the Belgians had\nnot been able to resist attempting to make use of his family position\nto further his diplomatic ends. But, indeed, why should there be any\nquestion of resisting? Was not such a course of conduct, far from being\na temptation, simply \"selon les regles?\" What were royal marriages\nfor, if they did not enable sovereigns, in spite of the hindrances of\nconstitutions, to control foreign politics? For the highest purposes,\nof course; that was understood. The Queen of England was his niece--more\nthan that--almost his daughter; his confidential agent was living, in\na position of intimate favour, at her court. Surely, in such\ncircumstances, it would be preposterous, it would be positively\nincorrect, to lose the opportunity of bending to his wishes by means\nof personal influence, behind the backs of the English Ministers, the\nforeign policy of England.\nHe set about the task with becoming precautions. He continued in his\nletters his admirable advice. Within a few days of her accession, he\nrecommended the young Queen to lay emphasis, on every possible occasion,\nupon her English birth; to praise the English nation; \"the Established\nChurch I also recommend strongly; you cannot, without PLEDGING yourself\nto anything PARTICULAR, SAY TOO MUCH ON THE SUBJECT.\" And then \"before\nyou decide on anything important I should be glad if you would consult\nme; this would also have the advantage of giving you time;\" nothing was\nmore injurious than to be hurried into wrong decisions unawares. His\nniece replied at once with all the accustomed warmth of her affection;\nbut she wrote hurriedly--and, perhaps, a trifle vaguely too. \"YOUR\nadvice is always of the GREATEST IMPORTANCE to me,\" she said.\nHad he, possibly, gone too far? He could not be certain; perhaps\nVictoria HAD been hurried. In any case, he would be careful; he would\ndraw back--\"pour mieux sauter\" he added to himself with a smile. In his\nnext letters he made no reference to his suggestion of consultations\nwith himself; he merely pointed out the wisdom, in general, of refusing\nto decide upon important questions off-hand. So far, his advice was\ntaken; and it was noticed that the Queen, when applications were made to\nher, rarely gave an immediate answer. Even with Lord Melbourne, it was\nthe same; when he asked for her opinion upon any subject, she would\nreply that she would think it over, and tell him her conclusions next\nday.\nKing Leopold's counsels continued. The Princess de Lieven, he said,\nwas a dangerous woman; there was reason to think that she would make\nattempts to pry into what did not concern her, let Victoria beware. \"A\nrule which I cannot sufficiently recommend is NEVER TO PERMIT people\nto speak on subjects concerning yourself or your affairs, without you\nhaving yourself desired them to do so.\" Should such a thing occur,\n\"change the conversation, and make the individual feel that he has made\na mistake.\" This piece of advice was also taken; for it fell out as the\nKing had predicted. Madame de Lieven sought an audience, and appeared\nto be verging towards confidential topics; whereupon the Queen, becoming\nslightly embarrassed, talked of nothing but commonplaces. The individual\nfelt that she had made a mistake.\nThe King's next warning was remarkable. Letters, he pointed out, are\nalmost invariably read in the post. This was inconvenient, no doubt; but\nthe fact, once properly grasped, was not without its advantages. \"I will\ngive you an example: we are still plagued by Prussia concerning those\nfortresses; now to tell the Prussian Government many things, which we\nSHOULD NOT LIKE to tell them officially, the Minister is going to write\na despatch to our man at Berlin, sending it BY POST; the Prussians ARE\nSURE to read it, and to learn in this way what we wish them to hear.\nAnalogous circumstances might very probably occur in England. I tell you\nthe TRICK,\" wrote His Majesty, \"that you should be able to guard against\nit.\" Such were the subtleties of constitutional sovereignty.",

      "text": "The Queen had for long been haunted by a terror that the day might come\nwhen she would be obliged to part with her Minister. Ever since the\npassage of the Reform Bill, the power of the Whig Government had\nsteadily declined. The General Election of 1837 had left them with a\nvery small majority in the House of Commons; since then, they had been\nin constant difflculties--abroad, at home, in Ireland; the Radical group\nhad grown hostile; it became highly doubtful how much longer they could\nsurvive. The Queen watched the development of events in great anxiety.\nShe was a Whig by birth, by upbringing, by every association, public and\nprivate; and, even if those ties had never existed, the mere fact that\nLord M. was the head of the Whigs would have amply sufficed to determine\nher politics. The fall of the Whigs would mean a sad upset for Lord M.\nBut it would have a still more terrible consequence: Lord M. would have\nto leave her; and the daily, the hourly, presence of Lord M. had become\nan integral part of her life. Six months after her accession she had\nnoted in her diary \"I shall be very sorry to lose him even for one\nnight;\" and this feeling of personal dependence on her Minister steadily\nincreased. In these circumstances it was natural that she should have\nbecome a Whig partisan. Of the wider significance of political questions\nshe knew nothing; all she saw was that her friends were in office and\nabout her, and that it would be dreadful if they ceased to be so. \"I\ncannot say,\" she wrote when a critical division was impending, \"(though\nI feel confident of our success) how low, how sad I feel, when I think\nof the possibility of this excellent and truly kind man not remaining my\nMinister! Yet I trust fervently that He who has so wonderfully protected\nme through such manifold difficulties will not now desert me! I should\nhave liked to have expressed to Lord M. my anxiety, but the tears were\nnearer than words throughout the time I saw him, and I felt I should\nhave choked, had I attempted to say anything.\" Lord Melbourne\nrealised clearly enough how undesirable was such a state of mind in\na constitutional sovereign who might be called upon at any moment to\nreceive as her Ministers the leaders of the opposite party; he did what\nhe could to cool her ardour; but in vain.\nWith considerable lack of foresight, too, he had himself helped to bring\nabout this unfortunate condition of affairs. From the moment of her\naccession, he had surrounded the Queen with ladies of his own party; the\nMistress of the Robes and all the Ladies of the Bedchamber were Whigs.\nIn the ordinary course, the Queen never saw a Tory: eventually she took\npains never to see one in any circumstances. She disliked the whole\ntribe; and she did not conceal the fact. She particularly disliked Sir\nRobert Peel, who would almost certainly be the next Prime Minister.\nHis manners were detestable, and he wanted to turn out Lord M. His\nsupporters, without exception, were equally bad; and as for Sir James\nGraham, she could not bear the sight of him; he was exactly like Sir\nJohn Conroy.\nThe affair of Lady Flora intensified these party rumours still further.\nThe Hastings were Tories, and Lord Melbourne and the Court were attacked\nby the Tory press in unmeasured language. The Queen's sectarian\nzeal proportionately increased. But the dreaded hour was now fast\napproaching. Early in May the Ministers were visibly tottering; on a\nvital point of policy they could only secure a majority of five in the\nHouse of Commons; they determined to resign. When Victoria heard the\nnews she burst into tears. Was it possible, then, that all was over? Was\nshe, indeed, about to see Lord M. for the last time? Lord M. came; and\nit is a curious fact that, even in this crowning moment of misery and\nagitation, the precise girl noted, to the minute, the exact time of the\narrival and the departure of her beloved Minister. The conversation was\ntouching and prolonged; but it could only end in one way--the Queen must\nsend for the Duke of Wellington. When, next morning, the Duke came, he\nadvised her Majesty to send for Sir Robert Peel. She was in \"a state of\ndreadful grief,\" but she swallowed down her tears, and braced herself,\nwith royal resolution, for the odious, odious interview.\nPeel was by nature reserved, proud, and shy. His manners were not\nperfect, and he knew it; he was easily embarrassed, and, at such\nmoments, he grew even more stiff and formal than before, while his\nfeet mechanically performed upon the carpet a dancing-master's measure.\nAnxious as he now was to win the Queen's good graces, his very anxiety\nto do so made the attainment of his object the more difficult. He\nentirely failed to make any headway whatever with the haughty hostile\ngirl before him. She coldly noted that he appeared to be unhappy and\n\"put out,\" and, while he stood in painful fixity, with an occasional\nuneasy pointing of the toe, her heart sank within her at the sight of\nthat manner, \"Oh! how different, how dreadfully different, to the\nfrank, open, natural, and most kind warm manner of Lord Melbourne.\"\nNevertheless, the audience passed without disaster. Only at one point\nhad there been some slight hint of a disagreement. Peel had decided that\na change would be necessary in the composition of the royal Household:\nthe Queen must no longer be entirely surrounded by the wives and sisters\nof his opponents; some, at any rate, of the Ladies of the Bedchamber\nshould be friendly to his Government. When this matter was touched\nupon, the Queen had intimated that she wished her Household to remain\nunchanged; to which Sir Robert had replied that the question could be\nsettled later, and shortly afterwards withdrew to arrange the details of\nhis Cabinet. While he was present, Victoria had remained, as she herself\nsaid, \"very much collected, civil and high, and betrayed no agitation;\"\nbut as soon as she was alone she completely broke down. Then she pulled\nherself together to write to Lord Melbourne an account of all that had\nhappened, and of her own wretchedness. \"She feels,\" she said, \"Lord\nMelbourne will understand it, amongst enemies to those she most relied\non and most esteemed; but what is worst of all is the being deprived of\nseeing Lord Melbourne as she used to do.\"\nLord Melbourne replied with a very wise letter. He attempted to calm the\nQueen and to induce her to accept the new position gracefully; and he\nhad nothing but good words for the Tory leaders. As for the question of\nthe Ladies of the Household, the Queen, he said, should strongly urge\nwhat she desired, as it was a matter which concerned her personally,\n\"but,\" he added, \"if Sir Robert is unable to concede it, it will not do\nto refuse and to put off the negotiation upon it.\" On this point there\ncan be little doubt that Lord Melbourne was right. The question was\na complicated and subtle one, and it had never arisen before; but\nsubsequent constitutional practice has determined that a Queen Regnant\nmust accede to the wishes of her Prime Minister as to the personnel of\nthe female part of her Household. Lord Melbourne's wisdom, however, was\nwasted. The Queen would not be soothed, and still less would she take\nadvice. It was outrageous of the Tories to want to deprive her of her\nLadies, and that night she made up her mind that, whatever Sir Robert\nmight say, she would refuse to consent to the removal of a single one\nof them. Accordingly, when, next morning, Peel appeared again, she was\nready for action. He began by detailing the Cabinet appointments, and\nthen he added \"Now, ma'am, about the Ladies-\" when the Queen sharply\ninterrupted him. \"I cannot give up any of my Ladies,\" she said. \"What,\nma'am!\" said Sir Robert, \"does your Majesty mean to retain them all?\"\n\"All,\" said the Queen. Sir Robert's face worked strangely; he could not\nconceal his agitation. \"The Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of\nthe Bedchamber?\" he brought out at last. \"All,\" replied once more her\nMajesty. It was in vain that Peel pleaded and argued; in vain that\nhe spoke, growing every moment more pompous and uneasy, of the\nconstitution, and Queens Regnant, and the public interest; in vain that\nhe danced his pathetic minuet. She was adamant; but he, too, through all\nhis embarrassment, showed no sign of yielding; and when at last he left\nher nothing had been decided--the whole formation of the Government was\nhanging in the wind. A frenzy of excitement now seized upon Victoria.\nSir Robert, she believed in her fury, had tried to outwit her, to take\nher friends from her, to impose his will upon her own; but that was\nnot all: she had suddenly perceived, while the poor man was moving so\nuneasily before her, the one thing that she was desperately longing\nfor--a loop-hole of escape. She seized a pen and dashed off a note to\nLord Melbourne.\n\"Sir Robert has behaved very ill,\" she wrote, \"he insisted on my giving\nup my Ladies, to which I replied that I never would consent, and I never\nsaw a man so frightened... I was calm but very decided, and I think\nyou would have been pleased to see my composure and great firmness;\nthe Queen of England will not submit to such trickery. Keep yourself in\nreadiness, for you may soon be wanted.\" Hardly had she finished when the\nDuke of Wellington was announced. \"Well, Ma'am,\" he said as he entered,\n\"I am very sorry to find there is a difficulty.\" \"Oh!\" she instantly\nreplied, \"he began it, not me.\" She felt that only one thing now was\nneeded: she must be firm. And firm she was. The venerable conqueror\nof Napoleon was outfaced by the relentless equanimity of a girl in her\nteens. He could not move the Queen one inch. At last, she even ventured\nto rally him. \"Is Sir Robert so weak,\" she asked, \"that even the Ladies\nmust be of his opinion?\" On which the Duke made a brief and humble\nexpostulation, bowed low, and departed.\nHad she won? Time would show; and in the meantime she scribbled down\nanother letter. \"Lord Melbourne must not think the Queen rash in her\nconduct... The Queen felt this was an attempt to see whether she could\nbe led and managed like a child.\"(*) The Tories were not only wicked but\nridiculous. Peel, having, as she understood, expressed a wish to remove\nonly those members of the Household who were in Parliament, now objected\nto her Ladies. \"I should like to know,\" she exclaimed in triumphant\nscorn, \"if they mean to give the Ladies seats in Parliament?\"\n(*) The exclamation \"They wished to treat me like a girl,\nbut I will show them that I am Queen of England!\" often\nquoted as the Queen's, is apocryphal. It is merely part of\nGreville's summary of the two letters to Melbourne. It may\nbe noted that the phrase \"the Queen of England will not\nsubmit to such trickery\" is omitted in \"Girlhood,\" and in\ngeneral there are numerous verbal discrepancies between the\nversions of the journal and the letters in the two books.\nThe end of the crisis was now fast approaching. Sir Robert returned, and\ntold her that if she insisted upon retaining all her Ladies he could\nnot form a Government. She replied that she would send him her final\ndecision in writing. Next morning the late Whig Cabinet met. Lord\nMelbourne read to them the Queen's letters, and the group of elderly\npoliticians were overcome by an extraordinary wave of enthusiasm. They\nknew very well that, to say the least, it was highly doubtful whether\nthe Queen had acted in strict accordance with the constitution; that in\ndoing what she had done she had brushed aside Lord Melbourne's advice;\nthat, in reality, there was no public reason whatever why they should\ngo back upon their decision to resign. But such considerations vanished\nbefore the passionate urgency of Victoria. The intensity of her\ndetermination swept them headlong down the stream of her desire. They\nunanimously felt that \"it was impossible to abandon such a Queen\nand such a woman.\" Forgetting that they were no longer her Majesty's\nMinisters, they took the unprecedented course of advising the Queen by\nletter to put an end to her negotiation with Sir Robert Peel. She did\nso; all was over; she had triumphed. That evening there was a ball at\nthe Palace. Everyone was present. \"Peel and the Duke of Wellington came\nby looking very much put out.\" She was perfectly happy; Lord M. was",

The domestic imbroglio continued unabated, until at last\nthe Duke, rejected as a Minister, was called in once again in his old\ncapacity as moral physician to the family. Something was accomplished\nwhen, at last, he induced Sir John Conroy to resign his place about the\nDuchess of Kent and leave the Palace for ever; something more when he\npersuaded the Queen to write an affectionate letter to her mother. The\nway seemed open for a reconciliation, but the Duchess was stormy still.\nShe didn't believe that Victoria had written that letter; it was not\nin her handwriting; and she sent for the Duke to tell him so. The Duke,\nassuring her that the letter was genuine, begged her to forget the past.\nBut that was not so easy. \"What am I to do if Lord Melbourne comes up to\nme?\" \"Do, ma'am? Why, receive him with civility.\" Well, she would make\nan effort... \"But what am I to do if Victoria asks me to shake hands\nwith Lehzen?\" \"Do, ma'am? Why, take her in your arms and kiss her.\"\n\"What!\" The Duchess bristled in every feather, and then she burst into\na hearty laugh. \"No, ma'am, no,\" said the Duke, laughing too. \"I don't\nmean you are to take Lehzen in your arms and kiss her, but the\nQueen.\" The Duke might perhaps have succeeded, had not all attempts at\nconciliation been rendered hopeless by a tragical event. Lady Flora,\nit was discovered, had been suffering from a terrible internal malady,\nwhich now grew rapidly worse. There could be little doubt that she was\ndying. The Queen's unpopularity reached an extraordinary height. More\nthan once she was publicly insulted. \"Mrs. Melbourne,\" was shouted at\nher when she appeared at her balcony; and, at Ascot, she was hissed\nby the Duchess of Montrose and Lady Sarah Ingestre as she passed. Lady\nFlora died. The whole scandal burst out again with redoubled vehemence;\nwhile, in the Palace, the two parties were henceforth divided by an\nimpassable, a Stygian, gulf.\nNevertheless, Lord M. was back, and every trouble faded under the\nenchantment of his presence and his conversation. He, on his side,\nhad gone through much; and his distresses were intensified by a\nconsciousness of his own shortcomings. He realised clearly enough that,\nif he had intervened at the right moment, the Hastings scandal might\nhave been averted; and, in the bedchamber crisis, he knew that he had\nallowed his judgment to be overruled and his conduct to be swayed by\nprivate feelings and the impetuosity of Victoria. But he was not one\nto suffer too acutely from the pangs of conscience. In spite of the\ndullness and the formality of the Court, his relationship with the\nQueen had come to be the dominating interest in his life; to have been\ndeprived of it would have been heartrending; that dread eventuality\nhad been--somehow--avoided; he was installed once more, in a kind of\ntriumph; let him enjoy the fleeting hours to the full!

      "text": "I\nIt was decidedly a family match. Prince Francis Charles Augustus Albert\nEmmanuel of Saxe-Coburg--Gotha--for such was his full title--had been\nborn just three months after his cousin Victoria, and the same midwife\nhad assisted at the two births. The children's grandmother, the Dowager\nDuchess of Coburg, had from the first looked forward to their marriage,\nas they grew up, the Duke, the Duchess of Kent, and King Leopold came\nequally to desire it. The Prince, ever since the time when, as a child\nof three, his nurse had told him that some day \"the little English May\nflower\" would be his wife, had never thought of marrying anyone else.\nWhen eventually Baron Stockmar himself signified his assent, the affair\nseemed as good as settled.\nThe Duke had one other child--Prince Ernest, Albert's senior by one\nyear, and heir to the principality. The Duchess was a sprightly and\nbeautiful woman, with fair hair and blue eyes; Albert was very like her\nand was her declared favourite. But in his fifth year he was parted from\nher for ever. The ducal court was not noted for the strictness of its\nmorals; the Duke was a man of gallantry, and it was rumoured that the\nDuchess followed her husband's example. There were scandals: one of the\nCourt Chamberlains, a charming and cultivated man of Jewish extraction,\nwas talked of; at last there was a separation, followed by a divorce.\nThe Duchess retired to Paris, and died unhappily in 1831. Her memory was\nalways very dear to Albert.\nHe grew up a pretty, clever, and high-spirited boy. Usually\nwell-behaved, he was, however, sometimes violent. He had a will of\nhis own, and asserted it; his elder brother was less passionate, less\npurposeful, and, in their wrangles, it was Albert who came out top. The\ntwo boys, living for the most part in one or other of the Duke's country\nhouses, among pretty hills and woods and streams, had been at a very\nearly age--Albert was less than four--separated from their nurses and\nput under a tutor, in whose charge they remained until they went to the\nUniversity. They were brought up in a simple and unostentatious manner,\nfor the Duke was poor and the duchy very small and very insignificant.\nBefore long it became evident that Albert was a model lad. Intelligent\nand painstaking, he had been touched by the moral earnestness of his\ngeneration; at the age of eleven he surprised his father by telling him\nthat he hoped to make himself \"a good and useful man.\" And yet he was\nnot over-serious; though, perhaps, he had little humour, he was full\nof fun--of practical jokes and mimicry. He was no milksop; he rode, and\nshot, and fenced; above all did he delight in being out of doors, and\nnever was he happier than in his long rambles with his brother through\nthe wild country round his beloved Rosenau--stalking the deer, admiring\nthe scenery, and returning laden with specimens for his natural\nhistory collection. He was, besides, passionately fond of music. In one\nparticular it was observed that he did not take after his father: owing\neither to his peculiar upbringing or to a more fundamental idiosyncrasy\nhe had a marked distaste for the opposite sex. At the age of five, at a\nchildren's dance, he screamed with disgust and anger when a little girl\nwas led up to him for a partner; and though, later on, he grew more\nsuccessful in disguising such feelings, the feelings remained.\nThe brothers were very popular in Coburg, and, when the time came for\nthem to be confirmed, the preliminary examination which, according to\nancient custom, was held in public in the \"Giants' Hall\" of the\nCastle, was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of functionaries, clergy,\ndelegates from the villages of the duchy, and miscellaneous onlookers.\nThere were also present, besides the Duke and the Dowager Duchess, their\nSerene Highnesses the Princes Alexander and Ernest of Wurtemberg,\nPrince Leiningen, Princess Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and Princess\nHohenlohe-Schillingsfurst. Dr. Jacobi, the Court chaplain, presided at\nan altar, simply but appropriately decorated, which had been placed at\nthe end of the hall; and the proceedings began by the choir singing the\nfirst verse of the hymn, \"Come, Holy Ghost.\" After some introductory\nremarks, Dr. Jacobi began the examination. \"The dignified and decorous\nbearing of the Princes,\" we are told in a contemporary account,\n\"their strict attention to the questions, the frankness, decision, and\ncorrectness of their answers, produced a deep impression on the numerous\nassembly. Nothing was more striking in their answers than the evidence\nthey gave of deep feeling and of inward strength of conviction. The\nquestions put by the examiner were not such as to be met by a simple\n'yes' or 'no.' They were carefully considered in order to give the\naudience a clear insight into the views and feelings of,the young\nprinces. One of the most touching moments was when the examiner asked\nthe hereditary prince whether he intended steadfastly to hold to the\nEvangelical Church, and the Prince answered not only 'Yes!' but added in\na clear and decided tone: 'I and my brother are firmly resolved ever\nto remain faithful to the acknowledged truth.' The examination having\nlasted an hour, Dr. Jacobi made some concluding observations, followed\nby a short prayer; the second and third verses of the opening hymn were\nsung; and the ceremony was over. The Princes, stepping down from the\naltar, were embraced by the Duke and the Dowager Duchess; after which\nthe loyal inhabitants of Coburg dispersed, well satisfied with their\nentertainment.\"",

      "text": "Albert's mental development now proceeded apace. In his seventeenth year\nhe began a careful study of German literature and German philosophy.\nHe set about, he told his tutor, \"to follow the thoughts of the great\nKlopstock into their depths--though in this, for the most part,\" he\nmodestly added, \"I do not succeed.\" He wrote an essay on the \"Mode\nof Thought of the Germans, and a Sketch of the History of German\nCivilisation,\" \"making use,\" he said, \"in its general outlines, of\nthe divisions which the treatment of the subject itself demands,\" and\nconcluding with \"a retrospect of the shortcomings of our time, with an\nappeal to every one to correct those shortcomings in his own case, and\nthus set a good example to others.\" Placed for some months under the\ncare of King Leopold at Brussels, he came under the influence of Adolphe\nQuetelet, a mathematical professor, who was particularly interested\nin the application of the laws of probability to political and moral\nphenomena; this line of inquiry attracted the Prince, and the friendship\nthus begun continued till the end of his life. From Brussels he went to\nthe University of Bonn, where he was speedily distinguished both by his\nintellectual and his social activities; his energies were absorbed\nin metaphysics, law, political economy, music, fencing, and amateur\ntheatricals. Thirty years later his fellow--students recalled with\ndelight the fits of laughter into which they had been sent by Prince\nAlbert's mimicry. The verve with which his Serene Highness reproduced\nthe tones and gestures of one of the professors who used to point to\na picture of a row of houses in Venice with the remark, \"That is the\nPonte-Realte,\" and of another who fell down in a race and was obliged to\nlook for his spectacles, was especially appreciated.\nAfter a year at Bonn, the time had come for a foreign tour, and Baron\nStockmar arrived from England to accompany the Prince on an expedition\nto Italy. The Baron had been already, two years previously, consulted\nby King Leopold as to his views upon the proposed marriage of Albert\nand Victoria. His reply had been remarkable. With a characteristic\nforesight, a characteristic absence of optimism, a characteristic sense\nof the moral elements in the situation, Stockmar had pointed out what\nwere, in his opinion, the conditions essential to make the marriage a\nsuccess. Albert, he wrote, \"was a fine young fellow, well grown for his\nage, with agreeable and valuable qualities; and it was probable that\nin a few years he would turn out a strong handsome man, of a kindly,\nsimple, yet dignified demeanour. Thus, externally, he possesses\nall that pleases the sex, and at all times and in all countries must\nplease.\" Supposing, therefore, that Victoria herself was in favour of\nthe marriage, the further question arose as to whether Albert's mental\nqualities were such as to fit him for the position of husband of the\nQueen of England. On this point, continued the Baron, one heard much to\nhis credit; the Prince was said to be discreet and intelligent; but\nall such judgments were necessarily partial, and the Baron preferred to\nreserve his opinion until he could come to a trustworthy conclusion from\npersonal observation. And then he added: \"But all this is not enough.\nThe young man ought to have not merely great ability, but a right\nambition, and great force of will as well. To pursue for a lifetime a\npolitical career so arduous demands more than energy and inclination--it\ndemands also that earnest frame of mind which is ready of its own accord\nto sacrifice mere pleasure to real usefulness. If he is not satisfied\nhereafter with the consciousness of having achieved one of the most\ninfluential positions in Europe, how often will he feel tempted to\nrepent his adventure! If he does not from the very outset accept it as a\nvocation of grave responsibility, on the efficient performance of\nwhich his honour and happiness depend, there is small likelihood of his\nsucceeding.\"\nSuch were the views of Stockmar on the qualifications necessary for the\ndue fulfilment of that destiny which Albert's family had marked out for\nhim; and he hoped, during the tour in Italy, to come to some conclusion\nas to how far the prince possessed them. Albert on his side was much",

He delighted in the galleries and scenery\nof Florence, though with Rome he was less impressed. \"But for some\nbeautiful palaces,\" he said, \"it might just as well be any town in\nGermany.\" In an interview with Pope Gregory XVI, he took the opportunity\nof displaying his erudition. When the Pope observed that the Greeks\nhad taken their art from the Etruscans, Albert replied that, on the\ncontrary, in his opinion, they had borrowed from the Egyptians: his\nHoliness politely acquiesced. Wherever he went he was eager to increase\nhis knowledge, and, at a ball in Florence, he was observed paying no\nattention whatever to the ladies, and deep in conversation with the\nlearned Signor Capponi. \"Voila un prince dont nous pouvons etre fiers,\"\nsaid the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who was standing by: \"la belle danseuse\nl'attend, le savant l'occupe.\"\nOn his return to Germany, Stockmar's observations, imparted to King\nLeopold, were still critical. Albert, he said, was intelligent,\nkind, and amiable; he was full of the best intentions and the noblest\nresolutions, and his judgment was in many things beyond his years. But\ngreat exertion was repugnant to him; he seemed to be too willing to\nspare himself, and his good resolutions too often came to nothing. It\nwas particularly unfortunate that he took not the slightest interest\nin politics, and never read a newspaper. In his manners, too, there was\nstill room for improvement. \"He will always,\" said the Baron, \"have more\nsuccess with men than with women, in whose society he shows too little\nempressement, and is too indifferent and retiring.\" One other feature\nof the case was noted by the keen eye of the old physician: the Prince's\nconstitution was not a strong one. Yet, on the whole, he was favourable\nto the projected marriage. But by now the chief obstacle seemed to lie\nin another quarter, Victoria was apparently determined to commit herself\nto nothing. And so it happened that when Albert went to England he had\nmade up his mind to withdraw entirely from the affair. Nothing would\ninduce him, he confessed to a friend, to be kept vaguely waiting;\nhe would break it all off at once. His reception at Windsor threw an",

      "text": "He was not in love with her. Affection, gratitude, the natural reactions\nto the unqualified devotion of a lively young cousin who was also\na queen--such feelings possessed him, but the ardours of reciprocal\npassion were not his. Though he found that he liked Victoria very much,\nwhat immediately interested him in his curious position was less her\nthan himself. Dazzled and delighted, riding, dancing, singing, laughing,\namid the splendours of Windsor, he was aware of a new sensation--the\nstirrings of ambition in his breast. His place would indeed be a high,\nan enviable one! And then, on the instant, came another thought. The\nteaching of religion, the admonitions of Stockmar, his own inmost\nconvictions, all spoke with the same utterance. He would not be there to\nplease himself, but for a very different purpose--to do good. He must be\n\"noble, manly, and princely in all things,\" he would have \"to live and\nto sacrifice himself for the benefit of his new country;\" to \"use his\npowers and endeavours for a great object--that of promoting the welfare\nof multitudes of his fellowmen.\" One serious thought led on to another.\nThe wealth and the bustle of the English Court might be delightful for\nthe moment, but, after all, it was Coburg that had his heart. \"While\nI shall be untiring,\" he wrote to his grandmother, \"in my efforts and\nlabours for the country to which I shall in future belong, and where\nI am called to so high a position, I shall never cease ein treuer\nDeutscher, Coburger, Gothaner zu sein.\" And now he must part from Coburg\nfor ever! Sobered and sad, he sought relief in his brother Ernest's\ncompany; the two young men would shut themselves up together, and,\nsitting down at the pianoforte, would escape from the present and the\nfuture in the sweet familiar gaiety of a Haydn duet.\nThey returned to Germany; and while Albert, for a few farewell months,\nenjoyed, for the last time, the happiness of home, Victoria, for the\nlast time, resumed her old life in London and Windsor. She corresponded\ndaily with her future husband in a mingled flow of German and English;\nbut the accustomed routine reasserted itself; the business and the\npleasures of the day would brook no interruption; Lord M. was once\nmore constantly beside her; and the Tories were as intolerable as ever.\nIndeed, they were more so. For now, in these final moments, the old feud\nburst out with redoubled fury. The impetuous sovereign found, to her\nchagrin, that there might be disadvantages in being the declared enemy\nof one of the great parties in the State. On two occasions, the Tories\ndirectly thwarted her in a matter on which she had set her heart. She\nwished her husband's rank to be axed by statute, and their opposition\nprevented it. She wished her husband to receive a settlement from the\nnation of L50,000 a year; and, again owing to the Tories, he was only\nallowed L30,000. It was too bad. When the question was discussed in\nParliament, it had been pointed out that the bulk of the population was\nsuffering from great poverty, and that L30,000 was the whole revenue of\nCoburg; but her uncle Leopold had been given L50,000, and it would\nbe monstrous to give Albert less. Sir Robert Peel--it might have been\nexpected--had had the effrontery to speak and vote for the smaller sum.\nShe was very angry; and determined to revenge herself by omitting to\ninvite a single Tory to her wedding. She would make an exception in\nfavour of old Lord Liverpool, but even the Duke of Wellington she\nrefused to ask. When it was represented to her that it would amount to\na national scandal if the Duke were absent from her wedding, she was\nangrier than ever. \"What! That old rebel! I won't have him:\" she\nwas reported to have said. Eventually she was induced to send him an\ninvitation; but she made no attempt to conceal the bitterness of her\nfeelings, and the Duke himself was only too well aware of all that had",

He\nwas whirled rapidly to his destiny. At Calais a steamboat awaited him,\nand, together with his father and his brother, he stepped, dejected, on\nboard. A little later, he was more dejected still.

      "text": "Albert had foreseen that his married life would not be all plain\nsailing; but he had by no means realised the gravity and the\ncomplication of the difficulties which he would have to face.\nPolitically, he was a cipher. Lord Melbourne was not only Prime\nMinister, he was in effect the Private Secretary of the Queen, and thus\ncontrolled the whole of the political existence of the sovereign. A\nqueen's husband was an entity unknown to the British Constitution. In\nState affairs there seemed to be no place for him; nor was Victoria\nherself at all unwilling that this should be so. \"The English,\" she had\ntold the Prince when, during their engagement, a proposal had been made\nto give him a peerage, \"are very jealous of any foreigner interfering in\nthe government of this country, and have already in some of the papers\nexpressed a hope that you would not interfere. Now, though I know you\nnever would, still, if you were a Peer, they would all say, the Prince\nmeant to play a political part. I know you never would!\" In reality, she\nwas not quite so certain; but she wished Albert to understand her views.\nHe would, she hoped, make a perfect husband; but, as for governing the\ncountry, he would see that she and Lord M. between them could manage\nthat very well, without his help.\nBut it was not only in politics that the Prince discovered that the part\ncut out for him was a negligible one. Even as a husband, he found, his\nfunctions were to be of an extremely limited kind. Over the whole of\nVictoria's private life the Baroness reigned supreme; and she had not\nthe slightest intention of allowing that supremacy to be diminished by\none iota. Since the accession, her power had greatly increased. Besides\nthe undefined and enormous influence which she exercised through her\nmanagement of the Queen's private correspondence, she was now the\nsuperintendent of the royal establishment and controlled the important\noffice of Privy Purse. Albert very soon perceived that he was not master\nin his own house. Every detail of his own and his wife's existence was\nsupervised by a third person: nothing could be done until the consent\nof Lehzen had first been obtained. And Victoria, who adored Lehzen with\nunabated intensity, saw nothing in all this that was wrong.\nNor was the Prince happier in his social surroundings. A shy young\nforeigner, awkward in ladies' company, unexpansive and self-opinionated,\nit was improbable that, in any circumstances, he would have been a\nsociety success. His appearance, too, was against him. Though in the\neyes of Victoria he was the mirror of manly beauty, her subjects, whose\neyes were of a less Teutonic cast, did not agree with her. To them--and\nparticularly to the high-born ladies and gentlemen who naturally saw him\nmost--what was immediately and distressingly striking in Albert's face\nand figure and whole demeanour was his un-English look. His features\nwere regular, no doubt, but there was something smooth and smug about\nthem; he was tall, but he was clumsily put together, and he walked with\na slight slouch. Really, they thought, this youth was more like\nsome kind of foreign tenor than anything else. These were serious\ndisadvantages; but the line of conduct which the Prince adopted from\nthe first moment of his arrival was far from calculated to dispel\nthem. Owing partly to a natural awkwardness, partly to a fear of undue\nfamiliarity, and partly to a desire to be absolutely correct, his\nmanners were infused with an extraordinary stiffness and formality.\nWhenever he appeared in company, he seemed to be surrounded by a thick\nhedge of prickly etiquette. He never went out into ordinary society; he\nnever walked in the streets of London; he was invariably accompanied by\nan equerry when he rode or drove. He wanted to be irreproachable and, if\nthat involved friendlessness, it could not be helped. Besides, he had no\nvery high opinion of the English. So far as he could see, they cared for\nnothing but fox-hunting and Sunday observances; they oscillated between\nan undue frivolity and an undue gloom; if you spoke to them of friendly\njoyousness they stared; and they did not understand either the Laws of\nThought or the wit of a German University. Since it was clear that with\nsuch people he could have very little in common, there was no reason\nwhatever for relaxing in their favour the rules of etiquette. In strict\nprivacy, he could be natural and charming; Seymour and Anson were\ndevoted to him, and he returned their affection; but they were\nsubordinates--the receivers of his confidences and the agents of his\nwill. From the support and the solace of true companionship he was\nutterly cut off.\nA friend, indeed, he had--or rather, a mentor. The Baron, established\nonce more in the royal residence, was determined to work with as\nwholehearted a detachment for the Prince's benefit as, more than twenty\nyears before, he had worked for his uncle's. The situations then and\nnow, similar in many respects, were yet full of differences. Perhaps in\neither case the difficulties to be encountered were equally great; but\nthe present problem was the more complex and the more interesting. The\nyoung doctor who, unknown and insignificant, had nothing at the back of\nhim but his own wits and the friendship of an unimportant Prince, had\nbeen replaced by the accomplished confidant of kings and ministers, ripe\nin years, in reputation, and in the wisdom of a vast experience. It\nwas possible for him to treat Albert with something of the affectionate\nauthority of a father; but, on the other hand, Albert was no Leopold.\nAs the Baron was very well aware, he had none of his uncle's rigidity of\nambition, none of his overweening impulse to be personally great. He was\nvirtuous and well-intentioned; he was clever and well-informed; but he\ntook no interest in politics, and there were no signs that he possessed\nany commanding force of character. Left to himself, he would almost\ncertainly have subsided into a high-minded nonentity, an aimless\ndilettante busy over culture, a palace appendage without influence or\npower.

Victoria, overcome by a new, an\nunimagined revelation, had surrendered her whole soul to her husband.\nThe beauty and the charm which so suddenly had made her his at first\nwere, she now saw, no more than but the outward manifestation of the\ntrue Albert. There was an inward beauty, an inward glory which, blind\nthat she was, she had then but dimly apprehended, but of which now she\nwas aware in every fibre of her being--he was good--he was great! How\ncould she ever have dreamt of setting up her will against his wisdom,\nher ignorance against his knowledge, her fancies against his perfect\ntaste? Had she really once loved London and late hours and dissipation?\nShe who now was only happy in the country, she who jumped out of bed\nevery morning--oh, so early!--with Albert, to take a walk, before\nbreakfast, with Albert alone! How wonderful it was to be taught by him!\nTo be told by him which trees were which; and to learn all about the\nbees! And then to sit doing cross-stitch while he read aloud to her\nHallam's Constitutional History of England! Or to listen to him playing\non his new organ 'The organ is the first of instruments,' he said; or\nto sing to him a song by Mendelssohn, with a great deal of care over\nthe time and the breathing, and only a very occasional false note! And,\nafter dinner, to--oh, how good of him! He had given up his double chess!\nAnd so there could be round games at the round table, or everyone could\nspend the evening in the most amusing way imaginable--spinning counters\nand rings.' When the babies came it was still more wonderful. Pussy was\nsuch a clever little girl (\"I am not Pussy! I am the Princess Royal!\"\nshe had angrily exclaimed on one occasion); and Bertie--well, she could\nonly pray MOST fervently that the little Prince of Wales would grow up\nto \"resemble his angelic dearest Father in EVERY, EVERY respect, both in\nbody and mind.\" Her dear Mamma, too, had been drawn once more into the\nfamily circle, for Albert had brought about a reconciliation, and the\ndeparture of Lehzen had helped to obliterate the past. In Victoria's\neyes, life had become an idyll, and, if the essential elements of an\nidyll are happiness, love and simplicity, an idyll it was; though,\nindeed, it was of a kind that might have disconcerted Theocritus.\n\"Albert brought in dearest little Pussy,\" wrote Her Majesty in her\njournal, \"in such a smart white merino dress trimmed with blue, which\nMamma had given her, and a pretty cap, and placed her on my bed,\nseating himself next to her, and she was very dear and good. And, as my\nprecious, invaluable Albert sat there, and our little Love between us, I\nfelt quite moved with happiness and gratitude to God.\"",

      "text": "Only one thing more was needed: material expression must be given to\nthe new ideals and the new forces so that they might stand revealed, in\nvisible glory, before the eyes of an astonished world. It was for Albert\nto supply this want. He mused, and was inspired: the Great Exhibition\ncame into his head.\nWithout consulting anyone, he thought out the details of his conception\nwith the minutest care. There had been exhibitions before in the world,\nbut this should surpass them all. It should contain specimens of\nwhat every country could produce in raw materials, in machinery and\nmechanical inventions, in manufactures, and in the applied and plastic\narts. It should not be merely useful and ornamental; it should teach\na high moral lesson. It should be an international monument to those\nsupreme blessings of civilisation--peace, progress, and prosperity. For\nsome time past the Prince had been devoting much of his attention to the\nproblems of commerce and industry. He had a taste for machinery of every\nkind, and his sharp eye had more than once detected, with the precision\nof an expert, a missing cog-wheel in some vast and complicated engine. A\nvisit to Liverpool, where he opened the Albert Dock, impressed upon his\nmind the immensity of modern industrial forces, though in a letter\nto Victoria describing his experiences, he was careful to retain his\ncustomary lightness of touch. \"As I write,\" he playfully remarked,\n\"you will be making your evening toilette, and not be ready in time for\ndinner. I must set about the same task, and not, let me hope, with the\nsame result... The loyalty and enthusiasm of the inhabitants are great;\nbut the heat is greater still. I am satisfied that if the population of\nLiverpool had been weighed this morning, and were to be weighed again\nnow, they would be found many degrees lighter. The docks are wonderful,\nand the mass of shipping incredible.\" In art and science he had been\ndeeply interested since boyhood; his reform of the household had put\nhis talent for organisation beyond a doubt; and thus from every point\nof view the Prince was well qualified for his task. Having matured his\nplans, he summoned a small committee and laid an outline of his scheme\nbefore it. The committee approved, and the great undertaking was set on\nfoot without delay.\nTwo years, however, passed before it was completed. For two years the\nPrince laboured with extraordinary and incessant energy. At first all\nwent smoothly. The leading manufacturers warmly took up the idea; the\ncolonies and the East India Company were sympathetic; the great foreign\nnations were eager to send in their contributions; the powerful support\nof Sir Robert Peel was obtained, and the use of a site in Hyde Park,\nselected by the Prince, was sanctioned by the Government. Out of 234\nplans for the exhibition building, the Prince chose that of Joseph\nPaxton, famous as a designer of gigantic conservatories; and the work\nwas on the point of being put in hand when a series of unexpected\ndifficulties arose. Opposition to the whole scheme, which had long been\nsmouldering in various quarters, suddenly burst forth. There was\nan outcry, headed by The Times, against the use of the park for the\nexhibition; for a moment it seemed as if the building would be relegated\nto a suburb; but, after a fierce debate in the House, the supporters\nof the site in the Park won the day. Then it appeared that the project\nlacked a sufficient financial backing; but this obstacle, too, was\nsurmounted, and eventually L200,000 was subscribed as a guarantee fund.\nThe enormous glass edifice rose higher and higher, covering acres and\nenclosing towering elm trees beneath its roof: and then the fury of\nits enemies reached a climax. The fashionable, the cautious, the\nProtectionists, the pious, all joined in the hue and cry. It was pointed\nout that the Exhibition would serve as a rallying point for all the\nruffians in England, for all the malcontents in Europe; and that on\nthe day of its opening there would certainly be a riot and probably a\nrevolution. It was asserted that the glass roof was porous, and that the\ndroppings of fifty million sparrows would utterly destroy every object\nbeneath it. Agitated nonconformists declared that the Exhibition was an\narrogant and wicked enterprise which would infallibly bring down God's\npunishment upon the nation. Colonel Sibthorpe, in the debate on the\nAddress, prayed that hail and lightning might descend from heaven on the\naccursed thing. The Prince, with unyielding perseverance and infinite\npatience, pressed on to his goal. His health was seriously affected; he\nsuffered from constant sleeplessness; his strength was almost worn out.\nBut he remembered the injunctions of Stockmar and never relaxed. The\nvolume of his labours grew more prodigious every day; he toiled at\ncommittees, presided over public meetings, made speeches, and carried on\ncommunications with every corner of the civilised world--and his efforts\nwere rewarded. On May 1, 1851, the Great Exhibition was opened by the\nQueen before an enormous concourse of persons, amid scenes of dazzling\nbrilliancy and triumphant enthusiasm.\nVictoria herself was in a state of excitement which bordered on\ndelirium. She performed her duties in a trance of joy, gratitude, and\namazement, and, when it was all over, her feelings poured themselves out\ninto her journal in a torrential flood. The day had been nothing but\nan endless succession of glories--or rather one vast glory--one vast\nradiation of Albert. Everything she had seen, everything she had felt\nor heard, had been so beautiful, so wonderful that even the royal\nunderlinings broke down under the burden of emphasis, while her\nremembering pen rushed on, regardless, from splendour to splendour--the\nhuge crowds, so well--behaved and loyal-flags of all the nations\nfloating--the inside of the building, so immense, with myriads of people\nand the sun shining through the roof--a little side room, where we left\nour shawls--palm-trees and machinery--dear Albert--the place so big\nthat we could hardly hear the organ--thankfulness to God--a curious\nassemblage of political and distinguished men--the March from\nAthalie--God bless my dearest Albert, God bless my dearest country!--a\nglass fountain--the Duke and Lord Anglesey walking arm in arm--a\nbeautiful Amazon, in bronze, by Kiss--Mr. Paxton, who might be justly\nproud, and rose from being a common gardener's boy--Sir George Grey in\ntears, and everybody astonished and delighted.\nA striking incident occurred when, after a short prayer by the\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the choir of 600 voices burst into the\n\"Hallelujah Chorus.\" At that moment a Chinaman, dressed in full national\ncostume, stepped out into the middle of the central nave, and, advancing\nslowly towards the royal group, did obeisance to Her Majesty. The Queen,\nmuch impressed, had no doubt that he was an eminent mandarin; and,\nwhen the final procession was formed, orders were given that, as\nno representative of the Celestial Empire was present, he should be\nincluded in the diplomatic cortege. He accordingly, with the utmost\ngravity, followed immediately behind the Ambassadors. He subsequently\ndisappeared, and it was rumoured, among ill-natured people, that, far\nfrom being a mandarin, the fellow was a mere impostor. But nobody ever\nreally discovered the nature of the comments that had been lurking\nbehind the matchless impassivity of that yellow face.\nA few days later Victoria poured out her heart to her uncle. The\nfirst of May, she said, was \"the GREATEST day in our history, the most\nBEAUTIFUL and IMPOSING and TOUCHING spectacle ever seen, and the triumph\nof my beloved Albert... It was the HAPPIEST, PROUDEST day in my life,\nand I can think of nothing else. Albert's dearest name is immortalised\nwith this GREAT conception, HIS own, and my OWN dear country SHOWED she\nwas WORTHY of it. The triumph is IMMENSE.\"\nIt was. The enthusiasm was universal; even the bitterest scoffers were\nconverted, and joined in the chorus of praise. Congratulations from\npublic bodies poured in; the City of Paris gave a great fete to the\nExhibition committee; and the Queen and the Prince made a triumphal\nprogress through the North of England. The financial results were\nequally remarkable. The total profit made by the Exhibition amounted to\na sum of L165,000, which was employed in the purchase of land for the\nerection of a permanent National Museum in South Kensington. During\nthe six months of its existence in Hyde Park over six million persons\nvisited it, and not a single accident occurred. But there is an end to\nall things; and the time had come for the Crystal Palace to be removed\nto the salubrious seclusion of Sydenham. Victoria, sad but resigned,\npaid her final visit. \"It looked so beautiful,\" she said. \"I could not\nbelieve it was the last time I was to see it. An organ, accompanied by\na fine and powerful wind instrument called the sommerophone, was being\nplayed, and it nearly upset me. The canvas is very dirty, the red\ncurtains are faded and many things are very much soiled, still the\neffect is fresh and new as ever and most beautiful. The glass fountain\nwas already removed... and the sappers and miners were rolling about\nthe little boxes just as they did at the beginning. It made us all very\nmelancholy.\" But more cheerful thoughts followed. When all was over,\nshe expressed her boundless satisfaction in a dithyrambic letter to\nthe Prime Minister. Her beloved husband's name, she said, was for ever\nimmortalised, and that this was universally recognised by the country\nwas a source to her of immense happiness and gratitude. \"She feels\ngrateful to Providence,\" Her Majesty concluded, \"to have permitted her\nto be united to so great, so noble, so excellent a Prince, and this year\nwill ever remain the proudest and happiest of her life. The day of the\nclosing of the Exhibition (which the Queen regretted much she could not\nwitness), was the twelfth anniversary of her betrothal to the Prince,\nwhich is a curious coincidence.\"",

      "text": "But Palmerston, busy with his plans, his ambitions, and the management\nof a great department, brushed all such considerations on one side; it\nwas his favourite method of action. He lived by instinct--by a quick eye\nand a strong hand, a dexterous management of every crisis as it arose, a\nhalf-unconscious sense of the vital elements in a situation. He was very\nbold; and nothing gave him more exhilaration than to steer the ship of\nstate in a high wind, on a rough sea, with every stitch of canvas on her\nthat she could carry. But there is a point beyond which boldness becomes\nrashness--a point perceptible only to intuition and not to reason;\nand beyond that point Palmerston never went. When he saw that the cast\ndemanded it, he could go slow--very slow indeed in fact, his whole\ncareer, so full of vigorous adventure, was nevertheless a masterly\nexample of the proverb, \"tout vient a point a qui sait attendre.\" But\nwhen he decided to go quick, nobody went quicker. One day, returning\nfrom Osborne, he found that he had missed the train to London; he\nordered a special, but the station master told him that to put a special\ntrain upon the line at that time of day would be dangerous and he\ncould not allow it. Palmerston insisted declaring that he had important\nbusiness in London, which could not wait. The station-master supported\nby all the officials, continued to demur the company, he said, could\nnot possibly take the responsibility. \"On MY responsibility, then!\" said\nPalmerston, in his off-hand, peremptory way whereupon the station-master\nordered up the train and the Foreign Secretary reached London in time\nfor his work, without an accident. The story, is typical of the happy\nvaliance with which he conducted both his own affairs and those of\nthe nation. \"England,\" he used to say, \"is strong enough to brave\nconsequences.\" Apparently, under Palmerston's guidance, she was. While\nthe officials protested and shook in their shoes, he would wave them\naway with his airy \"MY responsibility!\" and carry the country swiftly\nalong the line of his choice, to a triumphant destination--without an\naccident. His immense popularity was the result partly of his diplomatic\nsuccesses, partly of his extraordinary personal affability, but chiefly\nof the genuine intensity with which he responded to the feelings and\nsupported the interests of his countrymen. The public knew that it had\nin Lord Palmerston not only a high-mettled master, but also a devoted\nservant--that he was, in every sense of the word, a public man. When he\nwas Prime Minister, he noticed that iron hurdles had been put up on\nthe grass in the Green Park; he immediately wrote to the Minister\nresponsible, ordering, in the severest language, their instant removal,\ndeclaring that they were \"an intolerable nuisance,\" and that the purpose\nof the grass was \"to be walked upon freely and without restraint by the\npeople, old and young, for whose enjoyment the parks are maintained.\"\nIt was in this spirit that, as Foreign Secretary, he watched over the\ninterests of Englishmen abroad. Nothing could be more agreeable for\nEnglishmen; but foreign governments were less pleased. They found Lord\nPalmerston interfering, exasperating, and alarming. In Paris they spoke\nwith bated breath of \"ce terrible milord Palmerston;\" and in Germany\nthey made a little song about him--\n\"Hat der Teufel einen Sohn,\nSo ist er sicher Palmerston.\"\nBut their complaints, their threats, and their agitations were all\nin vain. Palmerston, with his upper lip sardonically curving, braved\nconsequences, and held on his course.",

For\nsome years past a curious problem had been perplexing the chanceries\nof Europe. Spain, ever since the time of Napoleon a prey to civil\nconvulsions, had settled down for a short interval to a state of\ncomparative quiet under the rule of Christina, the Queen Mother, and her\ndaughter Isabella, the young Queen. In 1846, the question of\nIsabella's marriage, which had for long been the subject of diplomatic\nspeculations, suddenly became acute. Various candidates for her hand\nwere proposed--among others, two cousins of her own, another Spanish\nprince, and Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, a first cousin of Victoria's\nand Albert's; for different reasons, however, none of these young men\nseemed altogether satisfactory. Isabella was not yet sixteen; and it\nmight have been supposed that her marriage could be put off for a few\nyears more; but this was considered to be out of the question. \"Vous\nne savez pas,\" said a high authority, \"ce que c'est que ces princesses\nespagnoles; elles ont le diable au corps, et on a toujours dit que si\nnous ne nous hations pas, l'heritier viendrait avant le mari.\" It might\nalso have been supposed that the young Queen's marriage was a matter to\nbe settled by herself, her mother, and the Spanish Government; but\nthis again was far from being the case. It had become, by one of those\nperiodical reversions to the ways of the eighteenth century, which,\nit is rumoured, are still not unknown in diplomacy, a question of\ndominating importance in the foreign policies both of France and\nEngland. For several years, Louis Philippe and his Prime Minister Guizot\nhad been privately maturing a very subtle plan. It was the object of the\nFrench King to repeat the glorious coup of Louis XIV, and to abolish\nthe Pyrenees by placing one of his grandsons on the throne of Spain.\nIn order to bring this about, he did not venture to suggest that his\nyounger son, the Duc de Montpensier, should marry Isabella; that would\nhave been too obvious a move, which would have raised immediate and\ninsurmountable opposition. He therefore proposed that Isabella\nshould marry her cousin, the Duke of Cadiz, while Montpensier married\nIsabella's younger sister, the Infanta Fernanda; and pray, what possible\nobjection could there be to that? The wily old King whispered into\nthe chaste ears of Guizot the key to the secret; he had good reason to\nbelieve that the Duke of Cadiz was incapable of having children, and\ntherefore the offspring of Fernanda would inherit the Spanish crown.\nGuizot rubbed his hands, and began at once to set the necessary springs\nin motion; but, of course, the whole scheme was very soon divulged and\nunderstood. The English Government took an extremely serious view of\nthe matter; the balance of power was clearly at stake, and the French\nintrigue must be frustrated at all hazards. A diplomatic struggle of\ngreat intensity followed; and it occasionally appeared that a second War\nof the Spanish Succession was about to break out. This was avoided,\nbut the consequences of this strange imbroglio were far-reaching and\ncompletely different from what any of the parties concerned could have",

The ruin which had fallen upon the\nHouse of Coburg during the Napoleonic wars had apparently only served\nto multiply its vitality, for that princely family had by now extended\nitself over Europe in an extraordinary manner. King Leopold was firmly\nfixed in Belgium; his niece was Queen of England; one of his nephews\nwas the husband of the Queen of England, and another the husband of the\nQueen of Portugal; yet another was Duke of Wurtemberg. Where was this\nto end? There seemed to be a Coburg Trust ready to send out one of\nits members at any moment to fill up any vacant place among the ruling\nfamilies of Europe. And even beyond Europe there were signs of this\ninfection spreading. An American who had arrived in Brussels had assured\nKing Leopold that there was a strong feeling in the United States in\nfavour of monarchy instead of the misrule of mobs, and had suggested, to\nthe delight of His Majesty, that some branch of the Coburg family might\nbe available for the position. That danger might, perhaps, be remote;\nbut the Spanish danger was close at hand; and if Prince Leopold were to\nmarry Queen Isabella the position of France would be one of humiliation,\nif not of positive danger. Such were the asseverations of Louis\nPhilippe.

In that year of\nrevolutions, when, in all directions and with alarming frequency, crowns\nkept rolling off royal heads, Albert and Victoria were appalled to find\nthat the policy of England was persistently directed--in Germany,\nin Switzerland, in Austria, in Italy, in Sicily--so as to favour the\ninsurgent forces. The situation, indeed, was just such a one as the soul\nof Palmerston loved. There was danger and excitement, the necessity\nof decision, the opportunity for action, on every hand. A disciple of\nCanning, with an English gentleman's contempt and dislike of foreign\npotentates deep in his heart, the spectacle of the popular uprisings,\nand of the oppressors bundled ignominiously out of the palaces they had\ndisgraced, gave him unbounded pleasure, and he was determined that there\nshould be no doubt whatever, all over the Continent, on which side in\nthe great struggle England stood. It was not that he had the slightest\ntincture in him of philosophical radicalism; he had no philosophical\ntinctures of any kind; he was quite content to be inconsistent--to be a\nConservative at home and a Liberal abroad. There were very good reasons\nfor keeping the Irish in their places; but what had that to do with it?\nThe point was this--when any decent man read an account of the political\nprisons in Naples his gorge rose. He did not want war; but he saw that\nwithout war a skilful and determined use of England's power might do\nmuch to further the cause of the Liberals in Europe. It was a difficult\nand a hazardous game to play, but he set about playing it with delighted\nalacrity. And then, to his intense annoyance, just as he needed all\nhis nerve and all possible freedom of action, he found himself being\nhampered and distracted at every turn by... those people at Osborne.\nHe saw what it was; the opposition was systematic and informed, and\nthe Queen alone would have been incapable of it; the Prince was at the\nbottom of the whole thing. It was exceedingly vexatious; but Palmerston\nwas in a hurry, and could not wait; the Prince, if he would insist upon\ninterfering, must be brushed on one side.\nAlbert was very angry. He highly disapproved both of Palmerston's policy\nand of his methods of action. He was opposed to absolutism; but in his\nopinion Palmerston's proceedings were simply calculated to substitute\nfor absolutism, all over Europe, something no better and very possibly\nworse--the anarchy of faction and mob violence.

In Albert's eyes Palmerston was a coarse,\nreckless egotist, whose combined arrogance and ignorance must\ninevitably have their issue in folly and disaster. Nothing could be more\nantipathetic to him than a mind so strangely lacking in patience, in\nreflection, in principle, and in the habits of ratiocination. For to him\nit was intolerable to think in a hurry, to jump to slapdash decisions,\nto act on instincts that could not be explained. Everything must be done\nin due order, with careful premeditation; the premises of the position\nmust first be firmly established; and he must reach the correct\nconclusion by a regular series of rational steps. In complicated\nquestions--and what questions, rightly looked at, were not\ncomplicated?--to commit one's thoughts to paper was the wisest course,\nand it was the course which Albert, laborious though it might be,\ninvariably adopted. It was as well, too, to draw up a reasoned statement\nafter an event, as well as before it; and accordingly, whatever\nhappened, it was always found that the Prince had made a memorandum.\nOn one occasion he reduced to six pages of foolscap the substance of a\nconfidential conversation with Sir Robert Peel, and, having read them\naloud to him, asked him to append his signature; Sir Robert, who never\nliked to commit himself, became extremely uneasy; upon which the\nPrince, understanding that it was necessary to humour the singular\nsusceptibilities of Englishmen, with great tact dropped that particular\nmemorandum into the fire. But as for Palmerston, he never even gave one\nso much as a chance to read him a memorandum, he positively seemed to\ndislike discussion; and, before one knew where one was, without any\nwarning whatever, he would plunge into some hare-brained, violent\nproject, which, as likely as not, would logically involve a European\nwar. Closely connected, too, with this cautious, painstaking\nreasonableness of Albert's, was his desire to examine questions\nthoroughly from every point of view, to go down to the roots of things,\nand to act in strict accordance with some well-defined principle. Under\nStockmar's tutelage he was constantly engaged in enlarging his outlook\nand in endeavouring to envisage vital problems both theoretically and\npractically--both with precision and with depth. To one whose mind was\nthus habitually occupied, the empirical activities of Palmerston, who\nhad no notion what a principle meant, resembled the incoherent vagaries\nof a tiresome child. What did Palmerston know of economics, of science,\nof history? What did he care for morality and education? How much",

      "text": "\"brushing on one side\" very soon came into operation. Important Foreign\nOffice despatches were either submitted to the Queen so late that there\nwas no time to correct them, or they were not submitted to her at all;\nor, having been submitted, and some passage in them being objected\nto and an alteration suggested, they were after all sent off in their\noriginal form. The Queen complained, the Prince complained: both\ncomplained together. It was quite useless. Palmerston was most\napologetic--could not understand how it had occurred--must give the\nclerks a wigging--certainly Her Majesty's wishes should be attended to,\nand such a thing should never happen again. But, of course, it very soon\nhappened again, and the royal remonstrances redoubled. Victoria, her\npartisan passions thoroughly aroused, imported into her protests a\npersonal vehemence which those of Albert lacked. Did Lord Palmerston\nforget that she was Queen of England? How could she tolerate a state of\naffairs in which despatches written in her name were sent abroad without\nher approval or even her knowledge? What could be more derogatory to\nher position than to be obliged to receive indignant letters from the\ncrowned heads to whom those despatches were addressed--letters which she\ndid not know how to answer, since she so thoroughly agreed with them?\nShe addressed herself to the Prime Minister. \"No remonstrance has any\neffect with Lord Palmerston,\" she said. \"Lord Palmerston,\" she told him\non another occasion, \"has as usual pretended not to have had time to\nsubmit the draft to the Queen before he had sent it off.\" She summoned\nLord John to her presence, poured out her indignation, and afterwards,\non the advice of Albert, noted down what had passed in a memorandum: \"I\nsaid that I thought that Lord Palmerston often endangered the honour of\nEngland by taking a very prejudiced and one-sided view of a question;\nthat his writings were always as bitter as gall and did great harm,\nwhich Lord John entirely assented to, and that I often felt quite ill\nfrom anxiety.\" Then she turned to her uncle. \"The state of Germany,\"\nshe wrote in a comprehensive and despairing review of the European\nsituation, \"is dreadful, and one does feel quite ashamed about that once\nreally so peaceful and happy country. That there are still good people\nthere I am sure, but they allow themselves to be worked upon in a\nfrightful and shameful way. In France a crisis seems at hand. WHAT a\nvery bad figure we cut in this mediation! Really it is quite immoral,\nwith Ireland quivering in our grasp and ready to throw off her\nallegiance at any moment, for us to force Austria to give up her lawful\npossessions. What shall we say if Canada, Malta, etc., begin to trouble\nus? It hurts me terribly.\" But what did Lord Palmerston care?\nLord John's position grew more and more irksome. He did not approve of\nhis colleague's treatment of the Queen. When he begged him to be more\ncareful, he was met with the reply that 28,000 despatches passed through\nthe Foreign Office in a single year, that, if every one of these were\nto be subjected to the royal criticism, the delay would be most serious,\nthat, as it was, the waste of time and the worry involved in submitting\ndrafts to the meticulous examination of Prince Albert was almost too\nmuch for an overworked Minister, and that, as a matter of fact, the\npostponement of important decisions owing to this cause had already\nproduced very unpleasant diplomatic consequences. These excuses would\nhave impressed Lord John more favourably if he had not himself had to\nsuffer from a similar neglect. As often as not Palmerston failed to\ncommunicate even to him the most important despatches. The Foreign\nSecretary was becoming an almost independent power, acting on his own\ninitiative, and swaying the policy of England on his own responsibility.\nOn one occasion, in 1847, he had actually been upon the point of\nthreatening to break off diplomatic relations with France without\nconsulting either the Cabinet or the Prime Minister. And such incidents\nwere constantly recurring. When this became known to the Prince, he saw\nthat his opportunity had come. If he could only drive in to the utmost\nthe wedge between the two statesmen, if he could only secure the\nalliance of Lord John, then the suppression or the removal of Lord\nPalmerston would be almost certain to follow. He set about the business\nwith all the pertinacity of his nature. Both he and the Queen put every\nkind of pressure upon the Prime Minister. They wrote, they harangued,\nthey relapsed into awful silence. It occurred to them that Lord\nClarendon, an important member of the Cabinet, would be a useful\nchannel for their griefs. They commanded him to dine at the Palace, and,\ndirectly the meal was over, \"the Queen,\" as he described it afterwards,\n\"exploded, and went with the utmost vehemence and bitterness into the\nwhole of Palmerston's conduct, all the effects produced all over the\nworld, and all her own feelings and sentiments about it.\" When she had\nfinished, the Prince took up the tale, with less excitement, but with\nequal force. Lord Clarendon found himself in an awkward situation;\nhe disliked Palmerston's policy, but he was his colleague, and he\ndisapproved of the attitude of his royal hosts. In his opinion, they\nwere \"wrong in wishing that courtiers rather than Ministers should\nconduct the affairs of the country,\" and he thought that they \"laboured\nunder the curious mistake that the Foreign Office was their peculiar\ndepartment, and that they had the right to control, if not to direct,\nthe foreign policy of England.\" He, therefore, with extreme politeness,\ngave it to be understood that he would not commit himself in any\nway. But Lord John, in reality, needed no pressure. Attacked by his\nSovereign, ignored by his Foreign Secretary, he led a miserable life.\nWith the advent of the dreadful Schleswig-Holstein question--the most\ncomplex in the whole diplomatic history of Europe--his position,\ncrushed between the upper and the nether mill-stones, grew positively\nunbearable. He became anxious above all things to get Palmerston out of\nthe Foreign Office. But then--supposing Palmerston refused to go?\nIn a memorandum made by the Prince, at about this time, of an interview\nbetween himself, the Queen, and the Prime Minister, we catch a curious\nglimpse of the states of mind of those three high personages--the\nanxiety and irritation of Lord John, the vehement acrimony of Victoria,\nand the reasonable animosity of Albert--drawn together, as it were,\nunder the shadow of an unseen Presence, the cause of that celestial\nanger--the gay, portentous Palmerston. At one point in the conversation\nLord John observed that he believed the Foreign Secretary would consent\nto a change of offices; Lord Palmerston, he said, realised that he had\nlost the Queen's confidence--though only on public, and not on personal,\ngrounds. But on that, the Prince noted, \"the Queen interrupted Lord John\nby remarking that she distrusted him on PERSONAL grounds also, but I\nremarked that Lord Palmerston had so far at least seen rightly; that he\nhad become disagreeable to the Queen, not on account of his person, but\nof his political doings--to which the Queen assented.\" Then the Prince\nsuggested that there was a danger of the Cabinet breaking up, and of\nLord Palmerston returning to office as Prime Minister. But on that point\nLord John was reassuring: he \"thought Lord Palmerston too old to do much\nin the future (having passed his sixty-fifth year).\" Eventually it was\ndecided that nothing could be done for the present, but that the UTMOST\nSECRECY must be observed; and so the conclave ended.\nAt last, in 1850, deliverance seemed to be at hand. There were signs\nthat the public were growing weary of the alarums and excursions of\nPalmerston's diplomacy; and when his support of Don Pacifico, a British\nsubject, in a quarrel with the Greek Government, seemed to be upon the\npoint of involving the country in a war not only with Greece but also\nwith France, and possibly with Russia into the bargain, a heavy cloud\nof distrust and displeasure appeared to be gathering and about to burst\nover his head. A motion directed against him in the House of Lords was\npassed by a substantial majority. The question was next to be discussed\nin the House of Commons, where another adverse vote was not improbable,\nand would seal the doom of the Minister. Palmerston received the attack\nwith complete nonchalance, and then, at the last possible moment, he\nstruck. In a speech of over four hours, in which exposition, invective,\nargument, declamation, plain talk and resounding eloquence were mingled\ntogether with consummate art and extraordinary felicity, he annihilated\nhis enemies. The hostile motion was defeated, and Palmerston was once\nmore the hero of the hour. Simultaneously, Atropos herself conspired\nto favour him. Sir Robert Peel was thrown from his horse and killed. By\nthis tragic chance, Palmerston saw the one rival great enough to cope\nwith him removed from his path. He judged--and judged rightly--that\nhe was the most popular man in England; and when Lord John revived the\nproject of his exchanging the Foreign Office for some other position in\nthe Cabinet, he absolutely refused to stir.\nGreat was the disappointment of Albert; great was the indignation\nof Victoria. \"The House of Commons,\" she wrote, \"is becoming very\nunmanageable and troublesome.\" The Prince, perceiving that Palmerston\nwas more firmly fixed in the saddle than ever, decided that something\ndrastic must be done. Five months before, the prescient Baron had\ndrawn up, in case of emergency, a memorandum, which had been carefully\ndocketed, and placed in a pigeon-hole ready to hand. The emergency had\nnow arisen, and the memorandum must be used. The Queen copied out the\nwords of Stockmar, and sent them to the Prime Minister, requesting him\nto show her letter to Palmerston. \"She thinks it right,\" she wrote, \"in\norder TO PREVENT ANY MISTAKE for the FUTURE, shortly to explain WHAT\nIT IS SHE EXPECTS FROM HER FOREIGN SECRETARY. She requires: (1) That he\nwill distinctly state what he proposes in a given case, in order\nthat the Queen may know as distinctly to WHAT she has given her Royal\nsanction; (2) Having ONCE GIVEN her sanction to a measure, that it be\nnot arbitrarily altered or modified by the Minister; such an act she\nmust consider as failing in sincerity towards the Crown, and justly to\nbe visited by the exercise of her Constitutional right of dismissing\nthat Minister.\" Lord John Russell did as he was bid, and forwarded the\nQueen's letter to Lord Palmerston. This transaction, which was of grave\nconstitutional significance, was entirely unknown to the outside world.\nIf Palmerston had been a sensitive man, he would probably have resigned\non the receipt of the Queen's missive. But he was far from sensitive; he\nloved power, and his power was greater than ever; an unerring instinct\ntold him that this was not the time to go. Nevertheless, he was\nseriously perturbed. He understood at last that he was struggling with\na formidable adversary, whose skill and strength, unless they were\nmollified, might do irreparable injury to his career. He therefore wrote\nto Lord John, briefly acquiescing in the Queen's requirements--\"I have\ntaken a copy of this memorandum of the Queen and will not fail to attend\nto the directions which it contains\"--and at the same time, he asked for\nan interview with the Prince. Albert at once summoned him to the Palace,\nand was astonished to observe, as he noted in a memorandum, that when\nPalmerston entered the room \"he was very much agitated, shook, and\nhad tears in his eyes, so as quite to move me, who never under any\ncircumstances had known him otherwise than with a bland smile on his\nface.\" The old statesman was profuse in protestations and excuses; the\nyoung one was coldly polite. At last, after a long and inconclusive\nconversation, the Prince, drawing himself up, said that, in order to\ngive Lord Palmerston \"an example of what the Queen wanted,\" he would\n\"ask him a question point-blank.\" Lord Palmerston waited in respectful\nsilence, while the Prince proceeded as follows: \"You are aware that the\nQueen has objected to the Protocol about Schleswig, and of the grounds\non which she has done so. Her opinion has been overruled, the Protocol\nstating the desire of the Great Powers to see the integrity of the\nDanish monarchy preserved has been signed, and upon this the King of\nDenmark has invaded Schleswig, where the war is raging. If Holstein is\nattacked also, which is likely, the Germans will not be restrained from\nflying to her assistance; Russia has menaced to interfere with arms,\nif the Schleswigers are successful. What will you do, if this emergency\narises (provoking most likely an European war), and which will arise\nvery probably when we shall be at Balmoral and Lord John in another\npart of Scotland? The Queen expects from your foresight that you have\ncontemplated this possibility, and requires a categorical answer as\nto what you would do in the event supposed.\" Strangely enough, to this\npointblank question, the Foreign Secretary appeared to be unable to\nreply. The whole matter, he said, was extremely complicated, and the\ncontingencies mentioned by His Royal Highness were very unlikely to\narise. The Prince persisted; but it was useless; for a full hour he\nstruggled to extract a categorical answer, until at length Palmerston\nbowed himself out of the room. Albert threw up his hands in shocked\namazement: what could one do with such a man?\nWhat indeed? For, in spite of all his apologies and all his promises,\nwithin a few weeks the incorrigible reprobate was at his tricks again.\nThe Austrian General Haynau, notorious as a rigorous suppressor of\nrebellion in Hungary and Italy, and in particular as a flogger of women,\ncame to England and took it into his head to pay a visit to Messrs.\nBarclay and Perkins's brewery. The features of \"General Hyena,\" as he\nwas everywhere called--his grim thin face, his enormous pepper-and-salt\nmoustaches--had gained a horrid celebrity; and it so happened that among\nthe clerks at the brewery there was a refugee from Vienna, who had\ngiven his fellow-workers a first-hand account of the General's\ncharacteristics. The Austrian Ambassador, scenting danger, begged his\nfriend not to appear in public, or, if he must do so, to cut off his\nmoustaches first. But the General would take no advice. He went to the\nbrewery, was immediately recognised, surrounded by a crowd of angry\ndraymen, pushed about, shouted at, punched in the ribs, and pulled by\nthe moustaches until, bolting down an alley with the mob at his heels\nbrandishing brooms and roaring \"Hyena!\" he managed to take refuge in\na public house, whence he was removed under the protection of several\npolicemen. The Austrian Government was angry and demanded explanations.\nPalmerston, who, of course, was privately delighted by the incident,\nreplied regretting what had occurred, but adding that in his opinion\nthe General had \"evinced a want of propriety in coming to England at\nthe present moment;\" and he delivered his note to the Ambassador without\nhaving previously submitted it to the Queen or to the Prime Minister.\nNaturally, when this was discovered, there was a serious storm. The\nPrince was especially indignant; the conduct of the draymen he regarded,\nwith disgust and alarm, as \"a slight foretaste of what an unregulated\nmass of illiterate people is capable;\" and Palmerston was requested by\nLord John to withdraw his note, and to substitute for it another from\nwhich all censure of the General had been omitted. On this the Foreign\nSecretary threatened resignation, but the Prime Minister was firm. For a\nmoment the royal hopes rose high, only to be dashed to the ground again\nby the cruel compliance of the enemy. Palmerston, suddenly lamblike,\nagreed to everything; the note was withdrawn and altered, and peace was\npatched up once more.",

      "text": "December 2, Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat took place in Paris; and on\nthe following day Palmerston, without consulting anybody, expressed in a\nconversation with the French Ambassador his approval of Napoleon's act.\nTwo days later, he was instructed by the Prime Minister, in accordance\nwith a letter from the Queen, that it was the policy of the English\nGovernment to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality towards the\naffairs of France. Nevertheless, in an official despatch to the British\nAmbassador in Paris, he repeated the approval of the coup d'etat which\nhe had already given verbally to the French Ambassador in London. This\ndespatch was submitted neither to the Queen nor to the Prime Minister.\nLord John's patience, as he himself said, \"was drained to the last\ndrop.\" He dismissed Lord Palmerston.\nVictoria was in ecstasies; and Albert knew that the triumph was his even\nmore than Lord John's. It was his wish that Lord Granville, a young man\nwhom he believed to be pliant to his influence, should be Palmerston's\nsuccessor; and Lord Granville was appointed. Henceforward, it seemed\nthat the Prince would have his way in foreign affairs. After years of\nstruggle and mortification, success greeted him on every hand. In his\nfamily, he was an adored master; in the country, the Great Exhibition\nhad brought him respect and glory; and now in the secret seats of power\nhe had gained a new supremacy. He had wrestled with the terrible Lord\nPalmerston, the embodiment of all that was most hostile to him in the\nspirit of England, and his redoubtable opponent had been overthrown. Was\nEngland herself at his feet? It might be so; and yet... it is said that\nthe sons of England have a certain tiresome quality: they never know\nwhen they are beaten. It was odd, but Palmerston was positively still\njaunty. Was it possible? Could he believe, in his blind arrogance,\nthat even his ignominious dismissal from office was something that could\nbe brushed aside?\nIII\nThe Prince's triumph was short-lived. A few weeks later, owing to\nPalmerston's influence, the Government was defeated in the House, and\nLord John resigned. Then, after a short interval, a coalition between\nthe Whigs and the followers of Peel came into power, under the\npremiership of Lord Aberdeen. Once more, Palmerston was in the Cabinet.\nIt was true that he did not return to the Foreign Office; that was\nsomething to the good; in the Home Department it might be hoped that\nhis activities would be less dangerous and disagreeable. But the Foreign\nSecretary was no longer the complacent Granville; and in Lord Clarendon\nthe Prince knew that he had a Minister to deal with, who, discreet and\ncourteous as he was, had a mind of his own. These changes, however, were\nmerely the preliminaries of a far more serious development.\nEvents, on every side, were moving towards a catastrophe. Suddenly the\nnation found itself under the awful shadow of imminent war. For several\nmonths, amid the shifting mysteries of diplomacy and the perplexed\nagitations of politics, the issue grew more doubtful and more dark,\nwhile the national temper was strained to the breaking-point. At the\nvery crisis of the long and ominous negotiations, it was announced that\nLord Palmerston had resigned. Then the pent-up fury of the people burst\nforth. They had felt that in the terrible complexity of events they\nwere being guided by weak and embarrassed counsels; but they had been\nreassured by the knowledge that at the centre of power there was one man\nwith strength, with courage, with determination, in whom they could put\ntheir trust. They now learnt that that man was no longer among their\nleaders. Why? In their rage, anxiety, and nervous exhaustion, they\nlooked round desperately for some hidden and horrible explanation of\nwhat had occurred. They suspected plots, they smelt treachery in the\nair. It was easy to guess the object upon which their frenzy would\nvent itself. Was there not a foreigner in the highest of high places, a\nforeigner whose hostility to their own adored champion was unrelenting\nand unconcealed? The moment that Palmerston's resignation was known,\nthere was a universal outcry and an extraordinary tempest of anger and\nhatred burst, with unparalleled violence, upon the head of the Prince.",

The day,\nthus begun, continued in unremitting industry. At breakfast, the\nnewspapers--the once hated newspapers--made their appearance, and the\nPrince, absorbed in their perusal, would answer no questions, or, if\nan article struck him, would read it aloud. After, that there were\nministers and secretaries to interview; there was a vast correspondence\nto be carried on; there were numerous memoranda to be made. Victoria,\ntreasuring every word, preserving every letter, was all breathless\nattention and eager obedience. Sometimes Albert would actually ask her\nadvice.

I should\nthink this would do.\"\nThe important and exacting business of government, which became at last\nthe dominating preoccupation in Albert's mind, still left unimpaired\nhis old tastes and interests; he remained devoted to art, to science,\nto philosophy, and a multitude of subsidiary activities showed how his\nenergies increased as the demands upon them grew. For whenever duty\ncalled, the Prince was all alertness. With indefatigable perseverance he\nopened museums, laid the foundation stones of hospitals, made speeches\nto the Royal Agricultural Society, and attended meetings of the British\nAssociation. The National Gallery particularly interested him: he drew\nup careful regulations for the arrangement of the pictures according to\nschools; and he attempted--though in vain--to have the whole collection\ntransported to South Kensington. Feodora, now the Princess Hohenlohe,\nafter a visit to England, expressed in a letter to Victoria her\nadmiration of Albert both as a private and a public character. Nor did\nshe rely only on her own opinion. \"I must just copy out,\" she said,\n\"what Mr. Klumpp wrote to me some little time ago, and which is\nquite true--'Prince Albert is one of the few Royal personages who can\nsacrifice to any principle (as soon as it has become evident to them to\nbe good and noble) all those notions (or sentiments) to which others,\nowing to their narrow-mindedness, or to the prejudices of their rank,\nare so thoroughly inclined strongly to cling.' There is something so\ntruly religious in this,\" the Princess added, \"as well as humane and\njust, most soothing to my feelings which are so often hurt and disturbed\nby what I hear and see.\"\nVictoria, from the depth of her heart, subscribed to all the eulogies of\nFeodora and Mr. Klumpp. She only found that they were insufficient. As\nshe watched her beloved Albert, after toiling with state documents and\npublic functions, devoting every spare moment of his time to domestic\nduties, to artistic appreciation, and to intellectual improvements; as\nshe listened to him cracking his jokes at the luncheon table, or playing\nMendelssohn on the organ, or pointing out the merits of Sir Edwin\nLandseer's pictures; as she followed him round while he gave\ninstructions about the breeding of cattle, or decided that the\nGainsboroughs must be hung higher up so that the Winterhalters might be\nproperly seen--she felt perfectly certain that no other wife had ever\nhad such a husband. His mind was apparently capable of everything,\nand she was hardly surprised to learn that he had made an important\ndiscovery for the conversion of sewage into agricultural manure.\nFiltration from below upwards, he explained, through some appropriate\nmedium, which retained the solids and set free the fluid sewage for\nirrigation, was the principle of the scheme. \"All previous plans,\"\nhe said, \"would have cost millions; mine costs next to nothing.\"\nUnfortunately, owing to a slight miscalculation, the invention proved\nto be impracticable; but Albert's intelligence was unrebuffed, and he\npassed on, to plunge with all his accustomed ardour into a prolonged\nstudy of the rudiments of lithography.\nBut naturally it was upon his children that his private interests and\nthose of Victoria were concentrated most vigorously. The royal nurseries\nshowed no sign of emptying. The birth of the Prince Arthur in 1850 was\nfollowed, three years later, by that of the Prince Leopold; and in\n1857 the Princess Beatrice was born. A family of nine must be, in any\ncircumstances, a grave responsibility; and the Prince realised to the\nfull how much the high destinies of his offspring intensified the need\nof parental care. It was inevitable that he should believe profoundly\nin the importance of education; he himself had been the product of\neducation; Stockmar had made him what he was; it was for him, in his\nturn, to be a Stockmar--to be even more than a Stockmar--to the young\ncreatures he had brought into the world. Victoria would assist him; a\nStockmar, no doubt, she could hardly be; but she could be perpetually\nvigilant, she could mingle strictness with her affection, and she could\nalways set a good example. These considerations, of course, applied\npre-eminently to the education of the Prince of Wales. How tremendous\nwas the significance of every particle of influence which went to the\nmaking of the future King of England! Albert set to work with a will.\nBut, watching with Victoria the minutest details of the physical,\nintellectual, and moral training of his children, he soon perceived, to\nhis distress, that there was something unsatisfactory in the development\nof his eldest son. The Princess Royal was an extremely intelligent\nchild; but Bertie, though he was good-humoured and gentle, seemed to\ndisplay a deep-seated repugnance to every form of mental exertion. This\nwas most regrettable, but the remedy was obvious: the parental efforts\nmust be redoubled; instruction must be multiplied; not for a single\ninstant must the educational pressure be allowed to relax. Accordingly,\nmore tutors were selected, the curriculum was revised, the time-table of\nstudies was rearranged, elaborate memoranda dealing with every possible\ncontingency were drawn up. It was above all essential that there should\nbe no slackness: \"Work,\" said the Prince, \"must be work.\" And work\nindeed it was. The boy grew up amid a ceaseless round of paradigms,\nsyntactical exercises, dates, genealogical tables, and lists of capes.\nConstant notes flew backwards and forwards between the Prince, the\nQueen, and the tutors, with inquiries, with reports of progress, with\ndetailed recommendations; and these notes were all carefully preserved\nfor future reference. It was, besides, vital that the heir to the throne\nshould be protected from the slightest possibility of contamination from\nthe outside world. The Prince of Wales was not as other boys; he might,\noccasionally, be allowed to invite some sons of the nobility, boys of\ngood character, to play with him in the garden of Buckingham Palace;\nbut his father presided, with alarming precision, over their sports. In\nshort, every possible precaution was taken, every conceivable effort\nwas made. Yet, strange to say, the object of all this vigilance and\nsolicitude continued to be unsatisfactory--appeared, in fact, to be\npositively growing worse. It was certainly very odd: the more lessons\nthat Bertie had to do, the less he did them; and the more carefully he\nwas guarded against excitements and frivolities, the more desirous\nof mere amusement he seemed to become. Albert was deeply grieved and\nVictoria was sometimes very angry; but grief and anger produced no more\neffect than supervision and time-tables. The Prince of Wales, in\nspite of everything, grew up into manhood without the faintest sign of\n\"adherence to and perseverance in the plan both of studies and life--\"\nas one of the Royal memoranda put it--which had been laid down with such",

      "text": "Against the insidious worries of politics, the boredom of society\nfunctions, and the pompous publicity of state ceremonies, Osborne had\nafforded a welcome refuge; but it soon appeared that even Osborne was\ntoo little removed from the world. After all, the Solent was a feeble\nbarrier. Oh, for some distant, some almost inaccessible sanctuary,\nwhere, in true domestic privacy, one could make happy holiday, just as\nif--or at least very, very, nearly--one were anybody else! Victoria,\never since, together with Albert, she had visited Scotland in the early\nyears of her marriage, had felt that her heart was in the Highlands. She\nhad returned to them a few years later, and her passion had grown. How\nromantic they were! And how Albert enjoyed them too! His spirits rose\nquite wonderfully as soon as he found himself among the hills and the\nconifers. \"It is a happiness to see him,\" she wrote. \"Oh! What can equal\nthe beauties of nature!\" she exclaimed in her journal, during one of\nthese visits. \"What enjoyment there is in them! Albert enjoys it so\nmuch; he is in ecstasies here.\" \"Albert said,\" she noted next day, \"that\nthe chief beauty of mountain scenery consists in its frequent changes.\nWe came home at six o'clock.\" Then she went on a longer expedition--up\nto the very top of a high hill. \"It was quite romantic. Here we were\nwith only this Highlander behind us holding the ponies (for we got off\ntwice and walked about). . . . We came home at half-past eleven,--the\nmost delightful, most romantic ride and walk I ever had. I had never\nbeen up such a mountain, and then the day was so fine.\" The Highlanders,\ntoo, were such astonishing people. They \"never make difficulties,\" she\nnoted, \"but are cheerful, and happy, and merry, and ready to walk,\nand run, and do anything.\" As for Albert he \"highly appreciated the\ngood-breeding, simplicity, and intelligence, which make it so pleasant\nand even instructive to talk to them.\" \"We were always in the habit,\"\nwrote Her Majesty, \"of conversing with the Highlanders--with whom one\ncomes so much in contact in the Highlands.\" She loved everything about\nthem--their customs, their dress, their dances, even their musical\ninstruments. \"There were nine pipers at the castle,\" she wrote after\nstaying with Lord Breadalbane; \"sometimes one and sometimes three\nplayed. They always played about breakfast-time, again during the\nmorning, at luncheon, and also whenever we went in and out; again before\ndinner, and during most of dinner-time. We both have become quite fond\nof the bag-pipes.\"\nIt was quite impossible not to wish to return to such pleasures again\nand again; and in 1848 the Queen took a lease of Balmoral House, a small\nresidence near Braemar in the wilds of Aberdeenshire. Four years later\nshe bought the place outright. Now she could be really happy every\nsummer; now she could be simple and at her ease; now she could\nbe romantic every evening, and dote upon Albert, without a single\ndistraction, all day long. The diminutive scale of the house was in\nitself a charm. Nothing was more amusing than to find oneself living\nin two or three little sitting--rooms, with the children crammed away\nupstairs, and the minister in attendance with only a tiny bedroom to do\nall his work in. And then to be able to run in and out of doors as one\nliked, and to sketch, and to walk, and to watch the red deer coming so\nsurprisingly close, and to pay visits to the cottagers! And occasionally\none could be more adventurous still--one could go and stay for a night\nor two at the Bothie at Alt-na-giuthasach--a mere couple of huts with \"a\nwooden addition\"--and only eleven people in the whole party! And there\nwere mountains to be climbed and cairns to be built in solemn pomp. \"At\nlast, when the cairn, which is, I think, seven or eight feet high, was\nnearly completed, Albert climbed up to the top of it, and placed the\nlast stone; after which three cheers were given. It was a gay, pretty,\nand touching sight; and I felt almost inclined to cry. The view was\nso beautiful over the dear hills; the day so fine; the whole so\ngemuthlich.\" And in the evening there were sword-dances and reels.\nBut Albert had determined to pull down the little old house, and to\nbuild in its place a castle of his own designing. With great ceremony,\nin accordance with a memorandum drawn up by the Prince for the occasion,\nthe foundation-stone of the new edifice was laid, and by 1855 it was\nhabitable. Spacious, built of granite in the Scotch baronial style, with\na tower 100 feet high, and minor turrets and castellated gables,\nthe castle was skilfully arranged to command the finest views of the\nsurrounding mountains and of the neighbouring river Dee. Upon the\ninterior decorations Albert and Victoria lavished all their care. The\nwall and the floors were of pitch-pine, and covered with specially\nmanufactured tartars. The Balmoral tartan, in red and grey, designed by\nthe Prince, and the Victoria tartan, with a white stripe, designed by\nthe Queen, were to be seen in every room: there were tartan curtains,\nand tartan chair-covers, and even tartan linoleums. Occasionally the\nRoyal Stuart tartan appeared, for Her Majesty always maintained that she\nwas an ardent Jacobite. Water-colour sketches by Victoria hung upon the\nwalls, together with innumerable stags' antlers, and the head of a boar,\nwhich had been shot by Albert in Germany. In an alcove in the hall,\nstood a life-sized statue of Albert in Highland dress.\nVictoria declared that it was perfection. \"Every year,\" she wrote, \"my\nheart becomes more fixed in this dear paradise, and so much more so\nnow, that ALL has become my dear Albert's own creation, own work, own\nbuilding, own lay-out... and his great taste, and the impress of his\ndear hand, have been stamped everywhere.\"",

      "text": "And here, in very truth, her happiest days were passed. In after years,\nwhen she looked back upon them, a kind of glory, a radiance as of\nan unearthly holiness, seemed to glow about these golden hours. Each\nhallowed moment stood out clear, beautiful, eternally significant. For,\nat the time, every experience there, sentimental, or grave, or trivial,\nhad come upon her with a peculiar vividness, like a flashing of\nmarvellous lights. Albert's stalkings--an evening walk when she lost her\nway--Vicky sitting down on a wasps' nest--a torchlight dance--with what\nintensity such things, and ten thousand like them, impressed themselves\nupon her eager consciousness! And how she flew to her journal to note\nthem down! The news of the Duke's death! What a moment--when, as she\nsat sketching after a picnic by a loch in the lonely hills, Lord Derby's\nletter had been brought to her, and she had learnt that \"ENGLAND'S, or\nrather BRITAIN'S pride, her glory, her hero, the greatest man she had\never produced, was no morel.\" For such were here reflections upon\nthe \"old rebel\" of former days. But that past had been utterly\nobliterated--no faintest memory of it remained. For years she had\nlooked up to the Duke as a figure almost superhuman. Had he not been a\nsupporter of good Sir Robert? Had he not asked Albert to succeed him as\ncommander-in-chief? And what a proud moment it had been when he stood as\nsponsor to her son Arthur, who was born on his eighty-first birthday! So\nnow she filled a whole page of her diary with panegyrical regrets. \"His\nposition was the highest a subject ever had--above party--looked up to\nby all--revered by the whole nation--the friend of the Sovereign... The\nCrown never possessed--and I fear never WILL--so DEVOTED, loyal,\nand faithful a subject, so staunch a supporter! To US his loss is\nIRREPARABLE... To Albert he showed the greatest kindness and the utmost\nconfidence... Not an eye will be dry in the whole country.\" These were\nserious thoughts; but they were soon succeeded by others hardly less\nmoving--by events as impossible to forget--by Mr. MacLeod's sermon\non Nicodemus--by the gift of a red flannel petticoat to Mrs. P.\nFarquharson, and another to old Kitty Kear.\nBut, without doubt, most memorable, most delightful of all were the\nexpeditions--the rare, exciting expeditions up distant mountains, across\nbroad rivers, through strange country, and lasting several days. With\nonly two gillies--Grant and Brown--for servants, and with assumed names.\nIt was more like something in a story than real life. \"We had decided\nto call ourselves LORD AND LADY CHURCHILL AND AND PARTY--Lady Churchill\npassing as MISS SPENCER and General Grey as DR. GREY! Brown once forgot\nthis and called me 'Your Majesty' as I was getting into the carriage,\nand Grant on the box once called Albert 'Your Royal Highness,' which\nset us off laughing, but no one observed it.\" Strong, vigorous,\nenthusiastic, bringing, so it seemed, good fortune with her--the\nHighlanders declared she had \"a lucky foot\"--she relished\neverything--the scrambles and the views and the contretemps and the\nrough inns with their coarse fare and Brown and Grant waiting at table.\nShe could have gone on for ever and ever, absolutely happy with Albert",

      "text": "The Crimean War brought new experiences, and most of them were pleasant\nones. It was pleasant to be patriotic and pugnacious, to look out\nappropriate prayers to be read in the churches, to have news of\nglorious victories, and to know oneself, more proudly than ever, the\nrepresentative of England. With that spontaneity of feeling which was so\npeculiarly her own, Victoria poured out her emotion, her admiration,\nher pity, her love, upon her \"dear soldiers.\" When she gave them their\nmedals her exultation knew no bounds. \"Noble fellows!\" she wrote to the\nKing of the Belgians, \"I own I feel as if these were MY OWN CHILDREN;\nmy heart beats for THEM as for my NEAREST and DEAREST. They were so\ntouched, so pleased; many, I hear, cried--and they won't hear of giving\nup their medals to have their names engraved upon them for fear they\nshould not receive the IDENTICAL ONE put into THEIR HANDS BY ME, which\nis quite touching. Several came by in a sadly mutilated state.\" She and\nthey were at one. They felt that she had done them a splendid honour,\nand she, with perfect genuineness, shared their feeling. Albert's\nattitude towards such things was different; there was an austerity\nin him which quite prohibited the expansions of emotion. When General\nWilliams returned from the heroic defence of Kars and was presented at\nCourt, the quick, stiff, distant bow with which the Prince received him\nstruck like ice upon the beholders. He was a stranger still.\nBut he had other things to occupy him, more important, surely, than the\npersonal impressions of military officers and people who went to Court.\nHe was at work--ceaselessly at work--on the tremendous task of carrying\nthrough the war to a successful conclusion. State papers, despatches,\nmemoranda, poured from him in an overwhelming stream. Between 1853 and\n1857 fifty folio volumes were filled with the comments of his pen upon\nthe Eastern question. Nothing would induce him to stop. Weary ministers\nstaggered under the load of his advice; but his advice continued, piling\nitself up over their writing-tables, and flowing out upon them from\nred box after red box. Nor was it advice to be ignored. The talent for\nadministration which had reorganised the royal palaces and planned the\nGreat Exhibition asserted itself no less in the confused complexities of\nwar. Again and again the Prince's suggestions, rejected or unheeded at\nfirst, were adopted under the stress of circumstances and found to be\nfull of value. The enrolment of a foreign legion, the establishment of\na depot for troops at Malta, the institution of periodical reports and\ntabulated returns as to the condition of the army at Sebastopol--such\nwere the contrivances and the achievements of his indefatigable brain.\nHe went further: in a lengthy minute he laid down the lines for a\nradical reform in the entire administration of the army. This was\npremature, but his proposal that \"a camp of evolution\" should be\ncreated, in which troops should be concentrated and drilled, proved to\nbe the germ of Aldershot.\nMeanwhile Victoria had made a new friend: she had suddenly been\ncaptivated by Napoleon III. Her dislike of him had been strong at first.\nShe considered that he was a disreputable adventurer who had usurped the\nthrone of poor old Louis Philippe; and besides he was hand-in-glove\nwith Lord Palmerston. For a long time, although he was her ally, she was\nunwilling to meet him; but at last a visit of the Emperor and Empress to\nEngland was arranged. Directly he appeared at Windsor her heart began\nto soften. She found that she was charmed by his quiet manners, his\nlow, soft voice, and by the soothing simplicity of his conversation. The\ngood-will of England was essential to the Emperor's position in Europe,\nand he had determined to fascinate the Queen. He succeeded. There was\nsomething deep within her which responded immediately and vehemently to\nnatures that offered a romantic contrast with her own. Her adoration\nof Lord Melbourne was intimately interwoven with her half-unconscious\nappreciation of the exciting unlikeness between herself and that\nsophisticated, subtle, aristocratical old man. Very different was the\nquality of her unlikeness to Napoleon; but its quantity was at least\nas great. From behind the vast solidity of her respectability, her\nconventionality, her established happiness, she peered out with a\nstrange delicious pleasure at that unfamiliar, darkly-glittering foreign\nobject, moving so meteorically before her, an ambiguous creature of\nwilfulness and Destiny. And, to her surprise, where she had dreaded\nantagonisms, she discovered only sympathies. He was, she said, \"so\nquiet, so simple, naif even, so pleased to be informed about things he\ndoes not know, so gentle, so full of tact, dignity, and modesty, so full\nof kind attention towards us, never saying a word, or doing a thing,\nwhich could put me out... There is something fascinating, melancholy,\nand engaging which draws you to him, in spite of any prevention you may\nhave against him, and certainly without the assistance of any outward\nappearance, though I like his face.\" She observed that he rode\n\"extremely well, and looks well on horseback, as he sits high.\" And\nhe danced \"with great dignity and spirit.\" Above all, he listened to\nAlbert; listened with the most respectful attention; showed, in fact,\nhow pleased he was \"to be informed about things he did not know;\" and\nafterwards was heard to declare that he had never met the Prince's\nequal. On one occasion, indeed--but only on one--he had seemed to grow\nslightly restive. In a diplomatic conversation, \"I expatiated a little\non the Holstein question,\" wrote the Prince in a memorandum, \"which\nappeared to bore the Emperor as 'tres compliquee.'\"\nVictoria, too, became much attached to the Empress, whose looks and\ngraces she admired without a touch of jealousy. Eugenie, indeed, in\nthe plenitude of her beauty, exquisitely dressed in wonderful Parisian\ncrinolines which set off to perfection her tall and willowy figure,\nmight well have caused some heart-burning in the breast of her hostess,\nwho, very short, rather stout, quite plain, in garish middle-class\ngarments, could hardly be expected to feel at her best in such company.\nBut Victoria had no misgivings. To her it mattered nothing that her\nface turned red in the heat and that her purple pork-pie hat was of last\nyear's fashion, while Eugenie, cool and modish, floated in an infinitude\nof flounces by her side. She was Queen of England, and was not that\nenough? It certainly seemed to be; true majesty was hers, and she knew\nit. More than once, when the two were together in public, it was the\nwoman to whom, as it seemed, nature and art had given so little, who,\nby the sheer force of an inherent grandeur, completely threw her adorned\nand beautiful companion into the shade.\nThere were tears when the moment came for parting, and Victoria felt\n\"quite wehmuthig,\" as her guests went away from Windsor. But before long\nshe and Albert paid a return visit to France, where everything was very\ndelightful, and she drove incognito through the streets of Paris in a\n\"common bonnet,\" and saw a play in the theatre at St. Cloud, and, one\nevening, at a great party given by the Emperor in her honour at the\nChateau of Versailles, talked a little to a distinguished-looking\nPrussian gentleman, whose name was Bismarck. Her rooms were furnished\nso much to her taste that she declared they gave her quite a home\nfeeling--that, if her little dog were there, she should really imagine\nherself at home. Nothing was said, but three days later her little\ndog barked a welcome to her as she entered the apartments. The Emperor\nhimself, sparing neither trouble nor expense, had personally arranged\nthe charming surprise. Such were his attentions. She returned to England\nmore enchanted than ever. \"Strange indeed,\" she exclaimed, \"are the\ndispensations and ways of Providence!\"\nThe alliance prospered, and the war drew towards a conclusion. Both the\nQueen and the Prince, it is true, were most anxious that there should\nnot be a premature peace. When Lord Aberdeen wished to open negotiations\nAlbert attacked him in a \"geharnischten\" letter, while Victoria rode\nabout on horseback reviewing the troops. At last, however, Sebastopol\nwas captured. The news reached Balmoral late at night, and in a few\nminutes Albert and all the gentlemen in every species of attire sallied\nforth, followed by all the servants, and gradually by all the population\nof the village-keepers, gillies, workmen--\"up to the top of the cairn.\"\nA bonfire was lighted, the pipes were played, and guns were shot off.\n\"About three-quarters of an hour after Albert came down and said the\nscene had been wild and exciting beyond everything. The people had\nbeen drinking healths in whisky and were in great ecstasy.\" The \"great\necstasy,\" perhaps, would be replaced by other feelings next morning;\nbut at any rate the war was over--though, to be sure, its end seemed as\ndifficult to account for as its beginning. The dispensations and ways of\nProvidence continued to be strange.",

The Prince and the\nMinister drew together over their hostility to Russia, and thus it came\nabout that when Victoria found it necessary to summon her old enemy to\nform an administration she did so without reluctance. The premiership,\ntoo, had a sobering effect upon Palmerston; he grew less impatient and\ndictatorial; considered with attention the suggestions of the Crown, and\nwas, besides, genuinely impressed by the Prince's ability and knowledge.\nFriction, no doubt, there still occasionally was, for, while the Queen\nand the Prince devoted themselves to foreign politics as much as ever,\ntheir views, when the war was over, became once more antagonistic to\nthose of the Prime Minister. This was especially the case with regard\nto Italy. Albert, theoretically the friend of constitutional government,\ndistrusted Cavour, was horrified by Garibaldi, and dreaded the danger\nof England being drawn into war with Austria. Palmerston, on the other\nhand, was eager for Italian independence; but he was no longer at the\nForeign Office, and the brunt of the royal displeasure had now to be\nborne by Lord John Russell. In a few years the situation had curiously\naltered. It was Lord John who now filled the subordinate and the\nungrateful role; but the Foreign Secretary, in his struggle with\nthe Crown, was supported, instead of opposed, by the Prime Minister.\nNevertheless the struggle was fierce, and the policy, by which the\nvigorous sympathy of England became one of the decisive factors in the\nfinal achievement of Italian unity, was only carried through in face of\nthe violent opposition of the Court.",

Albert's great\nwish was for a united Germany under the leadership of a constitutional\nand virtuous Prussia; Palmerston did not think that there was much to\nbe said for the scheme, but he took no particular interest in German\npolitics, and was ready enough to agree to a proposal which was warmly\nsupported by both the Prince and the Queen--that the royal Houses of\nEngland and Prussia should be united by the marriage of the Princess\nRoyal with the Prussian Crown Prince. Accordingly, when the Princess was\nnot yet fifteen, the Prince, a young man of twenty-four, came over on\na visit to Balmoral, and the betrothal took place. Two years later,\nin 1857, the marriage was celebrated. At the last moment, however, it\nseemed that there might be a hitch. It was pointed out in Prussia that\nit was customary for Princes of the blood royal to be married in Berlin,\nand it was suggested that there was no reason why the present case\nshould be treated as an exception. When this reached the ears of\nVictoria, she was speechless with indignation. In a note, emphatic\neven for Her Majesty, she instructed the Foreign Secretary to tell\nthe Prussian Ambassador \"not to ENTERTAIN the POSSIBILITY of such a\nquestion... The Queen NEVER could consent to it, both for public and for\nprivate reasons, and the assumption of its being TOO MUCH for a Prince\nRoyal of Prussia to come over to marry the Princess Royal of Great\nBritain in England is too ABSURD to say the least. . . Whatever may be\nthe usual practice of Prussian princes, it is not EVERY day that one\nmarries the eldest daughter of the Queen of England. The question must\ntherefore be considered as settled and closed.\" It was, and the\nwedding took place in St. James's Chapel. There were great\nfestivities--illuminations, state concerts, immense crowds, and general\nrejoicings. At Windsor a magnificent banquet was given to the bride and\nbridegroom in the Waterloo room, at which, Victoria noted in her diary,\n\"everybody was most friendly and kind about Vicky and full of the\nuniversal enthusiasm, of which the Duke of Buccleuch gave us most\npleasing instances, he having been in the very thick of the crowd and\namong the lowest of the low.\" Her feelings during several days had been\ngrowing more and more emotional, and when the time came for the young\ncouple to depart she very nearly broke down--but not quite. \"Poor dear\nchild!\" she wrote afterwards. \"I clasped her in my arms and blessed her,\nand knew not what to say. I kissed good Fritz and pressed his hand again\nand again. He was unable to speak and the tears were in his eyes. I\nembraced them both again at the carriage door, and Albert got into the\ncarriage, an open one, with them and Bertie... The band struck up. I\nwished good-bye to the good Perponchers. General Schreckenstein was much\naffected. I pressed his hand, and the good Dean's, and then went quickly",

      "text": "of ill-health. During a visit to Coburg in 1860, the Prince was very\nnearly killed in a carriage accident. He escaped with a few cuts and\nbruises; but Victoria's alarm was extreme, though she concealed it. \"It\nis when the Queen feels most deeply,\" she wrote afterwards, \"that she\nalways appears calmest, and she could not and dared not allow herself\nto speak of what might have been, or even to admit to herself (and she\ncannot and dare not now) the entire danger, for her head would turn!\"\nHer agitation, in fact, was only surpassed by her thankfulness to God.\nShe felt, she said, that she could not rest \"without doing something to\nmark permanently her feelings,\" and she decided that she would endow a\ncharity in Coburg. \"L1,000, or even L2,000, given either at once, or\nin instalments yearly, would not, in the Queen's opinion, be too much.\"\nEventually, the smaller sum having been fixed upon, it was invested in\na trust, called the \"Victoria-Stift,\" in the name of the Burgomaster and\nchief clergyman of Coburg, who were directed to distribute the interest\nyearly among a certain number of young men and women of exemplary\ncharacter belonging to the humbler ranks of life.\nShortly afterwards the Queen underwent, for the first time in her life,\nthe actual experience of close personal loss. Early in 1861 the Duchess\nof Kent was taken seriously ill, and in March she died. The event\noverwhelmed Victoria. With a morbid intensity, she filled her diary\nfor pages with minute descriptions of her mother's last hours, her\ndissolution, and her corpse, interspersed with vehement apostrophes, and\nthe agitated outpourings of emotional reflection. In the grief of the\npresent the disagreements of the past were totally forgotten. It was the\nhorror and the mystery of Death--Death, present and actual--that seized\nupon the imagination of the Queen. Her whole being, so instinct with\nvitality, recoiled in agony from the grim spectacle of the triumph of\nthat awful power. Her own mother, with whom she had lived so closely and\nso long that she had become a part almost of her existence, had fallen\ninto nothingness before her very eyes! She tried to forget, but she\ncould not. Her lamentations continued with a strange abundance, a\nstrange persistency. It was almost as if, by some mysterious and\nunconscious precognition, she realised that for her, in an especial\nmanner, that grisly Majesty had a dreadful dart in store.\nFor indeed, before the year was out, a far more terrible blow was\nto fall upon her. Albert, who had for long been suffering from\nsleeplessness, went, on a cold and drenching day towards the end of\nNovember, to inspect the buildings for the new Military Academy at\nSandhurst. On his return, it was clear that the fatigue and exposure to\nwhich he had been subjected had seriously affected his health. He was\nattacked by rheumatism, his sleeplessness continued, and he complained\nthat he felt thoroughly unwell. Three days later a painful duty obliged\nhim to visit Cambridge. The Prince of Wales, who had been placed at that\nUniversity in the previous year, was behaving in such a manner that\na parental visit and a parental admonition had become necessary. The\ndisappointed father, suffering in mind and body, carried through his\ntask; but, on his return journey to Windsor, he caught a fatal chill.\nDuring the next week he gradually grew weaker and more miserable. Yet,\ndepressed and enfeebled as he was, he continued to work. It so happened\nthat at that very moment a grave diplomatic crisis had arisen. Civil\nwar had broken out in America, and it seemed as if England, owing to a\nviolent quarrel with the Northern States, was upon the point of being\ndrawn into the conflict. A severe despatch by Lord John Russell was\nsubmitted to the Queen; and the Prince perceived that, if it was sent\noff unaltered, war would be the almost inevitable consequence. At seven\no'clock on the morning of December 1, he rose from his bed, and with a\nquavering hand wrote a series of suggestions for the alteration of the\ndraft, by which its language might be softened, and a way left open for\na peaceful solution of the question. These changes were accepted by the\nGovernment, and war was averted. It was the Prince's last memorandum.\nHe had always declared that he viewed the prospect of death with\nequanimity. \"I do not cling to life,\" he had once said to Victoria. \"You\ndo; but I set no store by it.\" And then he had added: \"I am sure, if I\nhad a severe illness, I should give up at once, I should not struggle\nfor life. I have no tenacity of life.\" He had judged correctly. Before\nhe had been ill many days, he told a friend that he was convinced he\nwould not recover. He sank and sank. Nevertheless, if his case had\nbeen properly understood and skilfully treated from the first, he might\nconceivably have been saved; but the doctors failed to diagnose his\nsymptoms; and it is noteworthy that his principal physician was Sir\nJames Clark. When it was suggested that other advice should be taken,\nSir James pooh-poohed the idea: \"there was no cause for alarm,\" he said.\nBut the strange illness grew worse. At last, after a letter of fierce\nremonstrance from Palmerston, Dr. Watson was sent for; and Dr. Watson\nsaw at once that he had come too late The Prince was in the grip of\ntyphoid fever. \"I think that everything so far is satisfactory,\" said\nSir James Clark.(*)\n(*) Clarendon, II, 253-4: \"One cannot speak with certainty;\nbut it is horrible to think that such a life MAY have been\nsacrificed to Sir J. Clark's selfish jealousy of every\nmember of his profession.\" The Earl of Clarendon to the\nDuchess of Manchester, December 17, 1861.\nThe restlessness and the acute suffering of the earlier days gave place\nto a settled torpor and an ever--deepening gloom. Once the failing\npatient asked for music--\"a fine chorale at a distance;\" and a piano\nhaving been placed in the adjoining room, Princess Alice played on it\nsome of Luther's hymns, after which the Prince repeated \"The Rock of\nAges.\" Sometimes his mind wandered; sometimes the distant past came\nrushing upon him; he heard the birds in the early morning, and was at\nRosenau again, a boy. Or Victoria would come and read to him \"Peveril\nof the Peak,\" and he showed that he could follow the story, and then she\nwould bend over him, and he would murmur \"liebes Frauchen\" and \"gutes\nWeibchen,\" stroking her cheek. Her distress and her agitation were\ngreat, but she was not seriously frightened. Buoyed up by her own\nabundant energies, she would not believe that Albert's might prove\nunequal to the strain. She refused to face such a hideous possibility.\nShe declined to see Dr. Watson. Why should she? Had not Sir James Clark\nassured her that all would be well? Only two days before the end, which\nwas seen now to be almost inevitable by everyone about her, she wrote,\nfull of apparent confidence, to the King of the Belgians: \"I do not sit\nup with him at night,\" she said, \"as I could be of no use; and there is\nnothing to cause alarm.\" The Princess Alice tried to tell her the truth,\nbut her hopefulness would not be daunted. On the morning of December\n14, Albert, just as she had expected, seemed to be better; perhaps\nthe crisis was over. But in the course of the day there was a serious\nrelapse. Then at last she allowed herself to see that she was standing\non the edge of an appalling gulf. The whole family was summoned, and,\none after another, the children took a silent farewell of their father.\n\"It was a terrible moment,\" Victoria wrote in her diary, \"but, thank\nGod! I was able to command myself, and to be perfectly calm, and\nremained sitting by his side.\" He murmured something, but she could not\nhear what it was; she thought he was speaking in French. Then all at\nonce he began to arrange his hair, \"just as he used to do when well and\nhe was dressing.\" \"Es kleines Frauchen,\" she whispered to him; and he\nseemed to understand. For a moment, towards the evening, she went into\nanother room, but was immediately called back; she saw at a glance that\na ghastly change had taken place. As she knelt by the bed, he breathed\ndeeply, breathed gently, breathed at last no more. His features became\nperfectly rigid; she shrieked one long wild shriek that rang through the\nterror-stricken castle and understood that she had lost him for ever.",

      "text": "I\nThe death of the Prince Consort was the central turning-point in the\nhistory of Queen Victoria. She herself felt that her true life had\nceased with her husband's, and that the remainder of her days upon earth\nwas of a twilight nature--an epilogue to a drama that was done. Nor is\nit possible that her biographer should escape a similar impression. For\nhim, too, there is a darkness over the latter half of that long career.\nThe first forty--two years of the Queen's life are illuminated by a\ngreat and varied quantity of authentic information. With Albert's\ndeath a veil descends. Only occasionally, at fitful and disconnected\nintervals, does it lift for a moment or two; a few main outlines, a\nfew remarkable details may be discerned; the rest is all conjecture and\nambiguity. Thus, though the Queen survived her great bereavement for\nalmost as many years as she had lived before it, the chronicle of those\nyears can bear no proportion to the tale of her earlier life. We must be\ncontent in our ignorance with a brief and summary relation.\nThe sudden removal of the Prince was not merely a matter of overwhelming\npersonal concern to Victoria; it was an event of national, of European\nimportance. He was only forty-two, and in the ordinary course of nature\nhe might have been expected to live at least thirty years longer. Had\nhe done so it can hardly be doubted that the whole development of the\nEnglish polity would have been changed. Already at the time of his death\nhe filled a unique place in English public life; already among the inner\ncircle of politicians he was accepted as a necessary and useful part of\nthe mechanism of the State. Lord Clarendon, for instance, spoke of his\ndeath as \"a national calamity of far greater importance than the public\ndream of,\" and lamented the loss of his \"sagacity and foresight,\" which,\nhe declared, would have been \"more than ever valuable\" in the event of\nan American war. And, as time went on, the Prince's influence must have\nenormously increased. For, in addition to his intellectual and moral\nqualities, he enjoyed, by virtue of his position, one supreme advantage\nwhich every other holder of high office in the country was without: he\nwas permanent. Politicians came and went, but the Prince was perpetually\ninstalled at the centre of affairs. Who can doubt that, towards the end\nof the century, such a man, grown grey in the service of the nation,\nvirtuous, intelligent, and with the unexampled experience of a whole\nlife-time of government, would have acquired an extraordinary prestige?\nIf, in his youth, he had been able to pit the Crown against the mighty\nPalmerston and to come off with equal honours from the contest, of what\nmight he not have been capable in his old age? What Minister,\nhowever able, however popular, could have withstood the wisdom, the\nirreproachability, the vast prescriptive authority, of the venerable\nPrince? It is easy to imagine how, under such a ruler, an attempt might\nhave been made to convert England into a State as exactly organised,\nas elaborately trained, as efficiently equipped, and as autocratically\ncontrolled, as Prussia herself. Then perhaps, eventually, under some\npowerful leader--a Gladstone or a Bright--the democratic forces in the\ncountry might have rallied together, and a struggle might have followed\nin which the Monarchy would have been shaken to its foundations. Or, on\nthe other hand, Disraeli's hypothetical prophecy might have come true.\n\"With Prince Albert,\" he said, \"we have buried our... sovereign. This\nGerman Prince has governed England for twenty-one years with a wisdom\nand energy such as none of our kings have ever shown. If he had outlived\nsome of our 'old stagers' he would have given us the blessings of\nabsolute government.\"\nThe English Constitution--that indescribable entity--is a living thing,\ngrowing with the growth of men, and assuming ever-varying forms in\naccordance with the subtle and complex laws of human character. It is\nthe child of wisdom and chance. The wise men of 1688 moulded it into the\nshape we know, but the chance that George I could not speak English\ngave it one of its essential peculiarities--the system of a Cabinet\nindependent of the Crown and subordinate to the Prime Minister. The\nwisdom of Lord Grey saved it from petrifaction and destruction, and\nset it upon the path of Democracy. Then chance intervened once more; a\nfemale sovereign happened to marry an able and pertinacious man; and\nit seemed likely that an element which had been quiescent within it for\nyears--the element of irresponsible administrative power--was about\nto become its predominant characteristic and to change completely the\ndirection of its growth. But what chance gave chance took away. The\nConsort perished in his prime; and the English Constitution, dropping\nthe dead limb with hardly a tremor, continued its mysterious life as if\nhe had never been.",

      "text": "II\nWith appalling suddenness Victoria had exchanged the serene radiance of\nhappiness for the utter darkness of woe. In the first dreadful moments\nthose about her had feared that she might lose her reason, but the iron\nstrain within her held firm, and in the intervals between the intense\nparoxysms of grief it was observed that the Queen was calm. She\nremembered, too, that Albert had always disapproved of exaggerated\nmanifestations of feeling, and her one remaining desire was to do\nnothing but what he would have wished. Yet there were moments when\nher royal anguish would brook no restraints. One day she sent for the\nDuchess of Sutherland, and, leading her to the Prince's room, fell\nprostrate before his clothes in a flood of weeping, while she adjured\nthe Duchess to tell her whether the beauty of Albert's character had\never been surpassed. At other times a feeling akin to indignation swept\nover her. \"The poor fatherless baby of eight months,\" she wrote to the\nKing of the Belgians, \"is now the utterly heartbroken and crushed widow\nof forty-two! My LIFE as a HAPPY one is ENDED! The world is gone for\nME!... Oh! to be cut off in the prime of life--to see our pure, happy,\nquiet, domestic life, which ALONE enabled me to bear my MUCH disliked\nposition, CUT OFF at forty-two--when I HAD hoped with such instinctive\ncertainty that God never WOULD part us, and would let us grow old\ntogether (though HE always talked of the shortness of life)--is TOO\nAWFUL, too cruel!\" The tone of outraged Majesty seems to be discernible.\nDid she wonder in her heart of hearts how the Deity could have dared?\nBut all other emotions gave way before her overmastering determination\nto continue, absolutely unchanged, and for the rest of her life on\nearth, her reverence, her obedience, her idolatry. \"I am anxious to\nrepeat ONE thing,\" she told her uncle, \"and THAT ONE is my firm resolve,\nmy IRREVOCABLE DECISION, viz., that HIS wishes--HIS plans--about\neverything, HIS views about EVERY thing are to be MY LAW! And NO HUMAN\nPOWER will make me swerve from WHAT HE decided and wished.\" She grew\nfierce, she grew furious, at the thought of any possible intrusion\nbetween her and her desire. Her uncle was coming to visit her, and it\nflashed upon her that HE might try to interfere with her and seek\nto \"rule the roost\" as of old. She would give him a hint. \"I am ALSO\nDETERMINED,\" she wrote, \"that NO ONE person--may HE be ever so good,\never so devoted among my servants--is to lead or guide or dictate TO ME.\nI know HOW he would disapprove it... Though miserably weak and utterly\nshattered, my spirit rises when I think ANY wish or plan of his is to\nbe touched or changed, or I am to be MADE TO DO anything.\" She ended her\nletter in grief and affection. She was, she said, his \"ever wretched but\ndevoted child, Victoria R.\" And then she looked at the date: it was the\n24th of December. An agonising pang assailed her, and she dashed down a\npostcript--\"What a Xmas! I won't think of it.\"\nAt first, in the tumult of her distresses, she declared that she could\nnot see her Ministers, and the Princess Alice, assisted by Sir Charles\nPhipps, the keeper of the Privy Purse, performed, to the best of her\nability, the functions of an intermediary. After a few weeks, however,\nthe Cabinet, through Lord John Russell, ventured to warn the Queen that\nthis could not continue. She realised that they were right: Albert would\nhave agreed with them; and so she sent for the Prime Minister. But when\nLord Palmerston arrived at Osborne, in the pink of health, brisk, with\nhis whiskers freshly dyed, and dressed in a brown overcoat, light grey\ntrousers, green gloves, and blue studs, he did not create a very good\nimpression.\nNevertheless, she had grown attached to her old enemy, and the thought\nof a political change filled her with agitated apprehensions. The\nGovernment, she knew, might fall at any moment; she felt she could not\nface such an eventuality; and therefore, six months after the death of\nthe Prince, she took the unprecedented step of sending a private message\nto Lord Derby, the leader of the Opposition, to tell him that she was\nnot in a fit state of mind or body to undergo the anxiety of a change of\nGovernment, and that if he turned the present Ministers out of office it\nwould be at the risk of sacrificing her life--or her reason. When this\nmessage reached Lord Derby he was considerably surprised. \"Dear me!\" was\nhis cynical comment. \"I didn't think she was so fond of them as THAT.\"\nThough the violence of her perturbations gradually subsided, her\ncheerfulness did not return. For months, for years, she continued in\nsettled gloom. Her life became one of almost complete seclusion. Arrayed\nin thickest crepe, she passed dolefully from Windsor to Osborne, from\nOsborne to Balmoral. Rarely visiting the capital, refusing to take any\npart in the ceremonies of state, shutting herself off from the slightest\nintercourse with society, she became almost as unknown to her subjects\nas some potentate of the East. They might murmur, but they did not\nunderstand. What had she to do with empty shows and vain enjoyments? No!\nShe was absorbed by very different preoccupations. She was the devoted\nguardian of a sacred trust. Her place was in the inmost shrine of the\nhouse of mourning--where she alone had the right to enter, where she\ncould feel the effluence of a mysterious presence, and interpret,\nhowever faintly and feebly, the promptings of a still living soul. That,\nand that only was her glorious, her terrible duty. For terrible indeed\nit was. As the years passed her depression seemed to deepen and her\nloneliness to grow more intense. \"I am on a dreary sad pinnacle of\nsolitary grandeur,\" she said. Again and again she felt that she could\nbear her situation no longer--that she would sink under the strain. And\nthen, instantly, that Voice spoke: and she braced herself once more to\nperform, with minute conscientiousness, her grim and holy task.",

      "text": "Above all else, what she had to do was to make her own the\nmaster-impulse of Albert's life--she must work, as he had worked, in the\nservice of the country. That vast burden of toil which he had taken upon\nhis shoulders it was now for her to bear. She assumed the gigantic\nload; and naturally she staggered under it. While he had lived, she had\nworked, indeed, with regularity and conscientiousness; but it was work\nmade easy, made delicious, by his care, his forethought, his advice,\nand his infallibility. The mere sound of his voice, asking her to sign\na paper, had thrilled her; in such a presence she could have laboured\ngladly for ever. But now there was a hideous change. Now there were no\nneat piles and docketings under the green lamp; now there were no simple\nexplanations of difficult matters; now there was nobody to tell her what\nwas right and what was wrong. She had her secretaries, no doubt: there\nwere Sir Charles Phipps, and General Grey, and Sir Thomas Biddulph; and\nthey did their best. But they were mere subordinates: the whole weight\nof initiative and responsibility rested upon her alone. For so it had to\nbe. \"I am DETERMINED\"--had she not declared it?--\"that NO ONE person is\nto lead or guide or dictate to ME;\" anything else would be a betrayal of\nher trust. She would follow the Prince in all things. He had refused to\ndelegate authority; he had examined into every detail with his own eyes;\nhe had made it a rule never to sign a paper without having first, not\nmerely read it, but made notes on it too. She would do the same. She\nsat from morning till night surrounded by huge heaps of despatch--boxes,\nreading and writing at her desk--at her desk, alas! which stood alone\nnow in the room.\nWithin two years of Albert's death a violent disturbance in foreign\npolitics put Victoria's faithfulness to a crucial test. The fearful\nSchleswig-Holstein dispute, which had been smouldering for more than a\ndecade, showed signs of bursting out into conflagration. The complexity\nof the questions at issue was indescribable. \"Only three people,\"\nsaid Palmerston, \"have ever really understood the Schleswig-Holstein\nbusiness--the Prince Consort, who is dead--a German professor, who\nhas gone mad--and I, who have forgotten all about it.\" But, though the\nPrince might be dead, had he not left a vicegerent behind him?\nVictoria threw herself into the seething embroilment with the vigour of\ninspiration. She devoted hours daily to the study of the affair in all\nits windings; but she had a clue through the labyrinth: whenever the\nquestion had been discussed, Albert, she recollected it perfectly, had\nalways taken the side of Prussia. Her course was clear. She became an\nardent champion of the Prussian point of view. It was a legacy from the\nPrince, she said. She did not realise that the Prussia of the Prince's\nday was dead, and that a new Prussia, the Prussia of Bismarck, was born.\nPerhaps Palmerston, with his queer prescience, instinctively apprehended\nthe new danger; at any rate, he and Lord John were agreed upon the\nnecessity of supporting Denmark against Prussia's claims. But opinion\nwas sharply divided, not only in the country but in the Cabinet. For\neighteen months the controversy raged; while the Queen, with persistent\nvehemence, opposed the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary. When at\nlast the final crisis arose--when it seemed possible that England would\njoin forces with Denmark in a war against Prussia--Victoria's agitation\ngrew febrile in its intensity. Towards her German relatives she\npreserved a discreet appearance of impartiality; but she poured out\nupon her Ministers a flood of appeals, protests, and expostulations. She\ninvoked the sacred cause of Peace. \"The only chance of preserving peace\nfor Europe,\" she wrote, \"is by not assisting Denmark, who has brought\nthis entirely upon herself. The Queen suffers much, and her nerves\nare more and more totally shattered... But though all this anxiety is\nwearing her out, it will not shake her firm purpose of resisting any\nattempt to involve this country in a mad and useless combat.\" She was,\nshe declared, \"prepared to make a stand,\" even if the resignation of the\nForeign Secretary should follow. \"The Queen,\" she told Lord Granville,\n\"is completely exhausted by the anxiety and suspense, and misses her\nbeloved husband's help, advice, support, and love in an overwhelming\nmanner.\" She was so worn out by her efforts for peace that she could\n\"hardly hold up her head or hold her pen.\" England did not go to war,\nand Denmark was left to her fate; but how far the attitude of the Queen\ncontributed to this result it is impossible, with our present knowledge,\nto say. On the whole, however, it seems probable that the determining\nfactor in the situation was the powerful peace party in the Cabinet\nrather than the imperious and pathetic pressure of Victoria.",

As the years passed, and the royal mourning remained\nas unrelieved as ever, the animadversions grew more general and more\nsevere. It was observed that the Queen's protracted privacy not only\ncast a gloom over high society, not only deprived the populace of its\npageantry, but also exercised a highly deleterious effect upon the\ndressmaking, millinery, and hosiery trades. This latter consideration\ncarried great weight. At last, early in 1864, the rumour spread that Her\nMajesty was about to go out of mourning, and there was much rejoicing\nin the newspapers; but unfortunately it turned out that the rumour was\nquite without foundation. Victoria, with her own hand, wrote a letter\nto The Times to say so. \"This idea,\" she declared, \"cannot be too\nexplicitly contradicted. The Queen,\" the letter continued, \"heartily\nappreciates the desire of her subjects to see her, and whatever she CAN\ndo to gratify them in this loyal and affectionate wish, she WILL do...\nBut there are other and higher duties than those of mere representation\nwhich are now thrown upon the Queen, alone and unassisted--duties which\nshe cannot neglect without injury to the public service, which weigh\nunceasingly upon her, overwhelming her with work and anxiety.\" The\njustification might have been considered more cogent had it not been\nknown that those \"other and higher duties\" emphasised by the Queen\nconsisted for the most part of an attempt to counteract the\nforeign policy of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell. A large\nsection--perhaps a majority--of the nation were violent partisans of\nDenmark in the Schleswig-Holstein quarrel; and Victoria's support of\nPrussia was widely denounced. A wave of unpopularity, which reminded\nold observers of the period preceding the Queen's marriage more than\ntwenty-five years before, was beginning to rise. The press was rude;\nLord Ellenborough attacked the Queen in the House of Lords; there\nwere curious whispers in high quarters that she had had thoughts of\nabdicating--whispers followed by regrets that she had not done so.\nVictoria, outraged and injured, felt that she was misunderstood. She\nwas profoundly unhappy. After Lord Ellenborough's speech, General Grey\ndeclared that he \"had never seen the Queen so completely upset.\"\n\"Oh, how fearful it is,\" she herself wrote to Lord Granville, \"to be\nsuspected--uncheered--unguided and unadvised--and how alone the poor\nQueen feels!\" Nevertheless, suffer as she might, she was as resolute\nas ever; she would not move by a hair's breadth from the course that a\nsupreme obligation marked out for her; she would be faithful to the end.\nAnd so, when Schleswig-Holstein was forgotten, and even the image of the\nPrince had begun to grow dim in the fickle memories of men, the solitary\nwatcher remained immutably concentrated at her peculiar task. The\nworld's hostility, steadily increasing, was confronted and outfaced by\nthe impenetrable weeds of Victoria.

      "text": "IV\nWords and books may be ambiguous memorials; but who can misinterpret the\nvisible solidity of bronze and stone? At Frogmore, near Windsor, where\nher mother was buried, Victoria constructed, at the cost of L200,000, a\nvast and elaborate mausoleum for herself and her husband. But that was\na private and domestic monument, and the Queen desired that wherever\nher subjects might be gathered together they should be reminded of the\nPrince. Her desire was gratified; all over the country--at Aberdeen, at\nPerth, and at Wolverhampton--statues of the Prince were erected; and\nthe Queen, making an exception to her rule of retirement, unveiled them\nherself. Nor did the capital lag behind. A month after the Prince's\ndeath a meeting was called together at the Mansion House to discuss\nschemes for honouring his memory. Opinions, however, were divided upon\nthe subject. Was a statue or an institution to be preferred? Meanwhile a\nsubscription was opened; an influential committee was appointed, and the\nQueen was consulted as to her wishes in the matter. Her Majesty replied\nthat she would prefer a granite obelisk, with sculptures at the base, to\nan institution. But the committee hesitated: an obelisk, to be worthy\nof the name, must clearly be a monolith; and where was the quarry in\nEngland capable of furnishing a granite block of the required size? It\nwas true that there was granite in Russian Finland; but the committee\nwere advised that it was not adapted to resist exposure to the open air.\nOn the whole, therefore, they suggested that a Memorial Hall should be\nerected, together with a statue of the Prince. Her Majesty assented; but\nthen another difficulty arose. It was found that not more than L60,000\nhad been subscribed--a sum insufficient to defray the double expense.\nThe Hall, therefore, was abandoned; a statue alone was to be erected;\nand certain eminent architects were asked to prepare designs. Eventually\nthe committee had at their disposal a total sum of L120,000, since\nthe public subscribed another L10,000, while L50,000 was voted by\nParliament. Some years later a joint stock company was formed and built,\nas a private speculation, the Albert Hall.\nThe architect whose design was selected, both by the committee and by\nthe Queen, was Mr. Gilbert Scott, whose industry, conscientiousness,\nand genuine piety had brought him to the head of his profession.\nHis lifelong zeal for the Gothic style having given him a special\nprominence, his handiwork was strikingly visible, not only in a\nmultitude of original buildings, but in most of the cathedrals of\nEngland. Protests, indeed, were occasionally raised against his\nrenovations; but Mr. Scott replied with such vigour and unction in\narticles and pamphlets that not a Dean was unconvinced, and he was\npermitted to continue his labours without interruption. On one occasion,\nhowever, his devotion to Gothic had placed him in an unpleasant\nsituation. The Government offices in Whitehall were to be rebuilt; Mr.\nScott competed, and his designs were successful. Naturally, they were in\nthe Gothic style, combining \"a certain squareness and horizontality of\noutline\" with pillar-mullions, gables, high-pitched roofs, and dormers;\nand the drawings, as Mr. Scott himself observed, \"were, perhaps, the\nbest ever sent in to a competition, or nearly so.\" After the usual\ndifficulties and delays the work was at last to be put in hand, when\nthere was a change of Government and Lord Palmerston became Prime\nMinister. Lord Palmerston at once sent for Mr. Scott. \"Well, Mr. Scott,\"\nhe said, in his jaunty way, \"I can't have anything to do with this\nGothic style. I must insist on your making a design in the Italian\nmanner, which I am sure you can do very cleverly.\" Mr. Scott was\nappalled; the style of the Italian renaissance was not only unsightly,\nit was positively immoral, and he sternly refused to have anything to do\nwith it. Thereupon Lord Palmerston assumed a fatherly tone. \"Quite true;\na Gothic architect can't be expected to put up a Classical building;\nI must find someone else.\" This was intolerable, and Mr. Scott, on his\nreturn home, addressed to the Prime Minister a strongly-worded letter,\nin which he dwelt upon his position as an architect, upon his having won\ntwo European competitions, his being an A.R.A., a gold medallist of the\nInstitute, and a lecturer on architecture at the Royal Academy; but it\nwas useless--Lord Palmerston did not even reply. It then occurred to\nMr. Scott that, by a judicious mixture, he might, while preserving the\nessential character of the Gothic, produce a design which would give a\nsuperficial impression of the Classical style. He did so, but no effect\nwas produced upon Lord Palmerston. The new design, he said, was \"neither\none thing nor 'tother--a regular mongrel affair--and he would have\nnothing to do with it either.\" After that Mr. Scott found it necessary\nto recruit for two months at Scarborough, \"with a course of quinine.\" He\nrecovered his tone at last, but only at the cost of his convictions. For\nthe sake of his family he felt that it was his unfortunate duty to obey\nthe Prime Minister; and, shuddering with horror, he constructed the\nGovernment offices in a strictly Renaissance style.\nShortly afterwards Mr. Scott found some consolation in building the St.\nPancras Hotel in a style of his own.\nAnd now another and yet more satisfactory task was his. \"My idea in\ndesigning the Memorial,\" he wrote, \"was to erect a kind of ciborium to\nprotect a statue of the Prince; and its special characteristic was\nthat the ciborium was designed in some degree on the principles of the\nancient shrines. These shrines were models of imaginary buildings, such\nas had never in reality been erected; and my idea was to realise one of\nthese imaginary structures with its precious materials, its inlaying,\nits enamels, etc. etc.\" His idea was particularly appropriate since\nit chanced that a similar conception, though in the reverse order of\nmagnitude, had occurred to the Prince himself, who had designed and\nexecuted several silver cruet-stands upon the same model. At the Queen's\nrequest a site was chosen in Kensington Gardens as near as possible\nto that of the Great Exhibition; and in May, 1864, the first sod was\nturned. The work was long, complicated, and difficult; a great number\nof workmen were employed, besides several subsidiary sculptors and\nmetal--workers under Mr. Scott's direction, while at every stage\nsketches and models were submitted to Her Majesty, who criticised all\nthe details with minute care, and constantly suggested improvements. The\nfrieze, which encircled the base of the monument, was in itself a very\nserious piece of work. \"This,\" said Mr. Scott, \"taken as a whole, is\nperhaps one of the most laborious works of sculpture ever undertaken,\nconsisting, as it does, of a continuous range of figure-sculpture of the\nmost elaborate description, in the highest alto-relievo of life-size, of\nmore than 200 feet in length, containing about 170 figures, and executed\nin the hardest marble which could be procured.\" After three years of\ntoil the memorial was still far from completion, and Mr. Scott thought\nit advisable to give a dinner to the workmen, \"as a substantial\nrecognition of his appreciation of their skill and energy.\" \"Two long\ntables,\" we are told, \"constructed of scaffold planks, were arranged in\nthe workshops, and covered with newspapers, for want of table-cloths.\nUpwards of eighty men sat down. Beef and mutton, plum pudding and cheese\nwere supplied in abundance, and each man who desired it had three pints\nof beer, gingerbeer and lemonade being provided for the teetotalers, who\nformed a very considerable proportion... Several toasts were given and\nmany of the workmen spoke, almost all of them commencing by 'Thanking\nGod that they enjoyed good health;' some alluded to the temperance that\nprevailed amongst them, others observed how little swearing was ever\nheard, whilst all said how pleased and proud they were to be engaged on\nso great a work.\"\nGradually the edifice approached completion. The one hundred and\nseventieth life-size figure in the frieze was chiselled, the granite\npillars arose, the mosaics were inserted in the allegorical pediments,\nthe four colossal statues representing the greater Christian virtues,\nthe four other colossal statues representing the greater moral virtues,\nwere hoisted into their positions, the eight bronzes representing the\ngreater sciences--Astronomy, Chemistry, Geology, Geometry, Rhetoric,\nMedicine, Philosophy, and Physiology--were fixed on their glittering\npinnacles, high in air. The statue of Physiology was particularly\nadmired. \"On her left arm,\" the official description informs us, \"she\nbears a new-born infant, as a representation of the development of the\nhighest and most perfect of physiological forms; her hand points\ntowards a microscope, the instrument which lends its assistance for the\ninvestigation of the minuter forms of animal and vegetable organisms.\"\nAt last the gilded cross crowned the dwindling galaxies of superimposed\nangels, the four continents in white marble stood at the four corners\nof the base, and, seven years after its inception, in July, 1872, the\nmonument was thrown open to the public.\nBut four more years were to elapse before the central figure was ready\nto be placed under its starry canopy. It was designed by Mr. Foley,\nthough in one particular the sculptor's freedom was restricted by Mr.\nScott. \"I have chosen the sitting posture,\" Mr. Scott said, \"as best\nconveying the idea of dignity befitting a royal personage.\" Mr. Foley\nably carried out the conception of his principal. \"In the attitude\nand expression,\" he said, \"the aim has been, with the individuality of\nportraiture, to embody rank, character, and enlightenment, and to convey\na sense of that responsive intelligence indicating an active, rather\nthan a passive, interest in those pursuits of civilisation illustrated\nin the surrounding figures, groups, and relievos... To identify the\nfigure with one of the most memorable undertakings of the public life\nof the Prince--the International Exhibition of 1851--a catalogue of the\nworks collected in that first gathering of the industry of all nations,\nis placed in the right hand.\" The statue was of bronze gilt and weighed\nnearly ten tons.

A new scene opened; and\nnew protagonists--Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli--struggled together\nin the limelight. Victoria, from her post of vantage, watched these\ndevelopments with that passionate and personal interest which she\ninvariably imported into politics. Her prepossessions were of an\nunexpected kind. Mr. Gladstone had been the disciple of her revered\nPeel, and had won the approval of Albert; Mr. Disraeli had hounded Sir\nRobert to his fall with hideous virulence, and the Prince had pronounced\nthat he \"had not one single element of a gentleman in his composition.\"\nYet she regarded Mr. Gladstone with a distrust and dislike which\nsteadily deepened, while upon his rival she lavished an abundance of\nconfidence, esteem, and affection such as Lord Melbourne himself had\nhardly known.\nHer attitude towards the Tory Minister had suddenly changed when\nshe found that he alone among public men had divined her feelings at\nAlbert's death. Of the others she might have said \"they pity me and not\nmy grief;\" but Mr. Disraeli had understood; and all his condolences\nhad taken the form of reverential eulogies of the departed. The Queen\ndeclared that he was \"the only person who appreciated the Prince.\"\nShe began to show him special favour; gave him and his wife two of the\ncoveted seats in St. George's Chapel at the Prince of Wales's wedding,\nand invited him to stay a night at Windsor. When the grant for the\nAlbert Memorial came before the House of Commons, Disraeli, as leader of\nthe Opposition, eloquently supported the project. He was rewarded by\na copy of the Prince's speeches, bound in white morocco, with an\ninscription in the royal hand. In his letter of thanks he \"ventured\nto touch upon a sacred theme,\" and, in a strain which re-echoed with\nmasterly fidelity the sentiments of his correspondent, dwelt at length\nupon the absolute perfection of Albert. \"The Prince,\" he said, \"is the\nonly person whom Mr. Disraeli has ever known who realised the Ideal.\nNone with whom he is acquainted have ever approached it. There was in\nhim a union of the manly grace and sublime simplicity, of chivalry with\nthe intellectual splendour of the Attic Academe. The only character in\nEnglish history that would, in some respects, draw near to him is Sir\nPhilip Sidney: the same high tone, the same universal accomplishments,\nthe same blended tenderness and vigour, the same rare combination of\nromantic energy and classic repose.\" As for his own acquaintance\nwith the Prince, it had been, he said, \"one of the most satisfactory\nincidents of his life: full of refined and beautiful memories, and\nexercising, as he hopes, over his remaining existence, a soothing\nand exalting influence.\" Victoria was much affected by \"the depth and\ndelicacy of these touches,\" and henceforward Disraeli's place in her\naffections was assured. When, in 1866, the Conservatives came into\noffice, Disraeli's position as Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader\nof the House necessarily brought him into a closer relation with the\nSovereign. Two years later Lord Derby resigned, and Victoria, with\nintense delight and peculiar graciousness, welcomed Disraeli as her\nFirst Minister.\nBut only for nine agitated months did he remain in power. The Ministry,\nin a minority in the Commons, was swept out of existence by a general\nelection. Yet by the end of that short period the ties which bound\ntogether the Queen and her Premier had grown far stronger than ever",

Therefore it had better be as\nproposed, the entire beard, only it should be kept short and very\nclean.\" After thinking over the question for another week, the Queen\nwrote a final letter. She wished, she said, \"to make one additional\nobservation respecting the beards, viz. that on no account should\nmoustaches be allowed without beards.

When the Cabinet met, the Prime\nMinister, filled with his beatific vision, would open the proceedings by\nreading aloud the letters which he had received from the Queen upon the\nquestions of the hour. The assembly sat in absolute silence while,\none after another, the royal missives, with their emphases, their\nejaculations, and their grammatical peculiarities, boomed forth in all\nthe deep solemnity of Mr. Gladstone's utterance. Not a single comment,\nof any kind, was ever hazarded; and, after a fitting pause, the Cabinet\nproceeded with the business of the day.\nII\nLittle as Victoria appreciated her Prime Minister's attitude towards\nher, she found that it had its uses. The popular discontent at her\nuninterrupted seclusion had been gathering force for many years, and\nnow burst out in a new and alarming shape. Republicanism was in the air.\nRadical opinion in England, stimulated by the fall of Napoleon III and\nthe establishment of a republican government in France, suddenly grew\nmore extreme than it ever had been since 1848. It also became for the\nfirst time almost respectable. Chartism had been entirely an affair of\nthe lower classes; but now Members of Parliament, learned professors,\nand ladies of title openly avowed the most subversive views. The\nmonarchy was attacked both in theory and in practice. And it was\nattacked at a vital point: it was declared to be too expensive. What\nbenefits, it was asked, did the nation reap to counterbalance the\nenormous sums which were expended upon the Sovereign? Victoria's\nretirement gave an unpleasant handle to the argument. It was pointed out\nthat the ceremonial functions of the Crown had virtually lapsed; and the\nawkward question remained whether any of the other functions which it\ndid continue to perform were really worth L385,000 per annum. The royal\nbalance-sheet was curiously examined. An anonymous pamphlet entitled\n\"What does she do with it?\" appeared, setting forth the financial\nposition with malicious clarity. The Queen, it stated, was granted by\nthe Civil List L60,000 a year for her private use; but the rest of her\nvast annuity was given, as the Act declared, to enable her \"to defray\nthe expenses of her royal household and to support the honour and\ndignity of the Crown.\" Now it was obvious that, since the death of the\nPrince, the expenditure for both these purposes must have been very\nconsiderably diminished, and it was difficult to resist the conclusion\nthat a large sum of money was diverted annually from the uses for which\nit had been designed by Parliament, to swell the private fortune of\nVictoria. The precise amount of that private fortune it was impossible\nto discover; but there was reason to suppose that it was gigantic;\nperhaps it reached a total of five million pounds. The pamphlet\nprotested against such a state of affairs, and its protests were\nrepeated vigorously in newspapers and at public meetings. Though it is\ncertain that the estimate of Victoria's riches was much exaggerated,\nit is equally certain that she was an exceedingly wealthy woman. She\nprobably saved L20,000 a year from the Civil List, the revenues of\nthe Duchy of Lancaster were steadily increasing, she had inherited a\nconsiderable property from the Prince Consort, and she had been left, in\n1852, an estate of half a million by Mr. John Neild, an eccentric\nmiser. In these circumstances it was not surprising that when, in 1871,\nParliament was asked to vote a dowry of L30,000 to the Princess Louise\non her marriage with the eldest son of the Duke of Argyle, together with\nan annuity of L6,000, there should have been a serious outcry(*).\n(*) In 1889 it was officially stated that the Queen's total\nsavings from the Civil List amounted to L824,025, but that\nout of this sum much had been spent on special\nentertainments to foreign visitors. Taking into\nconsideration the proceeds from the Duchy of Lancaster,\nwhich were more than L60,000 a year, the savings of the\nPrince Consort, and Mr. Neild's legacy, it seems probable\nthat, at the time of her death, Victoria's private fortune\napproached two million pounds.\nIn order to conciliate public opinion, the Queen opened Parliament in\nperson, and the vote was passed almost unanimously. But a few months\nlater another demand was made: the Prince Arthur had come of age, and\nthe nation was asked to grant him an annuity of L15,000. The outcry was\nredoubled. The newspapers were filled with angry articles; Bradlaugh\nthundered against \"princely paupers\" to one of the largest crowds that\nhad ever been seen in Trafalgar Square; and Sir Charles Dilke expounded\nthe case for a republic in a speech to his constituents at Newcastle.\nThe Prince's annuity was ultimately sanctioned in the House of Commons\nby a large majority; but a minority of fifty members voted in favour of\nreducing the sum to L10,000.\nTowards every aspect of this distasteful question, Mr. Gladstone\npresented an iron front. He absolutely discountenanced the extreme\nsection of his followers. He declared that the whole of the Queen's\nincome was justly at her personal disposal, argued that to complain\nof royal savings was merely to encourage royal extravagance, and\nsuccessfully convoyed through Parliament the unpopular annuities, which,\nhe pointed out, were strictly in accordance with precedent. When, in\n1872, Sir Charles Dilke once more returned to the charge in the House\nof Commons, introducing a motion for a full enquiry into the Queen's\nexpenditure with a view to a root and branch reform of the Civil\nList, the Prime Minister brought all the resources of his powerful\nand ingenious eloquence to the support of the Crown. He was completely\nsuccessful; and amid a scene of great disorder the motion was\nignominiously dismissed. Victoria was relieved; but she grew no fonder\nof Mr. Gladstone.\nIt was perhaps the most miserable moment of her life. The Ministers,\nthe press, the public, all conspired to vex her, to blame her, to\nmisinterpret her actions, to be unsympathetic and disrespectful in\nevery way. She was \"a cruelly misunderstood woman,\" she told Mr. Martin,\ncomplaining to him bitterly of the unjust attacks which were made upon\nher, and declaring that \"the great worry and anxiety and hard work for\nten years, alone, unaided, with increasing age and never very strong\nhealth\" were breaking her down, and \"almost drove her to despair.\" The\nsituation was indeed deplorable. It seemed as if her whole existence\nhad gone awry; as if an irremediable antagonism had grown up between the\nQueen and the nation. If Victoria had died in the early seventies, there\ncan be little doubt that the voice of the world would have pronounced\nher a failure.",

      "text": "Then there followed six years of excitement, of enchantment, of\nfelicity, of glory, of romance. The amazing being, who now at last, at\nthe age of seventy, after a lifetime of extraordinary struggles, had\nturned into reality the absurdest of his boyhood's dreams, knew well\nenough how to make his own, with absolute completeness, the heart of the\nSovereign Lady whose servant, and whose master, he had so miraculously\nbecome. In women's hearts he had always read as in an open book. His\nwhole career had turned upon those curious entities; and the more\ncurious they were, the more intimately at home with them he seemed\nto be. But Lady Beaconsfield, with her cracked idolatry, and Mrs.\nBrydges-Williams, with her clogs, her corpulence, and her legacy,\nwere gone: an even more remarkable phenomenon stood in their place. He\nsurveyed what was before him with the eye of a past-master; and he was\nnot for a moment at a loss. He realised everything--the interacting\ncomplexities of circumstance and character, the pride of place mingled\nso inextricably with personal arrogance, the superabundant emotionalism,\nthe ingenuousness of outlook, the solid, the laborious respectability,\nshot through so incongruously by temperamental cravings for the\ncoloured and the strange, the singular intellectual limitations, and the\nmysteriously essential female elements impregnating every particle of\nthe whole. A smile hovered over his impassive features, and he\ndubbed Victoria \"the Faery.\" The name delighted him, for, with that\nepigrammatic ambiguity so dear to his heart, it precisely expressed\nhis vision of the Queen. The Spenserian allusion was very pleasant--the\nelegant evocations of Gloriana; but there was more in it than that:\nthere was the suggestion of a diminutive creature, endowed with\nmagical--and mythical--properties, and a portentousness almost\nridiculously out of keeping with the rest of her make-up. The Faery, he\ndetermined, should henceforward wave her wand for him alone. Detachment\nis always a rare quality, and rarest of all, perhaps, among politicians;\nbut that veteran egotist possessed it in a supreme degree. Not only did\nhe know what he had to do, not only did he do it; he was in the audience\nas well as on the stage; and he took in with the rich relish of a\nconnoisseur every feature of the entertaining situation, every phase of\nthe delicate drama, and every detail of his own consummate performance.\nThe smile hovered and vanished, and, bowing low with Oriental gravity\nand Oriental submissiveness, he set himself to his task. He had\nunderstood from the first that in dealing with the Faery the appropriate\nmethod of approach was the very antithesis of the Gladstonian; and such\na method was naturally his. It was not his habit to harangue and exhort\nand expatiate in official conscientiousness; he liked to scatter flowers\nalong the path of business, to compress a weighty argument into a happy\nphrase, to insinuate what was in his mind with an air of friendship\nand confidential courtesy. He was nothing if not personal; and he had\nperceived that personality was the key that opened the Faery's heart.\nAccordingly, he never for a moment allowed his intercourse with her to\nlose the personal tone; he invested all the transactions of State with\nthe charms of familiar conversation; she was always the royal lady, the\nadored and revered mistress, he the devoted and respectful friend. When\nonce the personal relation was firmly established, every difficulty\ndisappeared. But to maintain that relation uninterruptedly in a smooth\nand even course a particular care was necessary: the bearings had to be\nmost assiduously oiled. Nor was Disraeli in any doubt as to the nature\nof the lubricant. \"You have heard me called a flatterer,\" he said to\nMatthew Arnold, \"and it is true. Everyone likes flattery, and when you\ncome to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.\" He practiced what\nhe preached. His adulation was incessant, and he applied it in the very\nthickest slabs. \"There is no honor and no reward,\" he declared, \"that\nwith him can ever equal the possession of your Majesty's kind thoughts.\nAll his own thoughts and feelings and duties and affections are now\nconcentrated in your Majesty, and he desires nothing more for his\nremaining years than to serve your Majesty, or, if that service\nceases, to live still on its memory as a period of his existence most\ninteresting and fascinating.\" \"In life,\" he told her, \"one must have for\none's thoughts a sacred depository, and Lord Beaconsfield ever presumes\nto seek that in his Sovereign Mistress.\" She was not only his own\nsolitary support; she was the one prop of the State. \"If your Majesty\nis ill,\" he wrote during a grave political crisis, \"he is sure he will\nhimself break down. All, really, depends upon your Majesty.\" \"He lives\nonly for Her,\" he asseverated, \"and works only for Her, and without Her\nall is lost.\" When her birthday came he produced an elaborate confection\nof hyperbolic compliment. \"To-day Lord Beaconsfield ought fitly,\nperhaps, to congratulate a powerful Sovereign on her imperial sway, the\nvastness of her Empire, and the success and strength of her fleets and\narmies. But he cannot, his mind is in another mood. He can only think of\nthe strangeness of his destiny that it has come to pass that he should\nbe the servant of one so great, and whose infinite kindness, the\nbrightness of whose intelligence and the firmness of whose will, have\nenabled him to undertake labours to which he otherwise would be quite\nunequal, and supported him in all things by a condescending sympathy,\nwhich in the hour of difficulty alike charms and inspires. Upon the\nSovereign of many lands and many hearts may an omnipotent Providence\nshed every blessing that the wise can desire and the virtuous deserve!\"\nIn those expert hands the trowel seemed to assume the qualities of\nsome lofty masonic symbol--to be the ornate and glittering vehicle of\nverities unrealised by the profane.\nSuch tributes were delightful, but they remained in the nebulous region\nof words, and Disraeli had determined to give his blandishments a more\nsignificant solidity. He deliberately encouraged those high views of\nher own position which had always been native to Victoria's mind and\nhad been reinforced by the principles of Albert and the doctrines of\nStockmar. He professed to a belief in a theory of the Constitution which\ngave the Sovereign a leading place in the councils of government;\nbut his pronouncements upon the subject were indistinct; and when he\nemphatically declared that there ought to be \"a real Throne,\" it was\nprobably with the mental addition that that throne would be a very\nunreal one indeed whose occupant was unamenable to his cajoleries.\nBut the vagueness of his language was in itself an added stimulant to\nVictoria. Skilfully confusing the woman and the Queen, he threw, with a\ngrandiose gesture, the government of England at her feet, as if in doing\nso he were performing an act of personal homage. In his first audience\nafter returning to power, he assured her that \"whatever she wished\nshould be done.\" When the intricate Public Worship Regulation Bill was\nbeing discussed by the Cabinet, he told the Faery that his \"only object\"\nwas \"to further your Majesty's wishes in this matter.\" When he brought\noff his great coup over the Suez Canal, he used expressions which\nimplied that the only gainer by the transaction was Victoria. \"It is\njust settled,\" he wrote in triumph; \"you have it, Madam... Four millions\nsterling! and almost immediately. There was only one firm that could\ndo it--Rothschilds. They behaved admirably; advanced the money at a low\nrate, and the entire interest of the Khedive is now yours, Madam.\" Nor\ndid he limit himself to highly-spiced insinuations. Writing with all\nthe authority of his office, he advised the Queen that she had the\nconstitutional right to dismiss a Ministry which was supported by a\nlarge majority in the House of Commons, he even urged her to do so, if,\nin her opinion, \"your Majesty's Government have from wilfulness, or even\nfrom weakness, deceived your Majesty.\" To the horror of Mr. Gladstone,\nhe not only kept the Queen informed as to the general course of business\nin the Cabinet, but revealed to her the part taken in its discussions by\nindividual members of it. Lord Derby, the son of the late Prime Minister\nand Disraeli's Foreign Secretary, viewed these developments with grave\nmistrust. \"Is there not,\" he ventured to write to his Chief, \"just a\nrisk of encouraging her in too large ideas of her personal power, and\ntoo great indifference to what the public expects? I only ask; it is for\nyou to judge.\"\nAs for Victoria, she accepted everything--compliments, flatteries,\nElizabethan prerogatives--without a single qualm. After the long gloom\nof her bereavement, after the chill of the Gladstonian discipline, she\nexpanded to the rays of Disraeli's devotion like a flower in the sun.\nThe change in her situation was indeed miraculous. No longer was she\nobliged to puzzle for hours over the complicated details of business,\nfor now she had only to ask Mr. Disraeli for an explanation, and he\nwould give it her in the most concise, in the most amusing, way. No\nlonger was she worried by alarming novelties; no longer was she put out\nat finding herself treated, by a reverential gentleman in high collars,\nas if she were some embodied precedent, with a recondite knowledge of\nGreek. And her deliverer was surely the most fascinating of men. The\nstrain of charlatanism, which had unconsciously captivated her in\nNapoleon III, exercised the same enchanting effect in the case of\nDisraeli. Like a dram-drinker, whose ordinary life is passed in dull\nsobriety, her unsophisticated intelligence gulped down his rococo\nallurements with peculiar zest. She became intoxicated, entranced.\nBelieving all that he told her of herself, she completely regained the\nself-confidence which had been slipping away from her throughout",

      "text": "the dark period that followed Albert's death. She swelled with a new\nelation, while he, conjuring up before her wonderful Oriental visions,\ndazzled her eyes with an imperial grandeur of which she had only dimly\ndreamed. Under the compelling influence, her very demeanour altered.\nHer short, stout figure, with its folds of black velvet, its muslin\nstreamers, its heavy pearls at the heavy neck, assumed an almost\nmenacing air. In her countenance, from which the charm of youth had long\nsince vanished, and which had not yet been softened by age, the traces\nof grief, of disappointment, and of displeasure were still visible, but\nthey were overlaid by looks of arrogance and sharp lines of peremptory\nhauteur. Only, when Mr. Disraeli appeared, the expression changed in an\ninstant, and the forbidding visage became charged with smiles. For him\nshe would do anything. Yielding to his encouragements, she began to\nemerge from her seclusion; she appeared in London in semi-state, at\nhospitals and concerts; she opened Parliament; she reviewed troops and\ndistributed medals at Aldershot. But such public signs of favour were\ntrivial in comparison with her private attentions. During his flours of\naudience, she could hardly restrain her excitement and delight. \"I can\nonly describe my reception,\" he wrote to a friend on one occasion, \"by\ntelling you that I really thought she was going to embrace me. She was\nwreathed with smiles, and, as she tattled, glided about the room like\na bird.\" In his absence, she talked of him perpetually, and there was\na note of unusual vehemence in her solicitude for his health. \"John\nManners,\" Disraeli told Lady Bradford, \"who has just come from Osborne,\nsays that the Faery only talked of one subject, and that was her Primo.\nAccording to him, it was her gracious opinion that the Government should\nmake my health a Cabinet question. Dear John seemed quite surprised at\nwhat she said; but you are used to these ebullitions.\" She often sent\nhim presents; an illustrated album arrived for him regularly from\nWindsor on Christmas Day. But her most valued gifts were the bunches of\nspring flowers which, gathered by herself and her ladies in the woods at\nOsborne, marked in an especial manner the warmth and tenderness of her\nsentiments. Among these it was, he declared, the primroses that he loved\nthe best. They were, he said, \"the ambassadors of Spring, the gems and\njewels of Nature.\" He liked them, he assured her, \"so much better for\ntheir being wild; they seem an offering from the Fauns and Dryads of\nOsborne.\" \"They show,\" he told her, \"that your Majesty's sceptre has\ntouched the enchanted Isle.\" He sat at dinner with heaped-up bowls of\nthem on every side, and told his guests that \"they were all sent to me\nthis morning by the Queen from Osborne, as she knows it is my favorite\nflower.\"\nAs time went on, and as it became clearer and clearer that the\nFaery's thraldom was complete, his protestations grew steadily more\nhighly--coloured and more unabashed. At last he ventured to import\ninto his blandishments a strain of adoration that was almost avowedly\nromantic. In phrases of baroque convolution, he conveyed the message\nof his heart. \"The pressure of business,\" he wrote, had \"so absorbed and\nexhausted him, that towards the hour of post he has not had clearness\nof mind, and vigour of pen, adequate to convey his thoughts and facts to\nthe most loved and illustrious being, who deigns to consider them.\" She\nsent him some primroses, and he replied that he could \"truly say they\nare 'more precious than rubies,' coming, as they do, and at such a\nmoment, from a Sovereign whom he adores.\" She sent him snowdrops, and\nhis sentiment overflowed into poetry. \"Yesterday eve,\" he wrote, \"there\nappeared, in Whitehall Gardens, a delicate-looking case, with a royal\nsuperscription, which, when he opened, he thought, at first, that your\nMajesty had graciously bestowed upon him the stars of your Majesty's\nprincipal orders.\" And, indeed, he was so impressed with this graceful\nillusion, that, having a banquet, where there were many stars and\nribbons, he could not resist the temptation, by placing some snowdrops\non his heart, of showing that, he, too, was decorated by a gracious\nSovereign.\nThen, in the middle of the night, it occurred to him, that it might all\nbe an enchantment, and that, perhaps, it was a Faery gift and came from\nanother monarch: Queen Titania, gathering flowers, with her Court, in\na soft and sea-girt isle, and sending magic blossoms, which, they say,\nturn the heads of those who receive them.\nA Faery gift! Did he smile as he wrote the words? Perhaps; and yet\nit would be rash to conclude that his perfervid declarations were\naltogether without sincerity. Actor and spectator both, the two\ncharacters were so intimately blended together in that odd composition\nthat they formed an inseparable unity, and it was impossible to say that\none of them was less genuine than the other. With one element, he\ncould coldly appraise the Faery's intellectual capacity, note with some\nsurprise that she could be on occasion \"most interesting and amusing,\"\nand then continue his use of the trowel with an ironical solemnity;\nwhile, with the other, he could be overwhelmed by the immemorial panoply\nof royalty, and, thrilling with the sense of his own strange elevation,\ndream himself into a gorgeous phantasy of crowns and powers and\nchivalric love. When he told Victoria that \"during a somewhat romantic\nand imaginative life, nothing has ever occurred to him so interesting as\nthis confidential correspondence with one so exalted and so inspiring,\"\nwas he not in earnest after all? When he wrote to a lady about the\nCourt, \"I love the Queen--perhaps the only person in this world left to\nme that I do love,\" was he not creating for himself an enchanted palace\nout of the Arabian Nights, full of melancholy and spangles, in which\nhe actually believed? Victoria's state of mind was far more simple;\nuntroubled by imaginative yearnings, she never lost herself in that\nnebulous region of the spirit where feeling and fancy grow confused. Her\nemotions, with all their intensity and all their exaggeration, retained\nthe plain prosaic texture of everyday life. And it was fitting that her\nexpression of them should be equally commonplace. She was, she told her\nPrime Minister, at the end of an official letter, \"yours aff'ly V. R.\nand I.\" In such a phrase the deep reality of her feeling is instantly\nmanifest. The Faery's feet were on the solid earth; it was the ruse\ncynic who was in the air.\nHe had taught her, however, a lesson, which she had learnt with alarming\nrapidity. A second Gloriana, did he call her? Very well, then, she would\nshow that she deserved the compliment. Disquieting symptoms followed\nfast. In May, 1874, the Tsar, whose daughter had just been married to\nVictoria's second son, the Duke of Edinburgh, was in London, and, by an\nunfortunate error, it had been arranged that his departure should not\ntake place until two days after the date on which his royal hostess had\npreviously decided to go to Balmoral. Her Majesty refused to modify\nher plans. It was pointed out to her that the Tsar would certainly be\noffended, that the most serious consequences might follow; Lord Derby\nprotested; Lord Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, was much\nperturbed. But the Faery was unconcerned; she had settled to go to\nBalmoral on the 18th, and on the 18th she would go. At last Disraeli,\nexercising all his influence, induced her to agree to stay in London\nfor two days more. \"My head is still on my shoulders,\" he told Lady\nBradford. \"The great lady has absolutely postponed her departure!\nEverybody had failed, even the Prince of Wales... and I have no doubt I\nam not in favour. I can't help it. Salisbury says I have saved an Afghan\nWar, and Derby compliments me on my unrivalled triumph.\" But before very\nlong, on another issue, the triumph was the Faery's. Disraeli, who had\nsuddenly veered towards a new Imperialism, had thrown out the suggestion\nthat the Queen of England ought to become the Empress of India. Victoria\nseized upon the idea with avidity, and, in season and out of season,\npressed upon her Prime Minister the desirability of putting his proposal\ninto practice. He demurred; but she was not to be baulked; and in 1876,\nin spite of his own unwillingness and that of his entire Cabinet, he\nfound himself obliged to add to the troubles of a stormy session\nby introducing a bill for the alteration of the Royal Title. His\ncompliance, however, finally conquered the Faery's heart. The measure\nwas angrily attacked in both Houses, and Victoria was deeply touched by\nthe untiring energy with which Disraeli defended it. She was, she said,\nmuch grieved by \"the worry and annoyance\" to which he was subjected; she\nfeared she was the cause of it; and she would never forget what she owed\nto \"her kind, good, and considerate friend.\" At the same time, her wrath\nfell on the Opposition. Their conduct, she declared, was \"extraordinary,\nincomprehensible, and mistaken,\" and, in an emphatic sentence which\nseemed to contradict both itself and all her former proceedings, she\nprotested that she \"would be glad if it were more generally known that\nit was HER wish, as people WILL have it, that it has been FORCED UPON\nHER!\" When the affair was successfully over, the imperial triumph was",

      "text": "celebrated in a suitable manner. On the day of the Delhi Proclamation,\nthe new Earl of Beaconsfield went to Windsor to dine with the new\nEmpress of India. That night the Faery, usually so homely in her attire,\nappeared in a glittering panoply of enormous uncut jewels, which had\nbeen presented to her by the reigning Princes of her Raj. At the end of\nthe meal the Prime Minister, breaking through the rules of\netiquette, arose, and in a flowery oration proposed the health of\nthe Queen-Empress. His audacity was well received, and his speech was\nrewarded by a smiling curtsey.\nThese were significant episodes; but a still more serious manifestation\nof Victoria's temper occurred in the following year, during the crowning\ncrisis of Beaconsfield's life. His growing imperialism, his desire\nto magnify the power and prestige of England, his insistence upon a\n\"spirited foreign policy,\" had brought him into collision with Russia;\nthe terrible Eastern Question loomed up; and when war broke out between\nRussia and Turkey, the gravity of the situation became extreme.\nThe Prime Minister's policy was fraught with difficulty and danger.\nRealising perfectly the appalling implications of an Anglo-Russian war,\nhe was yet prepared to face even that eventuality if he could obtain\nhis ends by no other method; but he believed that Russia in reality was\nstill less desirous of a rupture, and that, if he played his game with\nsufficient boldness and adroitness, she would yield, when it came to the\npoint, all that he required without a blow. It was clear that the\ncourse he had marked out for himself was full of hazard, and demanded\nan extraordinary nerve; a single false step, and either himself, or\nEngland, might be plunged in disaster. But nerve he had never lacked;\nhe began his diplomatic egg-dance with high assurance; and then he\ndiscovered that, besides the Russian Government, besides the Liberals\nand Mr. Gladstone, there were two additional sources of perilous\nembarrassment with which he would have to reckon. In the first place\nthere was a strong party in the Cabinet, headed by Lord Derby, the\nForeign Secretary, which was unwilling to take the risk of war; but his\nculminating anxiety was the Faery.\nFrom the first, her attitude was uncompromising. The old hatred of\nRussia, which had been engendered by the Crimean War, surged up again\nwithin her; she remembered Albert's prolonged animosity; she felt the\nprickings of her own greatness; and she flung herself into the turmoil\nwith passionate heat. Her indignation with the Opposition--with anyone\nwho ventured to sympathise with the Russians in their quarrel with the\nTurks--was unbounded. When anti-Turkish meetings were held in London,\npresided over by the Duke of Westminster and Lord Shaftesbury, and\nattended by Mr. Gladstone and other prominent Radicals, she considered\nthat \"the Attorney-General ought to be set at these men;\" \"it can't,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"be constitutional.\" Never in her life, not even in the\ncrisis over the Ladies of the Bedchamber, did she show herself a more\nfurious partisan. But her displeasure was not reserved for the Radicals;\nthe backsliding Conservatives equally felt its force. She was even\ndiscontented with Lord Beaconsfield himself. Failing entirely to\nappreciate the delicate complexity of his policy, she constantly\nassailed him with demands for vigorous action, interpreted each finesse\nas a sign of weakness, and was ready at every juncture to let slip the\ndogs of war. As the situation developed, her anxiety grew feverish. \"The\nQueen,\" she wrote, \"is feeling terribly anxious lest delay should cause\nus to be too late and lose our prestige for ever! It worries her night\nand day.\" \"The Faery,\" Beaconsfield told Lady Bradford, \"writes every\nday and telegraphs every hour; this is almost literally the case.\" She\nraged loudly against the Russians. \"And the language,\" she cried,\n\"the insulting language--used by the Russians against us! It makes the\nQueen's blood boil!\" \"Oh,\" she wrote a little later, \"if the Queen were\na man, she would like to go and give those Russians, whose word one\ncannot believe, such a beating! We shall never be friends again till we\nhave it out. This the Queen feels sure of.\"\nThe unfortunate Prime Minister, urged on to violence by Victoria on\none side, had to deal, on the other, with a Foreign Secretary who was\nfundamentally opposed to any policy of active interference at all.\nBetween the Queen and Lord Derby he held a harassed course. He gained,\nindeed, some slight satisfaction in playing on the one against the\nother--in stimulating Lord Derby with the Queen's missives, and in\nappeasing the Queen by repudiating Lord Derby's opinions; on one\noccasion he actually went so far as to compose, at Victoria's request,\na letter bitterly attacking his colleague, which Her Majesty forthwith\nsigned, and sent, without alteration, to the Foreign Secretary. But such\ndevices only gave a temporary relief; and it soon became evident that\nVictoria's martial ardour was not to be sidetracked by hostilities\nagainst Lord Derby; hostilities against Russia were what she wanted,\nwhat she would, what she must, have. For now, casting aside the last\nrelics of moderation, she began to attack her friend with a series of\nextraordinary threats. Not once, not twice, but many times she held over\nhis head the formidable menace of her imminent abdication. \"If England,\"\nshe wrote to Beaconsfield, \"is to kiss Russia's feet, she will not be a\nparty to the humiliation of England and would lay down her crown,\" and\nshe added that the Prime Minister might, if he thought fit, repeat her\nwords to the Cabinet. \"This delay,\" she ejaculated, \"this uncertainty by\nwhich, abroad, we are losing our prestige and our position, while Russia\nis advancing and will be before Constantinople in no time! Then the\nGovernment will be fearfully blamed and the Queen so humiliated that\nshe thinks she would abdicate at once. Be bold!\" \"She feels,\" she\nreiterated, \"she cannot, as she before said, remain the Sovereign of\na country that is letting itself down to kiss the feet of the great\nbarbarians, the retarders of all liberty and civilisation that exists.\"\nWhen the Russians advanced to the outskirts of Constantinople she fired\noff three letters in a day demanding war; and when she learnt that the\nCabinet had only decided to send the Fleet to Gallipoli she declared\nthat \"her first impulse\" was \"to lay down the thorny crown, which she\nfeels little satisfaction in retaining if the position of this country\nis to remain as it is now.\" It is easy to imagine the agitating effect\nof such a correspondence upon Beaconsfield. This was no longer the\nFaery; it was a genie whom he had rashly called out of her bottle, and",

      "text": "Ah! if only the Higher Classes would learn to live as she lived in the\ndomestic sobriety of her sanctuary at Balmoral! For more and more\ndid she find solace and refreshment in her Highland domain; and twice\nyearly, in the spring and in the autumn, with a sigh of relief, she set\nher face northwards, in spite of the humble protests of Ministers, who\nmurmured vainly in the royal ears that to transact the affairs of State\nover an interval of six hundred miles added considerably to the cares\nof government. Her ladies, too, felt occasionally a slight reluctance to\nset out, for, especially in the early days, the long pilgrimage was not\nwithout its drawbacks. For many years the Queen's conservatism forbade\nthe continuation of the railway up Deeside, so that the last stages\nof the journey had to be accomplished in carriages. But, after all,\ncarriages had their good points; they were easy, for instance, to get\nin and out of, which was an important consideration, for the royal train\nremained for long immune from modern conveniences, and when it drew up,\non some border moorland, far from any platform, the highbred dames were\nobliged to descend to earth by the perilous foot-board, the only pair\nof folding steps being reserved for Her Majesty's saloon. In the days of\ncrinolines such moments were sometimes awkward; and it was occasionally\nnecessary to summon Mr. Johnstone, the short and sturdy Manager of the\nCaledonian Railway, who, more than once, in a high gale and drenching\nrain with great difficulty \"pushed up\"--as he himself described it--some\nunlucky Lady Blanche or Lady Agatha into her compartment. But Victoria\ncared for none of these things. She was only intent upon regaining, with\nthe utmost swiftness, her enchanted Castle, where every spot was charged\nwith memories, where every memory was sacred, and where life was passed\nin an incessant and delightful round of absolutely trivial events.\nAnd it was not only the place that she loved; she was equally attached\nto \"the simple mountaineers,\" from whom, she said, \"she learnt many\na lesson of resignation and faith.\" Smith and Grant and Ross and\nThompson--she was devoted to them all; but, beyond the rest, she was\ndevoted to John Brown. The Prince's gillie had now become the Queen's\npersonal attendant--a body servant from whom she was never parted, who\naccompanied her on her drives, waited on her during the day, and\nslept in a neighbouring chamber at night. She liked his strength, his\nsolidity, the sense he gave her of physical security; she even liked his\nrugged manners and his rough unaccommodating speech. She allowed him to\ntake liberties with her which would have been unthinkable from anybody\nelse. To bully the Queen, to order her about, to reprimand her--who\ncould dream of venturing upon such audacities? And yet, when she\nreceived such treatment from John Brown, she positively seemed to enjoy\nit. The eccentricity appeared to be extraordinary; but, after all, it\nis no uncommon thing for an autocratic dowager to allow some trusted\nindispensable servant to adopt towards her an attitude of authority\nwhich is jealously forbidden to relatives or friends: the power of a\ndependent still remains, by a psychological sleight-of-hand, one's own\npower, even when it is exercised over oneself. When Victoria meekly\nobeyed the abrupt commands of her henchman to get off her pony or put on\nher shawl, was she not displaying, and in the highest degree, the force\nof her volition? People might wonder; she could not help that; this was\nthe manner in which it pleased her to act, and there was an end of it.\nTo have submitted her judgment to a son or a Minister might have seemed\nwiser or more natural; but if she had done so, she instinctively felt,\nshe would indeed have lost her independence. And yet upon somebody\nshe longed to depend. Her days were heavy with the long process of\ndomination. As she drove in silence over the moors she leaned back in\nthe carriage, oppressed and weary; but what a relief--John Brown was\nbehind on the rumble, and his strong arm would be there for her to lean\nupon when she got out.\nHe had, too, in her mind, a special connection with Albert. In their\nexpeditions the Prince had always trusted him more than anyone; the\ngruff, kind, hairy Scotsman was, she felt, in some mysterious way,\na legacy from the dead. She came to believe at last--or so it\nappeared--that the spirit of Albert was nearer when Brown was near.\nOften, when seeking inspiration over some complicated question of\npolitical or domestic import, she would gaze with deep concentration at\nher late husband's bust. But it was also noticed that sometimes in such\nmoments of doubt and hesitation Her Majesty's looks would fix themselves\nupon John Brown.",

      "text": "An event which occurred in 1882 revealed and accentuated the feelings of\nthe nation. As the Queen, at Windsor, was walking from the train to her\ncarriage, a youth named Roderick Maclean fired a pistol at her from a\ndistance of a few yards. An Eton boy struck up Maclean's arm with an\numbrella before the pistol went off; no damage was done, and the culprit\nwas at once arrested. This was the last of a series of seven attempts\nupon the Queen--attempts which, taking place at sporadic intervals over\na period of forty years, resembled one another in a curious manner. All,\nwith a single exception, were perpetrated by adolescents, whose motives\nwere apparently not murderous, since, save in the case of Maclean, none\nof their pistols was loaded. These unhappy youths, who, after buying\ntheir cheap weapons, stuffed them with gunpowder and paper, and then\nwent off, with the certainty of immediate detection, to click them in\nthe face of royalty, present a strange problem to the psychologist. But,\nthough in each case their actions and their purposes seemed to be so\nsimilar, their fates were remarkably varied. The first of them, Edward\nOxford, who fired at Victoria within a few months of her marriage, was\ntried for high treason, declared to be insane, and sent to an asylum for\nlife. It appears, however, that this sentence did not commend itself to\nAlbert, for when, two years later, John Francis committed the same of\nfence, and was tried upon the same charge, the Prince propounced that\nthere was no insanity in the matter. \"The wretched creature,\" he told\nhis father, was \"not out of his mind, but a thorough scamp.\" \"I hope,\"\nhe added, \"his trial will be conducted with the greatest strictness.\"\nApparently it was; at any rate, the jury shared the view of the Prince,\nthe plea of insanity was, set aside, and Francis was found guilty of\nhigh treason and condemned to death; but, as there was no proof of\nan intent to kill or even to wound, this sentence, after a lengthened\ndeliberation between the Home Secretary and the Judges, was commuted for\none of transportation for life. As the law stood, these assaults, futile\nas they were, could only be treated as high treason; the discrepancy\nbetween the actual deed and the tremendous penalties involved was\nobviously grotesque; and it was, besides, clear that a jury, knowing\nthat a verdict of guilty implied a sentence of death, would tend to\nthe alternative course, and find the prisoner not guilty but insane--a\nconclusion which, on the face of it, would have appeared to be the more\nreasonable. In 1842, therefore, an Act was passed making any attempt\nto hurt the Queen a misdemeanor, punishable by transportation for seven\nyears, or imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not\nexceeding three years--the misdemeanant, at the discretion of the Court,\n\"to be publicly or privately whipped, as often, and in such manner\nand form, as the Court shall direct, not exceeding thrice.\" The four\nsubsequent attempts were all dealt with under this new law; William\nBean, in 1842, was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment; William\nHamilton, in 1849, was transported for seven years; and, in 1850, the\nsame sentence was passed upon Lieutenant Robert Pate, who struck the\nQueen on the head with his cane in Piccadilly. Pate, alone among these\ndelinquents, was of mature years; he had held a commission in the Army,\ndressed himself as a dandy, and was, the Prince declared, \"manifestly\nderanged.\" In 1872 Arthur O'Connor, a youth of seventeen, fired\nan unloaded pistol at the Queen outside Buckingham Palace; he\nwas immediately seized by John Brown, and sentenced to one year's\nimprisonment and twenty strokes of the birch rod. It was for his bravery\nupon this occasion that Brown was presented with one of his gold medals.\nIn all these cases the jury had refused to allow the plea of insanity;\nbut Roderick Maclean's attempt in 1882 had a different issue. On this\noccasion the pistol was found to have been loaded, and the public\nindignation, emphasised as it was by Victoria's growing popularity,\nwas particularly great. Either for this or for some other reason the\nprocedure of the last forty years was abandoned, and Maclean was tried\nfor high treason. The result was what might have been expected: the jury\nbrought in a verdict of \"not guilty, but insane\"; and the prisoner was\nsent to an asylum during Her Majesty's pleasure. Their verdict, however,\nproduced a remarkable consequence. Victoria, who doubtless carried in\nher mind some memory of Albert's disapproval of a similar verdict in\nthe case of Oxford, was very much annoyed. What did the jury mean, she\nasked, by saying that Maclean was not guilty? It was perfectly clear\nthat he was guilty--she had seen him fire off the pistol herself. It was\nin vain that Her Majesty's constitutional advisers reminded her of the\nprinciple of English law which lays down that no man can be found\nguilty of a crime unless he be proved to have had a criminal intention.\nVictoria was quite unconvinced. \"If that is the law,\" she said, \"the law\nmust be altered:\" and altered it was. In 1883 an Act was passed changing\nthe form of the verdict in cases of insanity, and the confusing anomaly\nremains upon the Statute Book to this day.\nBut it was not only through the feelings--commiserating or indignant--of\npersonal sympathy that the Queen and her people were being drawn more",

      "text": "And so, after the toils and tempests of the day, a long evening\nfollowed--mild, serene, and lighted with a golden glory. For an\nunexampled atmosphere of success and adoration invested the last period\nof Victoria's life. Her triumph was the summary, the crown, of a greater\ntriumph--the culminating prosperity of a nation. The solid splendour of\nthe decade between Victoria's two jubilees can hardly be paralleled in\nthe annals of England. The sage counsels of Lord Salisbury seemed to\nbring with them not only wealth and power, but security; and the country\nsettled down, with calm assurance, to the enjoyment of an established\ngrandeur. And--it was only natural--Victoria settled down too. For\nshe was a part of the establishment--an essential part as it seemed--a\nfixture--a magnificent, immovable sideboard in the huge saloon of\nstate. Without her the heaped-up banquet of 1890 would have lost\nits distinctive quality--the comfortable order of the substantial\nunambiguous dishes, with their background of weighty glamour, half out\nof sight.\nHer own existence came to harmonise more and more with what was around\nher. Gradually, imperceptibly, Albert receded. It was not that he was\nforgotten--that would have been impossible--but that the void created\nby his absence grew less agonising, and even, at last, less obvious.\nAt last Victoria found it possible to regret the bad weather without\nimmediately reflecting that her \"dear Albert always said we could not\nalter it, but must leave it as it was;\" she could even enjoy a good\nbreakfast without considering how \"dear Albert\" would have liked the\nbuttered eggs. And, as that figure slowly faded, its place was taken,\ninevitably, by Victoria's own. Her being, revolving for so many years\nround an external object, now changed its motion and found its centre\nin itself. It had to be so: her domestic position, the pressure of\nher public work, her indomitable sense of duty, made anything else\nimpossible. Her egotism proclaimed its rights. Her age increased still\nfurther the surrounding deference; and her force of character, emerging\nat length in all its plenitude, imposed absolutely upon its environment\nby the conscious effort of an imperious will.\nLittle by little it was noticed that the outward vestiges of Albert's\nposthumous domination grew less complete. At Court the stringency of\nmourning was relaxed. As the Queen drove through the Park in her open\ncarriage with her Highlanders behind her, nursery-maids canvassed\neagerly the growing patch of violet velvet in the bonnet with its jet\nappurtenances on the small bowing head.\nIt was in her family that Victoria's ascendancy reached its highest\npoint. All her offspring were married; the number of her descendants\nrapidly increased; there were many marriages in the third generation;\nand no fewer than thirty-seven of her great-grandchildren were living at\nthe time of her death. A picture of the period displays the royal family\ncollected together in one of the great rooms at Windsor--a crowded\ncompany of more than fifty persons, with the imperial matriarch in\ntheir midst. Over them all she ruled with a most potent sway. The small\nconcerns of the youngest aroused her passionate interest; and the oldest\nshe treated as if they were children still. The Prince of Wales, in\nparticular, stood in tremendous awe of his mother. She had steadily\nrefused to allow him the slightest participation in the business of\ngovernment; and he had occupied himself in other ways. Nor could it\nbe denied that he enjoyed himself--out of her sight; but, in that\nredoubtable presence, his abounding manhood suffered a miserable\neclipse. Once, at Osborne, when, owing to no fault of his, he was too\nlate for a dinner party, he was observed standing behind a pillar and\nwiping the sweat from his forehead, trying to nerve himself to go up to\nthe Queen. When at last he did so, she gave him a stiff nod, whereupon\nhe vanished immediately behind another pillar, and remained there until\nthe party broke up. At the time of this incident the Prince of Wales was\nover fifty years of age.\nIt was inevitable that the Queen's domestic activities should\noccasionally trench upon the domain of high diplomacy; and this was\nespecially the case when the interests of her eldest daughter, the\nCrown Princess of Prussia, were at stake. The Crown Prince held liberal\nopinions; he was much influenced by his wife; and both were detested by\nBismarck, who declared with scurrilous emphasis that the Englishwoman\nand her mother were a menace to the Prussian State. The feud was still\nfurther intensified when, on the death of the old Emperor (1888), the\nCrown Prince succeeded to the throne. A family entanglement brought on\na violent crisis. One of the daughters of the new Empress had become\nbetrothed to Prince Alexander of Battenberg, who had lately been\nejected from the throne of Bulgaria owing to the hostility of the Tsar.\nVictoria, as well as the Empress, highly approved of the match. Of the\ntwo brothers of Prince Alexander, the elder had married another of her\ngrand-daughters, and the younger was the husband of her daughter, the\nPrincess Beatrice; she was devoted to the handsome young man; and she\nwas delighted by the prospect of the third brother--on the whole the\nhandsomest, she thought, of the three--also becoming a member of her\nfamily. Unfortunately, however, Bismarck was opposed to the scheme.\nHe perceived that the marriage would endanger the friendship between\nGermany and Russia, which was vital to his foreign policy, and he\nannounced that it must not take place. A fierce struggle between the\nEmpress and the Chancellor followed. Victoria, whose hatred of her\ndaughter's enemy was unbounded, came over to Charlottenburg to join in\nthe fray. Bismarck, over his pipe and lager, snorted out his alarm. The\nQueen of England's object, he said, was clearly political--she wished to\nestrange Germany and Russia--and very likely she would have her way. \"In\nfamily matters,\" he added, \"she is not used to contradiction;\" she would\n\"bring the parson with her in her travelling bag and the bridegroom in\nher trunk, and the marriage would come off on the spot.\" But the man\nof blood and iron was not to be thwarted so easily, and he asked for a\nprivate interview with the Queen. The details of their conversation are\nunknown; but it is certain that in the course of it Victoria was forced\nto realise the meaning of resistance to that formidable personage, and\nthat she promised to use all her influence to prevent the marriage. The\nengagement was broken off; and in the following year Prince Alexander of\nBattenberg united himself to Fraulein Loisinger, an actress at the court\ntheatre of Darmstad.\nBut such painful incidents were rare. Victoria was growing very old;\nwith no Albert to guide her, with no Beaconsfield to enflame her, she\nwas willing enough to abandon the dangerous questions of diplomacy\nto the wisdom of Lord Salisbury, and to concentrate her energies upon\nobjects which touched her more nearly and over which she could\nexercise an undisputed control. Her home--her court--the monuments\nat Balmoral--the livestock at Windsor--the organisation of her\nengagements--the supervision of the multitudinous details of her daily\nroutine--such matters played now an even greater part in her existence\nthan before. Her life passed in an extraordinary exactitude. Every\nmoment of her day was mapped out beforehand; the succession of her\nengagements was immutably fixed; the dates of her journeys--to Osborne,\nto Balmoral, to the South of France, to Windsor, to London--were hardly\naltered from year to year. She demanded from those who surrounded her\na rigid precision in details, and she was preternaturally quick in\ndetecting the slightest deviation from the rules which she had laid\ndown. Such was the irresistible potency of her personality, that\nanything but the most implicit obedience to her wishes was felt to be\nimpossible; but sometimes somebody was unpunctual; and unpunctuality\nwas one of the most heinous of sins. Then her displeasure--her dreadful\ndispleasure--became all too visible. At such moments there seemed\nnothing surprising in her having been the daughter of a martinet.\nBut these storms, unnerving as they were while they lasted, were quickly\nover, and they grew more and more exceptional. With the return of\nhappiness a gentle benignity flowed from the aged Queen. Her smile, once\nso rare a visitant to those saddened features, flitted over them with an\neasy alacrity; the blue eyes beamed; the whole face, starting suddenly\nfrom its pendulous expressionlessness, brightened and softened and cast\nover those who watched it an unforgettable charm. For in her last years\nthere was a fascination in Victoria's amiability which had been lacking\neven from the vivid impulse of her youth. Over all who approached\nher--or very nearly all--she threw a peculiar spell. Her grandchildren\nadored her; her ladies waited upon her with a reverential love. The\nhonour of serving her obliterated a thousand inconveniences--the\nmonotony of a court existence, the fatigue of standing, the necessity\nfor a superhuman attentiveness to the minutia: of time and space. As one\ndid one's wonderful duty one could forget that one's legs were aching\nfrom the infinitude of the passages at Windsor, or that one's bare arms\nwere turning blue in the Balmoral cold.",

Accordingly, every bed in which Victoria slept had\nattached to it, at the back, on the right-hand side, above the pillow,\na photograph of the head and shoulders of Albert as he lay dead,\nsurmounted by a wreath of immortelles. At Balmoral, where memories came\ncrowding so closely, the solid signs of memory appeared in surprising\nprofusion. Obelisks, pyramids, tombs, statues, cairns, and seats of\ninscribed granite, proclaimed Victoria's dedication to the dead. There,\ntwice a year, on the days that followed her arrival, a solemn\npilgrimage of inspection and meditation was performed. There, on August\n26--Albert's birthday--at the foot of the bronze statue of him in\nHighland dress, the Queen, her family, her Court, her servants, and her\ntenantry, met together and in silence drank to the memory of the dead.\nIn England the tokens of remembrance pullulated hardly less. Not a\nday passed without some addition to the multifold assemblage--a gold\nstatuette of Ross, the piper--a life-sized marble group of Victoria and\nAlbert, in medieval costume, inscribed upon the base with the words:\n\"Allured to brighter worlds and led the way-\" a granite slab in the\nshrubbery at Osborne, informing the visitor of \"Waldmann: the very\nfavourite little dachshund of Queen Victoria; who brought him from\nBaden, April 1872; died, July 11, 1881.\"\nAt Frogmore, the great mausoleum, perpetually enriched, was visited\nalmost daily by the Queen when the Court was at Windsor. But there was\nanother, a more secret and a hardly less holy shrine. The suite of rooms\nwhich Albert had occupied in the Castle was kept for ever shut away\nfrom the eyes of any save the most privileged. Within those precincts\neverything remained as it had been at the Prince's death; but the\nmysterious preoccupation of Victoria had commanded that her husband's\nclothing should be laid afresh, each evening, upon the bed, and that,\neach evening, the water should be set ready in the basin, as if he were",

      "text": "The final years were years of apotheosis. In the dazzled imagination\nof her subjects Victoria soared aloft towards the regions of divinity\nthrough a nimbus of purest glory. Criticism fell dumb; deficiencies\nwhich, twenty years earlier, would have been universally admitted, were\nnow as universally ignored. That the nation's idol was a very incomplete\nrepresentative of the nation was a circumstance that was hardly noticed,\nand yet it was conspicuously true. For the vast changes which, out of\nthe England of 1837, had produced the England of 1897, seemed scarcely\nto have touched the Queen. The immense industrial development of the\nperiod, the significance of which had been so thoroughly understood\nby Albert, meant little indeed to Victoria. The amazing scientific\nmovement, which Albert had appreciated no less, left Victoria perfectly\ncold. Her conception of the universe, and of man's place in it, and of\nthe stupendous problems of nature and philosophy remained, throughout\nher life, entirely unchanged. Her religion was the religion which she\nhad learnt from the Baroness Lehzen and the Duchess of Kent. Here, too,\nit might have been supposed that Albert's views might have influenced\nher. For Albert, in matters of religion, was advanced. Disbelieving\naltogether in evil spirits, he had had his doubts about the miracle\nof the Gaderene Swine. Stockmar, even, had thrown out, in a remarkable\nmemorandum on the education of the Prince of Wales, the suggestion that\nwhile the child \"must unquestionably be brought up in the creed of the\nChurch of England,\" it might nevertheless be in accordance with\nthe spirit of the times to exclude from his religious training the\ninculcation of a belief in \"the supernatural doctrines of Christianity.\"\nThis, however, would have been going too far; and all the royal children\nwere brought up in complete orthodoxy. Anything else would have grieved\nVictoria, though her own conceptions of the orthodox were not very\nprecise. But her nature, in which imagination and subtlety held so small\na place, made her instinctively recoil from the intricate ecstasies\nof High Anglicanism; and she seemed to feel most at home in the simple\nfaith of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. This was what might have\nbeen expected; for Lehzen was the daughter of a Lutheran pastor, and the\nLutherans and the Presbyterians have much in common. For many years Dr.\nNorman Macleod, an innocent Scotch minister, was her principal spiritual\nadviser; and, when he was taken from her, she drew much comfort from\nquiet chats about life and death with the cottagers at Balmoral.\nHer piety, absolutely genuine, found what it wanted in the sober\nexhortations of old John Grant and the devout saws of Mrs. P.\nFarquharson. They possessed the qualities, which, as a child of\nfourteen, she had so sincerely admired in the Bishop of Chester's\n\"Exposition of the Gospel of St. Matthew;\" they were \"just plain and\ncomprehensible and full of truth and good feeling.\" The Queen, who gave\nher name to the Age of Mill and of Darwin, never got any further than\nthat.\nFrom the social movements of her time Victoria was equally remote.\nTowards the smallest no less than towards the greatest changes she\nremained inflexible. During her youth and middle age smoking had been\nforbidden in polite society, and so long as she lived she would not\nwithdraw her anathema against it. Kings might protest; bishops and\nambassadors, invited to Windsor, might be reduced, in the privacy of\ntheir bedrooms, to lie full-length upon the floor and smoke up the\nchimney--the interdict continued! It might have been supposed that a\nfemale sovereign would have lent her countenance to one of the most\nvital of all the reforms to which her epoch gave birth--the emancipation\nof women--but, on the contrary, the mere mention of such a proposal sent\nthe blood rushing to her head. In 1870, her eye having fallen upon the\nreport of a meeting in favour of Women's Suffrage, she wrote to Mr.\nMartin in royal rage--\"The Queen is most anxious to enlist everyone\nwho can speak or write to join in checking this mad, wicked folly of\n'Woman's Rights,' with all its attendant horrors, on which her poor\nfeeble sex is bent, forgetting every sense of womanly feeling and\npropriety. Lady--ought to get a GOOD WHIPPING. It is a subject which\nmakes the Queen so furious that she cannot contain herself. God\ncreated men and women different--then let them remain each in their own\nposition. Tennyson has some beautiful lines on the difference of men and\nwomen in 'The Princess.' Woman would become the most hateful, heartless,\nand disgusting of human beings were she allowed to unsex herself; and\nwhere would be the protection which man was intended to give the weaker\nsex? The Queen is sure that Mrs. Martin agrees with her.\" The argument\nwas irrefutable; Mrs. Martin agreed; and yet the canker spread.\nIn another direction Victoria's comprehension of the spirit of her age\nhas been constantly asserted. It was for long the custom for courtly\nhistorians and polite politicians to compliment the Queen upon the\ncorrectness of her attitude towards the Constitution. But such praises\nseem hardly to be justified by the facts. In her later years Victoria\nmore than once alluded with regret to her conduct during the Bedchamber\ncrisis, and let it be understood that she had grown wiser since. Yet\nin truth it is difficult to trace any fundamental change either in her\ntheory or her practice in constitutional matters throughout her life.\nThe same despotic and personal spirit which led her to break off the\nnegotiations with Peel is equally visible in her animosity towards\nPalmerston, in her threats of abdication to Disraeli, and in her desire\nto prosecute the Duke of Westminster for attending a meeting upon\nBulgarian atrocities. The complex and delicate principles of the\nConstitution cannot be said to have come within the compass of her\nmental faculties; and in the actual developments which it underwent\nduring her reign she played a passive part. From 1840 to 1861 the\npower of the Crown steadily increased in England; from 1861 to 1901 it\nsteadily declined. The first process was due to the influence of the\nPrince Consort, the second to that of a series of great Ministers.\nDuring the first Victoria was in effect a mere accessory; during the\nsecond the threads of power, which Albert had so laboriously collected,\ninevitably fell from her hands into the vigorous grasp of Mr. Gladstone,\nLord Beaconsfield, and Lord Salisbury. Perhaps, absorbed as she was in\nroutine, and difficult as she found it to distinguish at all clearly\nbetween the trivial and the essential, she was only dimly aware of what\nwas happening. Yet, at the end of her reign, the Crown was weaker than\nat any other time in English history. Paradoxically enough, Victoria\nreceived the highest eulogiums for assenting to a political evolution,\nwhich, had she completely realised its import, would have filled her\nwith supreme displeasure.\nNevertheless it must not be supposed that she was a second George III.\nHer desire to impose her will, vehement as it was, and unlimited by any\nprinciple, was yet checked by a certain shrewdness. She might oppose\nher Ministers with extraordinary violence, she might remain utterly\nimpervious to arguments and supplications; the pertinacity of her\nresolution might seem to be unconquerable; but, at the very last moment\nof all, her obstinacy would give way. Her innate respect and capacity\nfor business, and perhaps, too, the memory of Albert's scrupulous\navoidance of extreme courses, prevented her from ever entering an\nimpasse. By instinct she understood when the facts were too much for\nher, and to them she invariably yielded. After all, what else could she\ndo?\nBut if, in all these ways, the Queen and her epoch were profoundly\nseparated, the points of contact between them also were not few.\nVictoria understood very well the meaning and the attractions of power\nand property, and in such learning the English nation, too, had grown\nto be more and more proficient. During the last fifteen years of the\nreign--for the short Liberal Administration of 1892 was a mere interlude\nimperialism was the dominant creed of the country. It was Victoria's\nas well. In this direction, if in no other, she had allowed her mind to\ndevelop. Under Disraeli's tutelage the British Dominions over the seas\nhad come to mean much more to her than ever before, and, in particular,\nshe had grown enamoured of the East. The thought of India fascinated\nher; she set to, and learnt a little Hindustani; she engaged some Indian\nservants, who became her inseparable attendants, and one of whom, Munshi\nAbdul Karim, eventually almost succeeded to the position which had\nonce been John Brown's. At the same time, the imperialist temper of the\nnation invested her office with a new significance exactly harmonising\nwith her own inmost proclivities. The English polity was in the main\na common-sense structure, but there was always a corner in it where\ncommon-sense could not enter--where, somehow or other, the ordinary\nmeasurements were not applicable and the ordinary rules did not apply.\nSo our ancestors had laid it down, giving scope, in their wisdom, to\nthat mystical element which, as it seems, can never quite be eradicated\nfrom the affairs of men. Naturally it was in the Crown that the\nmysticism of the English polity was concentrated--the Crown, with its\nvenerable antiquity, its sacred associations, its imposing spectacular\narray. But, for nearly two centuries, common-sense had been predominant\nin the great building, and the little, unexplored, inexplicable corner\nhad attracted small attention. Then, with the rise of imperialism, there\nwas a change. For imperialism is a faith as well as a business; as\nit grew, the mysticism in English public life grew with it; and\nsimultaneously a new importance began to attach to the Crown. The\nneed for a symbol--a symbol of England's might, of England's worth,\nof England's extraordinary and mysterious destiny--became felt more\nurgently than ever before. The Crown was that symbol: and the Crown\nrested upon the head of Victoria. Thus it happened that while by the end\nof the reign the power of the sovereign had appreciably diminished, the\nprestige of the sovereign had enormously grown.\nYet this prestige was not merely the outcome of public changes; it was\nan intensely personal matter, too. Victoria was the Queen of England,\nthe Empress of India, the quintessential pivot round which the whole\nmagnificent machine was revolving--but how much more besides! For one\nthing, she was of a great age--an almost indispensable qualification for\npopularity in England. She had given proof of one of the most admired\ncharacteristics of the race--persistent vitality. She had reigned for\nsixty years, and she was not out. And then, she was a character. The\noutlines of her nature were firmly drawn, and, even through the mists\nwhich envelop royalty, clearly visible. In the popular imagination her\nfamiliar figure filled, with satisfying ease, a distinct and memorable\nplace. It was, besides, the kind of figure which naturally called forth\nthe admiring sympathy of the great majority of the nation. Goodness they\nprized above every other human quality; and Victoria, who had said\nthat she would be good at the age of twelve, had kept her word. Duty,\nconscience, morality--yes! in the light of those high beacons the\nQueen had always lived. She had passed her days in work and not in\npleasure--in public responsibilities and family cares. The standard\nof solid virtue which had been set up so long ago amid the domestic\nhappiness of Osborne had never been lowered for an instant. For more\nthan half a century no divorced lady had approached the precincts of the\nCourt. Victoria, indeed, in her enthusiasm for wifely fidelity, had laid\ndown a still stricter ordinance: she frowned severely upon any widow\nwho married again. Considering that she herself was the offspring of\na widow's second marriage, this prohibition might be regarded as an\neccentricity; but, no doubt, it was an eccentricity on the right side.\nThe middle classes, firm in the triple brass of their respectability,\nrejoiced with a special joy over the most respectable of Queens. They\nalmost claimed her, indeed, as one of themselves; but this would have\nbeen an exaggeration. For, though many of her characteristics were most\noften found among the middle classes, in other respects--in her manners,\nfor instance--Victoria was decidedly aristocratic. And, in one important\nparticular, she was neither aristocratic nor middle-class: her attitude\ntoward herself was simply regal.\nSuch qualities were obvious and important; but, in the impact of a\npersonality, it is something deeper, something fundamental and common to\nall its qualities, that really tells. In Victoria, it is easy to discern\nthe nature of this underlying element: it was a peculiar sincerity. Her\ntruthfulness, her single-mindedness, the vividness of her emotions and\nher unrestrained expression of them, were the varied forms which this\ncentral characteristic assumed. It was her sincerity which gave her at\nonce her impressiveness, her charm, and her absurdity. She moved\nthrough life with the imposing certitude of one to whom concealment was\nimpossible--either towards her surroundings or towards herself. There\nshe was, all of her--the Queen of England, complete and obvious; the\nworld might take her or leave her; she had nothing more to show, or to\nexplain, or to modify; and, with her peerless carriage, she swept along\nher path. And not only was concealment out of the question; reticence,\nreserve, even dignity itself, as it sometimes seemed, might be very well\ndispensed with. As Lady Lyttelton said: \"There is a transparency in her\ntruth that is very striking--not a shade of exaggeration in describing\nfeelings or facts; like very few other people I ever knew. Many may be\nas true, but I think it goes often along with some reserve. She talks\nall out; just as it is, no more and no less.\" She talked all out; and\nshe wrote all out, too. Her letters, in the surprising jet of their\nexpression, remind one of a turned-on tap. What is within pours forth\nin an immediate, spontaneous rush. Her utterly unliterary style has at\nleast the merit of being a vehicle exactly suited to her thoughts and\nfeelings; and even the platitude of her phraseology carries with it a\ncuriously personal flavour. Undoubtedly it was through her writings that\nshe touched the heart of the public. Not only in her \"Highland Journals\"\nwhere the mild chronicle of her private proceedings was laid bare\nwithout a trace either of affectation or of embarrassment, but also in\nthose remarkable messages to the nation which, from time to time, she\npublished in the newspapers, her people found her very close to them\nindeed. They felt instinctively Victoria's irresistible sincerity, and\nthey responded. And in truth it was an endearing trait.\nThe personality and the position, too--the wonderful combination of\nthem--that, perhaps, was what was finally fascinating in the case. The\nlittle old lady, with her white hair and her plain mourning clothes,\nin her wheeled chair or her donkey-carriage--one saw her so; and\nthen--close behind--with their immediate suggestion of singularity,\nof mystery, and of power--the Indian servants. That was the familiar\nvision, and it was admirable; but, at chosen moments, it was right that\nthe widow of Windsor should step forth apparent Queen. The last and the\nmost glorious of such occasions was the Jubilee of 1897. Then, as\nthe splendid procession passed along, escorting Victoria through the\nthronged re-echoing streets of London on her progress of thanksgiving\nto St. Paul's Cathedral, the greatness of her realm and the adoration\nof her subjects blazed out together. The tears welled to her eyes, and,\nwhile the multitude roared round her, \"How kind they are to me! How kind\nthey are!\" she repeated over and over again. That night her message flew\nover the Empire: \"From my heart I thank my beloved people. May God bless\nthem!\" The long journey was nearly done. But the traveller, who had\ncome so far, and through such strange experiences, moved on with the\nold unfaltering step. The girl, the wife, the aged woman, were the same:\nvitality, conscientiousness, pride, and simplicity were hers to the\nlatest hour.",
