            "text": "On November 6, 1817, died the Princess Charlotte, only child of the\nPrince Regent, and heir to the crown of England. Her short life had\nhardly been a happy one. By nature impulsive, capricious, and vehement,\nshe had always longed for liberty; and she had never possessed it.\nShe had been brought up among violent family quarrels, had been early\nseparated from her disreputable and eccentric mother, and handed over to\nthe care of her disreputable and selfish father. When she was seventeen,\nhe decided to marry her off to the Prince of Orange; she, at first,\nacquiesced; but, suddenly falling in love with Prince Augustus of\nPrussia, she determined to break off the engagement. This was not her\nfirst love affair, for she had previously carried on a clandestine\ncorrespondence with a Captain Hess. Prince Augustus was already married,\nmorganatically, but she did not know it, and he did not tell her. While\nshe was spinning out the negotiations with the Prince of Orange, the\nallied sovereign--it was June, 1814--arrived in London to celebrate\ntheir victory. Among them, in the suite of the Emperor of Russia, was\nthe young and handsome Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. He made several\nattempts to attract the notice of the Princess, but she, with her heart\nelsewhere, paid very little attention. Next month the Prince Regent,\ndiscovering that his daughter was having secret meetings with Prince\nAugustus, suddenly appeared upon the scene and, after dismissing her\nhousehold, sentenced her to a strict seclusion in Windsor Park. \"God\nAlmighty grant me patience!\" she exclaimed, falling on her knees in an\nagony of agitation: then she jumped up, ran down the backstairs and out\ninto the street, hailed a passing cab, and drove to her mother's house\nin Bayswater. She was discovered, pursued, and at length, yielding\nto the persuasions of her uncles, the Dukes of York and Sussex, of\nBrougham, and of the Bishop of Salisbury, she returned to Carlton House\nat two o'clock in the morning. She was immured at Windsor, but no more\nwas heard of the Prince of Orange. Prince Augustus, too, disappeared.\nThe way was at last open to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.\nThis Prince was clever enough to get round the Regent, to impress the\nMinisters, and to make friends with another of the Princess's uncles,\nthe Duke of Kent. Through the Duke he was able to communicate privately\nwith the Princess, who now declared that he was necessary to\nher happiness. When, after Waterloo, he was in Paris, the Duke's\naide-de-camp carried letters backwards and forwards across the Channel.\nIn January 1816 he was invited to England, and in May the marriage took\nplace.\nThe character of Prince Leopold contrasted strangely with that of\nhis wife. The younger son of a German princeling, he was at this time\ntwenty-six years of age; he had served with distinction in the war\nagainst Napoleon; he had shown considerable diplomatic skill at the\nCongress of Vienna; and he was now to try his hand at the task of taming\na tumultuous Princess. Cold and formal in manner, collected in speech,\ncareful in action, he soon dominated the wild, impetuous, generous\ncreature by his side. There was much in her, he found, of which he could\nnot approve. She quizzed, she stamped, she roared with laughter; she\nhad very little of that self-command which is especially required of\nprinces; her manners were abominable. Of the latter he was a good judge,\nhaving moved, as he himself explained to his niece many years later, in\nthe best society of Europe, being in fact \"what is called in French de\nla fleur des pois.\" There was continual friction, but every scene\nended in the same way. Standing before him like a rebellious boy in\npetticoats, her body pushed forward, her hands behind her back, with\nflaming cheeks and sparkling eyes, she would declare at last that she\nwas ready to do whatever he wanted. \"If you wish it, I will do it,\" she\nwould say. \"I want nothing for myself,\" he invariably answered; \"When\nI press something on you, it is from a conviction that it is for your\ninterest and for your good.\"\nAmong the members of the household at Claremont, near Esher, where the\nroyal pair were established, was a young German physician, Christian\nFriedrich Stockmar. He was the son of a minor magistrate in Coburg, and,\nafter taking part as a medical officer in the war, he had settled down\nas a doctor in his native town. Here he had met Prince Leopold, who had\nbeen struck by his ability, and, on his marriage, brought him to England\nas his personal physician. A curious fate awaited this young man;\nmany were the gifts which the future held in store for him--many and\nvarious--influence, power, mystery, unhappiness, a broken heart. At\nClaremont his position was a very humble one; but the Princess took\na fancy to him, called him \"Stocky,\" and romped with him along the\ncorridors. Dyspeptic by constitution, melancholic by temperament, he\ncould yet be lively on occasion, and was known as a wit in Coburg. He\nwas virtuous, too, and served the royal menage with approbation. \"My\nmaster,\" he wrote in his diary, \"is the best of all husbands in all the\nfive quarters of the globe; and his wife bears him an amount of love,\nthe greatness of which can only be compared with the English national\ndebt.\" Before long he gave proof of another quality--a quality which was\nto colour the whole of his life-cautious sagacity. When, in the spring\nof 1817, it was known that the Princess was expecting a child, the post\nof one of her physicians-in-ordinary was offered to him, and he had\nthe good sense to refuse it. He perceived that his colleagues would be\njealous of him, that his advice would probably not be taken, but that,\nif anything were to go wrong, it would be certainly the foreign doctor\nwho would be blamed. Very soon, indeed, he came to the opinion that the\nlow diet and constant bleedings, to which the unfortunate Princess was\nsubjected, were an error; he drew the Prince aside, and begged him to\ncommunicate this opinion to the English doctors; but it was useless. The\nfashionable lowering treatment was continued for months. On November 5,\nat nine o'clock in the evening, after a labour of over fifty hours, the\nPrincess was delivered of a dead boy. At midnight her exhausted strength\ngave way. When, at last, Stockmar consented to see her; he went in, and\nfound her obviously dying, while the doctors were plying her with wine.\nShe seized his hand and pressed it. \"They have made me tipsy,\" she said.\nAfter a little he left her, and was already in the next room when he\nheard her call out in her loud voice: \"Stocky! Stocky!\" As he ran back\nthe death-rattle was in her throat. She tossed herself violently from\nside to side; then suddenly drew up her legs, and it was over.\nThe Prince, after hours of watching, had left the room for a few\nmoments' rest; and Stockmar had now to tell him that his wife was dead.",

            "text": "The tragedy at Claremont was of a most upsetting kind. The royal\nkaleidoscope had suddenly shifted, and nobody could tell how the new\npattern would arrange itself. The succession to the throne, which had\nseemed so satisfactorily settled, now became a matter of urgent doubt.\nGeorge III was still living, an aged lunatic, at Windsor, completely\nimpervious to the impressions of the outer world. Of his seven sons, the\nyoungest was of more than middle age, and none had legitimate offspring.\nThe outlook, therefore, was ambiguous. It seemed highly improbable that\nthe Prince Regent, who had lately been obliged to abandon his stays, and\npresented a preposterous figure of debauched obesity, could ever again,\neven on the supposition that he divorced his wife and re-married, become\nthe father of a family. Besides the Duke of Kent, who must be noticed\nseparately, the other brothers, in order of seniority, were the Dukes of\nYork, Clarence, Cumberland, Sussex, and Cambridge; their situations and\nprospects require a brief description. The Duke of York, whose escapades\nin times past with Mrs. Clarke and the army had brought him into\ntrouble, now divided his life between London and a large, extravagantly\nordered and extremely uncomfortable country house where he occupied\nhimself with racing, whist, and improper stories. He was remarkable\namong the princes for one reason: he was the only one of them--so we\nare informed by a highly competent observer--who had the feelings of a\ngentleman. He had been long married to the Princess Royal of Prussia,\na lady who rarely went to bed and was perpetually surrounded by vast\nnumbers of dogs, parrots, and monkeys. They had no children. The Duke\nof Clarence had lived for many years in complete obscurity with Mrs.\nJordan, the actress, in Bushey Park. By her he had had a large family\nof sons and daughters, and had appeared, in effect to be married to her,\nwhen he suddenly separated from her and offered to marry Miss Wykeham, a\ncrazy woman of large fortune, who, however, would have nothing to say to\nhim. Shortly afterwards Mrs. Jordan died in distressed circumstances\nin Paris. The Duke of Cumberland was probably the most unpopular man in\nEngland. Hideously ugly, with a distorted eye, he was bad-tempered\nand vindictive in private, a violent reactionary in politics, and was\nsubsequently suspected of murdering his valet and of having carried\non an amorous intrigue of an extremely scandalous kind. He had lately\nmarried a German Princess, but there were as yet no children by the\nmarriage. The Duke of Sussex had mildly literary tastes and collected\nbooks. He had married Lady Augusta Murray, by whom he had two children,\nbut the marriage, under the Royal Marriages Act, was declared void. On\nLady Augusta's death, he married Lady Cecilia Buggin; she changed her\nname to Underwood, but this marriage also was void. Of the Duke of\nCambridge, the youngest of the brothers, not very much was known. He\nlived in Hanover, wore a blonde wig, chattered and fidgeted a great\ndeal, and was unmarried.\nBesides his seven sons, George III had five surviving daughters. Of\nthese, two--the Queen of Wurtemberg and the Duchess of Gloucester--were\nmarried and childless. The three unmarried princesses--Augusta,\nElizabeth, and Sophia--were all over forty.",

            "text": "The fourth son of George III was Edward, Duke of Kent. He was now fifty\nyears of age--a tall, stout, vigorous man, highly-coloured, with bushy\neyebrows, a bald top to his head, and what hair he had carefully dyed a\nglossy black. His dress was extremely neat, and in his whole appearance\nthere was a rigidity which did not belie his character. He had spent\nhis early life in the army--at Gibraltar, in Canada, in the West\nIndies--and, under the influence of military training, had become at\nfirst a disciplinarian and at last a martinet. In 1802, having been sent\nto Gibraltar to restore order in a mutinous garrison, he was recalled\nfor undue severity, and his active career had come to an end. Since then\nhe had spent his life regulating his domestic arrangements with great\nexactitude, busying himself with the affairs of his numerous dependents,\ndesigning clocks, and struggling to restore order to his finances, for,\nin spite of his being, as someone said who knew him well \"regle comme du\npapier a musique,\" and in spite of an income of L24,000 a year, he\nwas hopelessly in debt. He had quarrelled with most of his brothers,\nparticularly with the Prince Regent, and it was only natural that he\nshould have joined the political Opposition and become a pillar of the\nWhigs.\nWhat his political opinions may actually have been is open to doubt; it\nhas often been asserted that he was a Liberal, or even a Radical; and,\nif we are to believe Robert Owen, he was a necessitarian Socialist. His\nrelations with Owen--the shrewd, gullible, high-minded, wrong-headed,\nillustrious and preposterous father of Socialism and Co-operation--were\ncurious and characteristic. He talked of visiting the Mills at New\nLanark, he did, in fact, preside at one of Owen's public meetings;\nhe corresponded with him on confidential terms, and he even (so Owen\nassures us) returned, after his death, from \"the sphere of spirits\" to\ngive encouragement to the Owenites on earth. \"In an especial manner,\"\nsays Owen, \"I have to name the very anxious feelings of the spirit of\nhis Royal Highness the Late Duke of Kent (who early informed me\nthat there were no titles in the spititual spheres into which he had\nentered), to benefit, not a class, a sect, a party, or any particular\ncountry, but the whole of the human race, through futurity.\" \"His whole\nspirit-proceeding with me has been most beautiful,\" Owen adds, \"making\nhis own appointments; and never in one instance has this spirit not\nbeen punctual to the minute he had named.\" But Owen was of a sanguine\ntemperament. He also numbered among his proselytes President Jefferson,\nPrince Metternich, and Napoleon; so that some uncertainty must still\nlinger over the Duke of Kent's views. But there is no uncertainty about\nanother circumstance: his Royal Highness borrowed from Robert Owen, on\nvarious occasions, various sums of money which were never repaid and\namounted in all to several hundred pounds.\nAfter the death of the Princess Charlotte it was clearly important, for\nmore than one reason, that the Duke of Kent should marry. From the point\nof view of the nation, the lack of heirs in the reigning family seemed\nto make the step almost obligatory; it was also likely to be highly\nexpedient from the point of view of the Duke. To marry as a public\nduty, for the sake of the royal succession, would surely deserve some\nrecognition from a grateful country. When the Duke of York had married\nhe had received a settlement of L25,000 a year. Why should not the Duke\nof Kent look forward to an equal sum? But the situation was not quite\nsimple. There was the Duke of Clarence to be considered; he was the\nelder brother, and, if HE married, would clearly have the prior claim.\nOn the other hand, if the Duke of Kent married, it was important\nto remember that he would be making a serious sacrifice: a lady was\ninvolved.\nThe Duke, reflecting upon all these matters with careful attention,\nhappened, about a month after his niece's death, to visit Brussels, and\nlearnt that Mr. Creevey was staying in the town. Mr. Creevey was a close\nfriend of the leading Whigs and an inveterate gossip; and it occurred\nto the Duke that there could be no better channel through which to\ncommunicate his views upon the situation to political circles at home.\nApparently it did not occur to him that Mr. Creevey was malicious and\nmight keep a diary. He therefore sent for him on some trivial pretext,\nand a remarkable conversation ensued.\nAfter referring to the death of the Princess, to the improbability of\nthe Regent's seeking a divorce, to the childlessness of the Duke of\nYork, and to the possibility of the Duke of Clarence marrying, the Duke\nadverted to his own position. \"Should the Duke of Clarence not marry,\"\nhe said, \"the next prince in succession is myself, and although I trust\nI shall be at all times ready to obey any call my country may make upon\nme, God only knows the sacrifice it will be to make, whenever I shall\nthink it my duty to become a married man. It is now seven and twenty\nyears that Madame St. Laurent and I have lived together: we are of\nthe same age, and have been in all climates, and in all difficulties\ntogether, and you may well imagine, Mr. Creevey, the pang it will\noccasion me to part with her. I put it to your own feelings--in the\nevent of any separation between you and Mrs. Creevey... As for Madame\nSt. Laurent herself, I protest I don't know what is to become of her if\na marriage is to be forced upon me; her feelings are already so agitated\nupon the subject.\" The Duke went on to describe how, one morning, a day\nor two after the Princess Charlotte's death, a paragraph had appeared in\nthe Morning Chronicle, alluding to the possibility of his marriage. He\nhad received the newspaper at breakfast together with his letters, and\n\"I did as is my constant practice, I threw the newspaper across the\ntable to Madame St. Laurent, and began to open and read my letters. I\nhad not done so but a very short time, when my attention was called to\nan extraordinary noise and a strong convulsive movement in Madame St.\nLaurent's throat. For a short time I entertained serious apprehensions\nfor her safety; and when, upon her recovery, I enquired into the\noccasion of this attack, she pointed to the article in the Morning\nChronicle.\"\nThe Duke then returned to the subject of the Duke of Clarence. \"My\nbrother the Duke of Clarence is the elder brother, and has certainly the\nright to marry if he chooses, and I would not interfere with him on any\naccount. If he wishes to be king--to be married and have children, poor\nman--God help him! Let him do so. For myself--I am a man of no ambition,\nand wish only to remain as I am... Easter, you know, falls very early\nthis year--the 22nd of March. If the Duke of Clarence does not take any\nstep before that time, I must find some pretext to reconcile Madame St.\nLaurent to my going to England for a short time. When once there, it\nwill be easy for me to consult with my friends as to the proper steps to\nbe taken. Should the Duke of Clarence do nothing before that time as to\nmarrying it will become my duty, no doubt, to take some measures upon\nthe subject myself.\" Two names, the Duke said, had been mentioned in\nthis connection--those of the Princess of Baden and the Princess of\nSaxe-Coburg. The latter, he thought, would perhaps be the better of the\ntwo, from the circumstance of Prince Leopold being so popular with the\nnation; but before any other steps were taken, he hoped and expected to\nsee justice done to Madame St. Laurent. \"She is,\" he explained, \"of very\ngood family, and has never been an actress, and I am the first and only\nperson who ever lived with her. Her disinterestedness, too, has been\nequal to her fidelity. When she first came to me it was upon L100 a\nyear. That sum was afterwards raised to L400 and finally to L1000; but\nwhen my debts made it necessary for me to sacrifice a great part of my\nincome, Madame St. Laurent insisted upon again returning to her income\nof L400 a year. If Madame St. Laurent is to return to live amongst her\nfriends, it must be in such a state of independence as to command their\nrespect. I shall not require very much, but a certain number of servants\nand a carriage are essentials.\" As to his own settlement, the Duke\nobserved that he would expect the Duke of York's marriage to be\nconsidered the precedent. \"That,\" he said, \"was a marriage for the\nsuccession, and L25,000 for income was settled, in addition to all his\nother income, purely on that account. I shall be contented with the same\narrangement, without making any demands grounded on the difference of\nthe value of money in 1792 and at present. As for the payment of my\ndebts,\" the Duke concluded, \"I don't call them great. The nation, on\nthe contrary, is greatly my debtor.\" Here a clock struck, and seemed\nto remind the Duke that he had an appointment; he rose, and Mr. Creevey\nleft him.\nWho could keep such a communication secret? Certainly not Mr. Creevey.",

            "text": "The new Duchess of Kent, Victoria Mary Louisa, was a daughter of\nFrancis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and a sister of Prince Leopold.\nThe family was an ancient one, being a branch of the great House of\nWettin, which since the eleventh century had ruled over the March of\nMeissen on the Elbe. In the fifteenth century the whole possessions of\nthe House had been divided between the Albertine and Ernestine branches:\nfrom the former descended the electors and kings of Saxony; the latter,\nruling over Thuringia, became further subdivided into five branches,\nof which the duchy of Saxe-Coburg was one. This principality was very\nsmall, containing about 60,000 inhabitants, but it enjoyed independent\nand sovereign rights. During the disturbed years which followed the\nFrench Revolution, its affairs became terribly involved. The Duke was\nextravagant, and kept open house for the swarms of refugees, who fled\neastward over Germany as the French power advanced. Among these was the\nPrince of Leiningen, an elderly beau, whose domains on the Moselle\nhad been seized by the French, but who was granted in compensation\nthe territory of Amorbach in Lower Franconia. In 1803 he married the\nPrincess Victoria, at that time seventeen years of age. Three years\nlater Duke Francis died a ruined man. The Napoleonic harrow passed over\nSaxe-Coburg. The duchy was seized by the French, and the ducal family\nwere reduced to beggary, almost to starvation. At the same time the\nlittle principality of Amorbach was devastated by the French, Russian,\nand Austrian armies, marching and counter-marching across it. For years\nthere was hardly a cow in the country, nor enough grass to feed a\nflock of geese. Such was the desperate plight of the family which, a\ngeneration later, was to have gained a foothold in half the reigning\nHouses of Europe. The Napoleonic harrow had indeed done its work, the\nseed was planted; and the crop would have surprised Napoleon. Prince\nLeopold, thrown upon his own resources at fifteen, made a career for\nhimself and married the heiress of England. The Princess of Leiningen,\nstruggling at Amorbach with poverty, military requisitions, and a\nfutile husband, developed an independence of character and a tenacity of\npurpose which were to prove useful in very different circumstances. In\n1814, her husband died, leaving her with two children and the regency\nof the principality. After her brother's marriage with the Princess\nCharlotte, it was proposed that she should marry the Duke of Kent; but\nshe declined, on the ground that the guardianship of her children and\nthe management of her domains made other ties undesirable. The Princess\nCharlotte's death, however, altered the case; and when the Duke of Kent\nrenewed his offer, she accepted it. She was thirty-two years old--short,\nstout, with brown eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, cheerful and voluble,\nand gorgeously attired in rustling silks and bright velvets.\nShe was certainly fortunate in her contented disposition; for she was\nfated, all through her life, to have much to put up with. Her second\nmarriage, with its dubious prospects, seemed at first to be chiefly a\nsource of difficulties and discomforts. The Duke, declaring that he was\nstill too poor to live in England, moved about with uneasy precision\nthrough Belgium and Germany, attending parades and inspecting barracks\nin a neat military cap, while the English notabilities looked askance,\nand the Duke of Wellington dubbed him the Corporal. \"God damme!\" he\nexclaimed to Mr. Creevey, \"d'ye know what his sisters call him? By God!\nthey call him Joseph Surface!\" At Valenciennes, where there was a\nreview and a great dinner, the Duchess arrived with an old and\nugly lady-in-waiting, and the Duke of Wellington found himself in a\ndifficulty. \"Who the devil is to take out the maid of honour?\" he kept\nasking; but at last he thought of a solution. \"Damme, Freemantle, find\nout the mayor and let him do it.\" So the Mayor of Valenciennes was\nbrought up for the purpose, and--so we learn from Mr. Creevey--\"a\ncapital figure he was.\" A few days later, at Brussels, Mr. Creevey\nhimself had an unfortunate experience. A military school was to be\ninspected--before breakfast. The company assembled; everything was\nhighly satisfactory; but the Duke of Kent continued for so long\nexamining every detail and asking meticulous question after meticulous\nquestion, that Mr. Creevey at last could bear it no longer, and\nwhispered to his neighbour that he was damned hungry. The Duke of\nWellington heard him, and was delighted. \"I recommend you,\" he said,\n\"whenever you start with the royal family in a morning, and particularly\nwith THE CORPORAL, always to breakfast first.\" He and his staff, it\nturned out, had taken that precaution, and the great man amused himself,\nwhile the stream of royal inquiries poured on, by pointing at Mr.\nCreevey from time to time with the remark, \"Voila le monsieur qui n'a\npas dejeune!\"\nSettled down at last at Amorbach, the time hung heavily on the Duke's\nhands. The establishment was small, the country was impoverished; even\nclock-making grew tedious at last. He brooded--for in spite of his piety\nthe Duke was not without a vein of superstition--over the prophecy of\na gipsy at Gibraltar who told him that he was to have many losses and\ncrosses, that he was to die in happiness, and that his only child was\nto be a great queen. Before long it became clear that a child was to be\nexpected: the Duke decided that it should be born in England. Funds were\nlacking for the journey, but his determination was not to be set aside.\nCome what might, he declared, his child must be English-born. A carriage\nwas hired, and the Duke himself mounted the box. Inside were the\nDuchess, her daughter Feodora, a girl of fourteen, with maids, nurses,\nlap-dogs, and canaries. Off they drove--through Germany, through\nFrance: bad roads, cheap inns, were nothing to the rigorous Duke and the\nequable, abundant Duchess. The Channel was crossed, London was reached\nin safety. The authorities provided a set of rooms in Kensington Palace;\nand there, on May 24, 1819, a female infant was born.",

The Duchess of Clarence, two months before,\nhad given birth to a daughter, this infant, indeed, had died almost\nimmediately; but it seemed highly probable that the Duchess would\nagain become a mother; and so it actually fell out. More than this,\nthe Duchess of Kent was young, and the Duke was strong; there was every\nlikelihood that before long a brother would follow, to snatch her faint\nchance of the succession from the little princess.\nNevertheless, the Duke had other views: there were prophecies... At any\nrate, he would christen the child Elizabeth, a name of happy augury. In\nthis, however, he reckoned without the Regent, who, seeing a chance\nof annoying his brother, suddenly announced that he himself would be\npresent at the baptism, and signified at the same time that one of the\ngodfathers was to be the Emperor Alexander of Russia. And so when the\nceremony took place, and the Archbishop of Canterbury asked by what name\nhe was to baptise the child, the Regent replied \"Alexandria.\" At\nthis the Duke ventured to suggest that another name might be added.\n\"Certainly,\" said the Regent; \"Georgina?\" \"Or Elizabeth?\" said the Duke.\nThere was a pause, during which the Archbishop, with the baby in his\nlawn sleeves, looked with some uneasiness from one Prince to the other.\n\"Very well, then,\" said the Regent at last, \"call her after her mother.\nBut Alexandrina must come first.\" Thus, to the disgust of her father,\nthe child was christened Alexandrina Victoria.",

            "text": "The child herself was extremely fat, and bore a remarkable resemblance\nto her grandfather. \"C'est l'image du feu Roi!\" exclaimed the Duchess.\n\"C'est le Roi Georges en jupons,\" echoed the surrounding ladies, as the\nlittle creature waddled with difficulty from one to the other.\nBefore long, the world began to be slightly interested in the nursery at\nKensington. When, early in 1821, the Duchess of Clarence's second child,\nthe Princess Elizabeth, died within three months of its birth, the\ninterest increased. Great forces and fierce antagonisms seemed to be\nmoving, obscurely, about the royal cradle. It was a time of faction\nand anger, of violent repression and profound discontent. A powerful\nmovement, which had for long been checked by adverse circumstances, was\nnow spreading throughout the country. New passions, new desires, were\nabroad; or rather old passions and old desires, reincarnated with a new\npotency: love of freedom, hatred of injustice, hope for the future\nof man. The mighty still sat proudly in their seats, dispensing their\nancient tyranny; but a storm was gathering out of the darkness, and\nalready there was lightning in the sky. But the vastest forces must\nneeds operate through frail human instruments; and it seemed for many\nyears as if the great cause of English liberalism hung upon the life of\nthe little girl at Kensington. She alone stood between the country and\nher terrible uncle, the Duke of Cumberland, the hideous embodiment of\nreaction. Inevitably, the Duchess of Kent threw in her lot with her\nhusband's party; Whig leaders, Radical agitators, rallied round her; she\nwas intimate with the bold Lord Durham, she was on friendly terms with\nthe redoubtable O'Connell himself. She received Wilberforce-though, to\nbe sure, she did not ask him to sit down. She declared in public that\nshe put her faith in \"the liberties of the People.\" It was certain that\nthe young Princess would be brought up in the way that she should go;\nyet there, close behind the throne, waiting, sinister, was the Duke of\nCumberland. Brougham, looking forward into the future in his scurrilous\nfashion, hinted at dreadful possibilities. \"I never prayed so heartily\nfor a Prince before,\" he wrote, on hearing that George IV had been\nattacked by illness. \"If he had gone, all the troubles of these villains\n(the Tory Ministers) went with him, and they had Fred. I (the Duke of\nYork) their own man for his life. He (Fred. I) won't live long either;\nthat Prince of Blackguards, 'Brother William,' is as bad a life, so\nwe come in the course of nature to be ASSASSINATED by King Ernest I or\nRegent Ernest (the Duke of Cumberland).\" Such thoughts were not peculiar\nto Brougham; in the seething state of public feeling, they constantly\nleapt to the surface; and, even so late as the year previous to her\naccession, the Radical newspapers were full of suggestions that the\nPrincess Victoria was in danger from the machinations of her wicked\nuncle.\nBut no echo of these conflicts and forebodings reached the little\nDrina--for so she was called in the family circle--as she played with\nher dolls, or scampered down the passages, or rode on the donkey her\nuncle York had given her along the avenues of Kensington Gardens\nThe fair-haired, blue-eyed child was idolised by her nurses, and her\nmother's ladies, and her sister Feodora; and for a few years there was",

The centre of gravity in the constitution\nwas shifted towards the middle classes; the Whigs came into power; and\nthe complexion of the Government assumed a Liberal tinge. One of the\nresults of this new state of affairs was a change in the position of\nthe Duchess of Kent and her daughter.

            "text": "The King had prayed that he might live till his niece was of age; and\na few days before her eighteenth birthday--the date of her legal\nmajority--a sudden attack of illness very nearly carried him off. He\nrecovered, however, and the Princess was able to go through her\nbirthday festivities--a state ball and a drawing-room--with unperturbed\nenjoyment. \"Count Zichy,\" she noted in her diary, \"is very good-looking\nin uniform, but not in plain clothes. Count Waldstein looks remarkably\nwell in his pretty Hungarian uniform.\" With the latter young gentleman\nshe wished to dance, but there was an insurmountable difficulty. \"He\ncould not dance quadrilles, and, as in my station I unfortunately cannot\nvalse and gallop, I could not dance with him.\" Her birthday present\nfrom the King was of a pleasing nature, but it led to a painful domestic\nscene. In spite of the anger of her Belgian uncle, she had remained upon\ngood terms with her English one. He had always been very kind to her,\nand the fact that he had quarrelled with her mother did not appear to\nbe a reason for disliking him. He was, she said, \"odd, very odd and\nsingular,\" but \"his intentions were often ill interpreted.\" He now wrote\nher a letter, offering her an allowance of L10,000 a year, which he\nproposed should be at her own disposal, and independent of her mother.\nLord Conyngham, the Lord Chamberlain, was instructed to deliver the\nletter into the Princess's own hands. When he arrived at Kensington, he\nwas ushered into the presence of the Duchess and the Princess, and, when\nhe produced the letter, the Duchess put out her hand to take it. Lord\nConyngham begged her Royal Highness's pardon, and repeated the King's\ncommands. Thereupon the Duchess drew back, and the Princess took the\nletter. She immediately wrote to her uncle, accepting his kind proposal.\nThe Duchess was much displeased; L4000 a year, she said, would be quite\nenough for Victoria; as for the remaining L6000, it would be only proper\nthat she should have that herself.\nKing William had thrown off his illness, and returned to his normal\nlife. Once more the royal circle at Windsor--their Majesties, the elder\nPrincesses, and some unfortunate Ambassadress or Minister's wife--might\nbe seen ranged for hours round a mahogany table, while the Queen netted\na purse, and the King slept, occasionally waking from his slumbers to\nobserve \"Exactly so, ma'am, exactly so!\" But this recovery was of short\nduration. The old man suddenly collapsed; with no specific symptoms\nbesides an extreme weakness, he yet showed no power of rallying; and it\nwas clear to everyone that his death was now close at hand.\nAll eyes, all thoughts, turned towards the Princess Victoria; but she\nstill remained, shut away in the seclusion of Kensington, a small,\nunknown figure, lost in the large shadow of her mother's domination. The\npreceding year had in fact been an important one in her development. The\nsoft tendrils of her mind had for the first time begun to stretch out\ntowards unchildish things. In this King Leopold encouraged her. After\nhis return to Brussels, he had resumed his correspondance in a more\nserious strain; he discussed the details of foreign politics; he laid\ndown the duties of kingship; he pointed out the iniquitous foolishness\nof the newspaper press. On the latter subject, indeed, he wrote with\nsome asperity. \"If all the editors,\" he said, \"of the papers in the\ncountries where the liberty of the press exists were to be assembled, we\nshould have a crew to which you would NOT confide a dog that you would\nvalue, still less your honour and reputation.\" On the functions of a\nmonarch, his views were unexceptionable. \"The business of the highest\nin a State,\" he wrote, \"is certainly, in my opinion, to act with great\nimpartiality and a spirit of justice for the good of all.\" At the\nsame time the Princess's tastes were opening out. Though she was still\npassionately devoted to riding and dancing, she now began to have a\ngenuine love of music as well, and to drink in the roulades and arias\nof the Italian opera with high enthusiasm. She even enjoyed reading\npoetry--at any rate, the poetry of Sir Walter Scott.\nWhen King Leopold learnt that King William's death was approaching, he\nwrote several long letters of excellent advice to his niece. \"In every\nletter I shall write to you,\" he said, \"I mean to repeat to you, as a\nFUNDAMENTAL RULE, TO BE FIRM, AND COURAGEOUS, AND HONEST, AS YOU HAVE\nBEEN TILL NOW.\" For the rest, in the crisis that was approaching, she\nwas not to be alarmed, but to trust in her \"good natural sense and the\nTRUTH\" of her character; she was to do nothing in a hurry; to hurt\nno one's amour-propre, and to continue her confidence in the Whig\nadministration! Not content with letters, however, King Leopold\ndetermined that the Princess should not lack personal guidance, and sent\nover to her aid the trusted friend whom, twenty years before, he had\ntaken to his heart by the death-bed at Claremont. Thus, once again, as\nif in accordance with some preordained destiny, the figure of Stockmar\nis discernible--inevitably present at a momentous hour.\nOn June 18, the King was visibly sinking. The Archbishop of Canterbury\nwas by his side, with all the comforts of the church. Nor did the holy\nwords fall upon a rebellious spirit; for many years his Majesty had\nbeen a devout believer. \"When I was a young man,\" he once explained at\na public banquet, \"as well as I can remember, I believed in nothing but\npleasure and folly--nothing at all. But when I went to sea, got into\na gale, and saw the wonders of the mighty deep, then I believed; and I\nhave been a sincere Christian ever since.\" It was the anniversary of the\nBattle of Waterloo, and the dying man remembered it. He should be glad\nto live, he said, over that day; he would never see another sunset. \"I\nhope your Majesty may live to see many,\" said Dr. Chambers. \"Oh! that's\nquite another thing, that's quite another thing,\" was the answer. One\nother sunset he did live to see; and he died in the early hours of the\nfollowing morning. It was on June 20, 1837.",

At six the Duchess woke up\nher daughter, and told her that the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord\nConyngham were there, and wished to see her. She got out of bed, put on\nher dressing-gown, and went, alone, into the room where the messengers\nwere standing. Lord Conyngham fell on his knees, and officially\nannounced the death of the King; the Archbishop added some personal\ndetails. Looking at the bending, murmuring dignitaries before her, she\nknew that she was Queen of England. \"Since it has pleased Providence,\"\nshe wrote that day in her journal, \"to place me in this station, I shall\ndo my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young, and\nperhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am sure,\nthat very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what\nis fit and right than I have.\" But there was scant time for resolutions\nand reflections. At once, affairs were thick upon her. Stockmar came to\nbreakfast, and gave some good advice. She wrote a letter to her uncle\nLeopold, and a hurried note to her sister Feodora. A letter came from\nthe Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, announcing his approaching arrival.\nHe came at nine, in full court dress, and kissed her hand. She saw him\nalone, and repeated to him the lesson which, no doubt, the faithful\nStockmar had taught her at breakfast. \"It has long been my intention to\nretain your Lordship and the rest of the present Ministry at the head\nof affairs;\" whereupon Lord Melbourne again kissed her hand and shortly\nafter left her. She then wrote a letter of condolence to Queen Adelaide.\nAt eleven, Lord Melbourne came again; and at half-past eleven she went\ndownstairs into the red saloon to hold her first Council. The great\nassembly of lords and notables, bishops, generals, and Ministers of\nState, saw the doors thrown open and a very short, very slim girl in\ndeep plain mourning come into the room alone and move forward to her\nseat with extraordinary dignity and grace; they saw a countenance, not\nbeautiful, but prepossessing--fair hair, blue prominent eyes, a small\ncurved nose, an open mouth revealing the upper teeth, a tiny chin,\na clear complexion, and, over all, the strangely mingled signs of\ninnocence, of gravity, of youth, and of composure; they heard a high\nunwavering voice reading aloud with perfect clarity; and then, the\nceremony was over, they saw the small figure rise and, with the same\nconsummate grace, the same amazing dignity, pass out from among them, as\nshe had come in, alone.\nCHAPTER",

            "text": "I\nThe new queen was almost entirely unknown to her subjects. In her public\nappearances her mother had invariably dominated the scene. Her private\nlife had been that of a novice in a convent: hardly a human being from\nthe outside world had ever spoken to her; and no human being at all,\nexcept her mother and the Baroness Lehzen, had ever been alone with\nher in a room. Thus it was not only the public at large that was in\nignorance of everything concerning her; the inner circles of statesmen\nand officials and high-born ladies were equally in the dark. When she\nsuddenly emerged from this deep obscurity, the impression that she\ncreated was immediate and profound. Her bearing at her first Council\nfilled the whole gathering with astonishment and admiration; the Duke of\nWellington, Sir Robert Peel, even the savage Croker, even the cold and\ncaustic Greville--all were completely carried away. Everything that was\nreported of her subsequent proceedings seemed to be of no less happy\naugury. Her perceptions were quick, her decisions were sensible, her\nlanguage was discreet; she performed her royal duties with extraordinary\nfacility. Among the outside public there was a great wave of enthusiasm.\nSentiment and romance were coming into fashion; and the spectacle of\nthe little girl-queen, innocent, modest, with fair hair and pink cheeks,\ndriving through her capital, filled the hearts of the beholders with\nraptures of affectionate loyalty. What, above all, struck everybody\nwith overwhelming force was the contrast between Queen Victoria and\nher uncles. The nasty old men, debauched and selfish, pig-headed and\nridiculous, with their perpetual burden of debts, confusions, and\ndisreputabilities--they had vanished like the snows of winter, and here\nat last, crowned and radiant, was the spring. Lord John Russell, in an\nelaborate oration, gave voice to the general sentiment. He hoped that\nVictoria might prove an Elizabeth without her tyranny, an Anne without\nher weakness. He asked England to pray that the illustrious Princess who\nhad just ascended the throne with the purest intentions and the justest\ndesires might see slavery abolished, crime diminished, and education\nimproved. He trusted that her people would henceforward derive their\nstrength, their conduct, and their loyalty from enlightened religious\nand moral principles, and that, so fortified, the reign of Victoria\nmight prove celebrated to posterity and to all the nations of the earth.",

The purest intentions and the justest\ndesires? No doubt; but was that all? To those who watched closely, for\ninstance, there might be something ominous in the curious contour\nof that little mouth. When, after her first Council, she crossed the\nante-room and found her mother waiting for her, she said, \"And now,\nMamma, am I really and truly Queen?\" \"You see, my dear, that it is so.\"\n\"Then, dear Mamma, I hope you will grant me the first request I make\nto you, as Queen. Let me be by myself for an hour.\" For an hour she\nremained in solitude. Then she reappeared, and gave a significant order:\nher bed was to be moved out of her mother's room. It was the doom of the\nDuchess of Kent. The long years of waiting were over at last; the moment\nof a lifetime had come; her daughter was Queen of England; and that very\nmoment brought her own annihilation. She found herself, absolutely and\nirretrievably, shut off from every vestige of influence, of confidence,\nof power. She was surrounded, indeed, by all the outward signs of\nrespect and consideration; but that only made the inward truth of her\nposition the more intolerable. Through the mingled formalities of Court\netiquette and filial duty, she could never penetrate to Victoria. She\nwas unable to conceal her disappointment and her rage. \"Il n'y a plus\nd'avenir pour moi,\" she exclaimed to Madame de Lieven; \"je ne suis plus\nrien.\" For eighteen years, she said, this child had been the sole object\nof her existence, of her thoughts, her hopes, and now--no! she would\nnot be comforted, she had lost everything, she was to the last degree\nunhappy. Sailing, so gallantly and so pertinaciously, through the\nbuffeting storms of life, the stately vessel, with sails still swelling\nand pennons flying, had put into harbour at last; to find there\nnothing--a land of bleak desolation.",

During the twenty years which had elapsed since the death of the\nPrincess Charlotte, his experiences had been varied and remarkable. The\nunknown counsellor of a disappointed princeling had gradually risen to a\nposition of European importance. His devotion to his master had been not\nonly whole--hearted but cautious and wise. It was Stockmar's advice\nthat had kept Prince Leopold in England during the critical years which\nfollowed his wife's death, and had thus secured to him the essential\nrequisite of a point d'appui in the country of his adoption. It was\nStockmar's discretion which had smoothed over the embarrassments\nsurrounding the Prince's acceptance and rejection of the Greek crown.\nIt was Stockmar who had induced the Prince to become the constitutional\nSovereign of Belgium. Above all, it was Stockmar's tact, honesty, and\ndiplomatic skill which, through a long series of arduous and complicated\nnegotiations, had led to the guarantee of Belgian neutrality by the\nGreat Powers. His labours had been rewarded by a German barony and by\nthe complete confidence of King Leopold. Nor was it only in Brussels\nthat he was treated with respect and listened to with attention.\nThe statesmen who governed England--Lord Grey, Sir Robert Peel, Lord\nPalmerston, Lord Melbourne--had learnt to put a high value upon his\nprobity and his intelligence. \"He is one of the cleverest fellows I\never saw,\" said Lord Melbourne, \"the most discreet man, the most\nwell-judging, and most cool man.\" And Lord Palmerston cited Baron\nStockmar as the only absolutely disinterested man he had come across in\nlife, At last he was able to retire to Coburg, and to enjoy for a few\nyears the society of the wife and children whom his labours in the\nservice of his master had hitherto only allowed him to visit at long\nintervals for a month or two at a time. But in 1836 he had been again\nentrusted with an important negotiation, which he had brought to\na successful conclusion in the marriage of Prince Ferdinand of\nSaxe-Coburg, a nephew of King Leopold's, with Queen Maria II of\nPortugal. The House of Coburg was beginning to spread over Europe; and\nthe establishment of the Baron at Buckingham Palace in 1837 was to be\nthe prelude of another and a more momentous advance.\nKing Leopold and his counsellor provide in their careers an example\nof the curious diversity of human ambitions. The desires of man are\nwonderfully various; but no less various are the means by which those\ndesires may reach satisfaction: and so the work of the world gets done.\nThe correct mind of Leopold craved for the whole apparatus of royalty.\nMere power would have held no attractions for him; he must be an actual\nking--the crowned head of a people. It was not enough to do; it was\nessential also to be recognised; anything else would not be fitting.\nThe greatness that he dreamt of was surrounded by every appropriate\ncircumstance. To be a Majesty, to be a cousin of Sovereigns, to marry a\nBourbon for diplomatic ends, to correspond with the Queen of England,\nto be very stiff and very punctual, to found a dynasty, to bore\nambassadresses into fits, to live, on the highest pinnacle, an exemplary\nlife devoted to the public service--such were his objects, and such,\nin fact, were his achievements. The \"Marquis Peu-a-peu,\" as George IV\ncalled him, had what he wanted. But this would never have been the case\nif it had not happened that the ambition of Stockmar took a form exactly\ncomplementary to his own. The sovereignty that the Baron sought for\nwas by no means obvious. The satisfaction of his essential being lay\nin obscurity, in invisibility--in passing, unobserved, through a hidden\nentrance, into the very central chamber of power, and in sitting there,\nquietly, pulling the subtle strings that set the wheels of the\nwhole world in motion. A very few people, in very high places, and\nexceptionally well-informed, knew that Baron Stockmar was a most\nimportant person: that was enough. The fortunes of the master and the\nservant, intimately interacting, rose together. The Baron's secret skill\nhad given Leopold his unexceptionable kingdom; and Leopold, in his turn,\nas time went on, was able to furnish the Baron with more and more keys\nto more and more back doors.\nStockmar took up his abode in the Palace partly as the emissary of King",

            "text": "William Lamb, Viscount Melbourne, was fifty-eight years of age, and\nhad been for the last three years Prime Minister of England. In every\noutward respect he was one of the most fortunate of mankind. He had\nbeen born into the midst of riches, brilliance, and power. His mother,\nfascinating and intelligent, had been a great Whig hostess, and he had\nbeen bred up as a member of that radiant society which, during the\nlast quarter of the eighteenth century, concentrated within itself\nthe ultimate perfections of a hundred years of triumphant aristocracy.\nNature had given him beauty and brains; the unexpected death of an\nelder brother brought him wealth, a peerage, and the possibility of\nhigh advancement. Within that charmed circle, whatever one's personal\ndisabilities, it was difficult to fail; and to him, with all his\nadvantages, success was well-nigh unavoidable. With little effort, he\nattained political eminence. On the triumph of the Whigs he became one\nof the leading members of the Government; and when Lord Grey retired\nfrom the premiership he quietly stepped into the vacant place. Nor was\nit only in the visible signs of fortune that Fate had been kind to him.\nBound to succeed, and to succeed easily, he was gifted with so fine\na nature that his success became him. His mind, at once supple and\ncopious, his temperament, at once calm and sensitive, enabled him not\nmerely to work, but to live with perfect facility and with the grace of\nstrength. In society he was a notable talker, a captivating companion,\na charming man. If one looked deeper, one saw at once that he was not\nordinary, that the piquancies of his conversation and his manner--his\nfree-and-easy vaguenesses, his abrupt questions, his lollings and\nloungings, his innumerable oaths--were something more than an amusing\nornament, were the outward manifestation of an individuality that was\nfundamental.\nThe precise nature of this individuality was very difficult to gauge: it\nwas dubious, complex, perhaps self--contradictory. Certainly there was\nan ironical discordance between the inner history of the man and his\napparent fortunes. He owed all he had to his birth, and his birth was\nshameful; it was known well enough that his mother had passionately\nloved Lord Egremont, and that Lord Melbourne was not his father. His\nmarriage, which had seemed to be the crown of his youthful ardours,\nwas a long, miserable, desperate failure: the incredible Lady Caroline,\n\"With pleasures too refined to please, With too much spirit to be\ne'er at ease, With too much quickness to be ever taught, With too much\nthinking to have common thought,\" was very nearly the destruction of\nhis life. When at last he emerged from the anguish and confusion of her\nfolly, her extravagance, her rage, her despair, and her devotion, he was\nleft alone with endless memories of intermingled farce and tragedy, and\nan only son, who was an imbecile. But there was something else that he\nowed to Lady Caroline. While she whirled with Byron in a hectic frenzy\nof love and fashion, he had stayed at home in an indulgence bordering\non cynicism, and occupied his solitude with reading. It was thus that he\nhad acquired those habits of study, that love of learning, and that wide\nand accurate knowledge of ancient and modern literature, which formed so\nunexpected a part of his mental equipment. His passion for reading never\ndeserted him; even when he was Prime Minister he found time to\nmaster every new important book. With an incongruousness that was\ncharacteristic, his favourite study was theology. An accomplished\nclassical scholar, he was deeply read in the Fathers of the Church;\nheavy volumes of commentary and exegesis he examined with scrupulous\ndiligence; and at any odd moment he might be found turning over the\npages of the Bible. To the ladies whom he most liked, he would lend some\nlearned work on the Revelation, crammed with marginal notes in his own\nhand, or Dr. Lardner's \"Observations upon the Jewish Errors with respect\nto the Conversion of Mary Magdalene.\" The more pious among them had high\nhopes that these studies would lead him into the right way; but of this\nthere were no symptoms in his after-dinner conversations.\nThe paradox of his political career was no less curious. By temperament\nan aristocrat, by conviction a conservative, he came to power as the\nleader of the popular party, the party of change. He had profoundly\ndisliked the Reform Bill, which he had only accepted at last as\na necessary evil; and the Reform Bill lay at the root of the very\nexistence, of the very meaning, of his government. He was far too\nsceptical to believe in progress of any kind. Things were best as they\nwere or rather, they were least bad. \"You'd better try to do no good,\"\nwas one of his dictums, \"and then you'll get into no scrapes.\" Education\nat best was futile; education of the poor was positively dangerous. The\nfactory children? \"Oh, if you'd only have the goodness to leave them\nalone!\" Free Trade was a delusion; the ballot was nonsense; and there\nwas no such thing as a democracy.\nNevertheless, he was not a reactionary; he was simply an opportunist.\nThe whole duty of government, he said, was \"to prevent crime and to\npreserve contracts.\" All one could really hope to do was to carry on. He\nhimself carried on in a remarkable manner--with perpetual compromises,\nwith fluctuations and contradictions, with every kind of weakness, and\nyet with shrewdness, with gentleness, even with conscientiousness, and\na light and airy mastery of men and of events. He conducted the\ntransactions of business with extraordinary nonchalance. Important\npersons, ushered up for some grave interview, found him in a\ntowselled bed, littered with books and papers, or vaguely shaving in a\ndressing-room; but, when they went downstairs again, they would realise\nthat somehow or other they had been pumped. When he had to receive a\ndeputation, he could hardly ever do so with becoming gravity. The worthy\ndelegates of the tallow-chandlers, or the Society for the Abolition of\nCapital Punishment, were distressed and mortified when, in the midst of\ntheir speeches, the Prime Minister became absorbed in blowing a feather,\nor suddenly cracked an unseemly joke. How could they have guessed that\nhe had spent the night before diligently getting up the details of their\ncase? He hated patronage and the making of appointments--a feeling rare\nin Ministers. \"As for the Bishops,\" he burst out, \"I positively believe\nthey die to vex me.\" But when at last the appointment was made, it\nwas made with keen discrimination. His colleagues observed another\nsymptom--was it of his irresponsibility or his wisdom? He went to sleep\nin the Cabinet.\nProbably, if he had been born a little earlier, he would have been a\nsimpler and a happier man. As it was, he was a child of the eighteenth\ncentury whose lot was cast in a new, difficult, unsympathetic age.\nHe was an autumn rose. With all his gracious amenity, his humour, his\nhappy-go-lucky ways, a deep disquietude possessed him. A sentimental\ncynic, a sceptical believer, he was restless and melancholy at heart.\nAbove all, he could never harden himself; those sensitive petals\nshivered in every wind. Whatever else he might be, one thing was\ncertain: Lord Melbourne was always human, supremely human--too human,\nperhaps.\nAnd now, with old age upon him, his life took a sudden, new,\nextraordinary turn. He became, in the twinkling of an eye, the intimate\nadviser and the daily companion of a young girl who had stepped all at\nonce from a nursery to a throne. His relations with women had been, like\neverything else about him, ambiguous. Nobody had ever been able quite\nto gauge the shifting, emotional complexities of his married life; Lady\nCaroline vanished; but his peculiar susceptibilities remained. Female\nsociety of some kind or other was necessary to him, and he did not\nstint himself; a great part of every day was invariably spent in it. The\nfeminine element in him made it easy, made it natural and inevitable for\nhim to be the friend of a great many women; but the masculine element\nin him was strong as well. In such circumstances it is also easy, it is\neven natural, perhaps it is even inevitable, to be something more than\na friend. There were rumours and combustions. Lord Melbourne was twice a\nco-respondent in a divorce action; but on each occasion he won his suit.\nThe lovely Lady Brandon, the unhappy and brilliant Mrs. Norton... the\nlaw exonerated them both. Beyond that hung an impenetrable veil. But\nat any rate it was clear that, with such a record, the Prime Minister's\nposition in Buckingham Palace must be a highly delicate one. However,\nhe was used to delicacies, and he met the situation with consummate\nsuccess. His behaviour was from the first moment impeccable. His manner\ntowards the young Queen mingled, with perfect facility, the watchfulness\nand the respect of a statesman and a courtier with the tender solicitude\nof a parent. He was at once reverential and affectionate, at once the\nservant and the guide. At the same time the habits of his life underwent\na surprising change. His comfortable, unpunctual days became subject to\nthe unaltering routine of a palace; no longer did he sprawl on sofas;\nnot a single \"damn\" escaped his lips. The man of the world who had been\nthe friend of Byron and the regent, the talker whose paradoxes had held\nHolland House enthralled, the cynic whose ribaldries had enlivened so\nmany deep potations, the lover whose soft words had captivated such\nbeauty and such passion and such wit, might now be seen, evening after\nevening, talking with infinite politeness to a schoolgirl, bolt upright,\namid the silence and the rigidity of Court etiquette.\nIV\nOn her side, Victoria was instantaneously fascinated by Lord Melbourne.\nThe good report of Stockmar had no doubt prepared the way; Lehzen was\nwisely propitiated; and the first highly favourable impression was never\nafterwards belied. She found him perfect; and perfect in her sight he\nremained. Her absolute and unconcealed adoration was very natural; what\ninnocent young creature could have resisted, in any circumstances, the\ncharm and the devotion of such a man? But, in her situation, there was\na special influence which gave a peculiar glow to all she felt. After\nyears of emptiness and dullness and suppression, she had come suddenly,\nin the heyday of youth, into freedom and power. She was mistress\nof herself, of great domains and palaces; she was Queen of England.\nResponsibilities and difficulties she might have, no doubt, and in heavy\nmeasure; but one feeling dominated and absorbed all others--the feeling\nof joy. Everything pleased her. She was in high spirits from morning\ntill night. Mr. Creevey, grown old now, and very near his end, catching\na glimpse of her at Brighton, was much amused, in his sharp fashion, by\nthe ingenuous gaiety of \"little Vic.\" \"A more homely little being you\nnever beheld, when she is at her ease, and she is evidently dying to be\nalways more so. She laughs in real earnest, opening her mouth as wide as\nit can go, showing not very pretty gums... She eats quite as heartily\nas she laughs, I think I may say she gobbles... She blushes and laughs\nevery instant in so natural a way as to disarm anybody.\" But it was not\nmerely when she was laughing or gobbling that she enjoyed herself; the\nperformance of her official duties gave her intense satisfaction. \"I\nreally have immensely to do,\" she wrote in her Journal a few days after\nher accession; \"I receive so many communications from my Ministers, but\nI like it very much.\" And again, a week later, \"I repeat what I said\nbefore that I have so many communications from the Ministers, and from\nme to them, and I get so many papers to sign every day, that I have\nalways a very great deal to do. I delight in this work.\" Through the\ngirl's immaturity the vigorous predestined tastes of the woman were\npushing themselves into existence with eager velocity, with delicious\nforce.\nOne detail of her happy situation deserves particular mention. Apart\nfrom the splendour of her social position and the momentousness of her\npolitical one, she was a person of great wealth. As soon as Parliament\nmet, an annuity of L385,000 was settled upon her. When the expenses of\nher household had been discharged, she was left with L68,000 a year of\nher own. She enjoyed besides the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster,\nwhich amounted annually to over L27,000. The first use to which she put\nher money was characteristic: she paid off her father's debts. In\nmoney matters, no less than in other matters, she was determined to be\ncorrect. She had the instincts of a man of business; and she never could\nhave borne to be in a position that was financially unsound.\nWith youth and happiness gilding every hour, the days passed merrily\nenough. And each day hinged upon Lord Melbourne. Her diary shows us,\nwith undiminished clarity, the life of the young sovereign during\nthe early months of her reign--a life satisfactorily regular, full\nof delightful business, a life of simple pleasures, mostly\nphysical--riding, eating, dancing--a quick, easy, highly unsophisticated\nlife, sufficient unto itself. The light of the morning is upon it; and,\nin the rosy radiance, the figure of \"Lord M.\" emerges, glorified and\nsupreme. If she is the heroine of the story, he is the hero; but indeed\nthey are more than hero and heroine, for there are no other characters\nat all. Lehzen, the Baron, Uncle Leopold, are unsubstantial shadows--the\nincidental supers of the piece. Her paradise was peopled by two persons,\nand surely that was enough. One sees them together still, a curious\ncouple, strangely united in those artless pages, under the magical\nillumination of that dawn of eighty years ago: the polished high fine\ngentleman with the whitening hair and whiskers and the thick dark\neyebrows and the mobile lips and the big expressive eyes; and beside him\nthe tiny Queen--fair, slim, elegant, active, in her plain girl's dress\nand little tippet, looking up at him earnestly, adoringly, with eyes\nblue and projecting, and half-open mouth. So they appear upon every page\nof the Journal; upon every page Lord M. is present, Lord M. is speaking,\nLord M. is being amusing, instructive, delightful, and affectionate at\nonce, while Victoria drinks in the honied words, laughs till she shows\nher gums, tries hard to remember, and runs off, as soon as she is left\nalone, to put it all down. Their long conversations touched upon a\nmultitude of topics. Lord M. would criticise books, throw out a remark\nor two on the British Constitution, make some passing reflections\non human life, and tell story after story of the great people of the\neighteenth century. Then there would be business a despatch perhaps\nfrom Lord Durham in Canada, which Lord M. would read. But first he\nmust explain a little. \"He said that I must know that Canada originally\nbelonged to the French, and was only ceded to the English in 1760, when\nit was taken in an expedition under Wolfe: 'a very daring enterprise,'\nhe said. Canada was then entirely French, and the British only came\nafterwards... Lord M. explained this very clearly (and much better\nthan I have done) and said a good deal more about it. He then read me\nDurham's despatch, which is a very long one and took him more than 1/2\nan hour to read. Lord M. read it beautifully with that fine soft voice\nof his, and with so much expression, so that it is needless to say I\nwas much interested by it.\" And then the talk would take a more personal\nturn. Lord M. would describe his boyhood, and she would learn that \"he\nwore his hair long, as all boys then did, till he was 17; (how handsome\nhe must have looked!).\" Or she would find out about his queer tastes and\nhabits--how he never carried a watch, which seemed quite extraordinary.\n\"'I always ask the servant what o'clock it is, and then he tells me what\nhe likes,' said Lord M.\" Or, as the rooks wheeled about round the trees,\n\"in a manner which indicated rain,\" he would say that he could sit\nlooking at them for an hour, and \"was quite surprised at my disliking\nthem. M. said, 'The rooks are my delight.'\"",

            "text": "The day's routine, whether in London or at Windsor, was almost\ninvariable. The morning was devoted to business and Lord M. In the\nafternoon the whole Court went out riding. The Queen, in her velvet\nriding--habit and a top-hat with a veil draped about the brim, headed\nthe cavalcade; and Lord M. rode beside her. The lively troupe went fast\nand far, to the extreme exhilaration of Her Majesty. Back in the Palace\nagain, there was still time for a little more fun before dinner--a game\nof battledore and shuttlecock perhaps, or a romp along the galleries\nwith some children. Dinner came, and the ceremonial decidedly tightened.\nThe gentleman of highest rank sat on the right hand of the Queen; on her\nleft--it soon became an established rule--sat Lord Melbourne. After the\nladies had left the dining-room, the gentlemen were not permitted to\nremain behind for very long; indeed, the short time allowed them for\ntheir wine-drinking formed the subject--so it was rumoured--of one of\nthe very few disputes between the Queen and her Prime Minister;(*) but\nher determination carried the day, and from that moment after-dinner\ndrunkenness began to go out of fashion. When the company was reassembled\nin the drawing-room the etiquette was stiff. For a few moments the Queen\nspoke in turn to each one of her guests; and during these short uneasy\ncolloquies the aridity of royalty was apt to become painfully evident.\nOne night Mr. Greville, the Clerk of the Privy Council, was present; his\nturn soon came; the middle-aged, hard-faced viveur was addressed by his\nyoung hostess. \"Have you been riding to-day, Mr. Greville?\" asked the\nQueen. \"No, Madam, I have not,\" replied Mr. Greville. \"It was a fine\nday,\" continued the Queen. \"Yes, Madam, a very fine day,\" said Mr.\nGreville. \"It was rather cold, though,\" said the Queen. \"It was rather\ncold, Madam,\" said Mr. Greville. \"Your sister, Lady Frances Egerton,\nrides, I think, doesn't she?\" said the Queen. \"She does ride sometimes,\nMadam,\" said Mr. Greville. There was a pause, after which Mr. Greville\nventured to take the lead, though he did not venture to change the\nsubject. \"Has your Majesty been riding today?\" asked Mr. Greville. \"Oh\nyes, a very long ride,\" answered the Queen with animation. \"Has your\nMajesty got a nice horse?\" said Mr. Greville. \"Oh, a very nice horse,\"\nsaid the Queen. It was over. Her Majesty gave a smile and an inclination\nof the head, Mr. Greville a profound bow, and the next conversation\nbegan with the next gentleman. When all the guests had been disposed\nof, the Duchess of Kent sat down to her whist, while everybody else was\nranged about the round table. Lord Melbourne sat beside the Queen, and\ntalked pertinaciously--very often a propos to the contents of one of the\nlarge albums of engravings with which the round table was covered--until\nit was half-past eleven and time to go to bed.\n(*) The Duke of Bedford told Greville he was \"sure there was\na battle between her and Melbourne... He is sure there was\none about the men's sitting after dinner, for he heard her\nsay to him rather angrily, 'it is a horrid custom-' but when\nthe ladies left the room (he dined there) directions were\ngiven that the men should remain five minutes longer.\"\nGreville Memoirs, February 26, 1840 (unpublished).\nOccasionally, there were little diversions: the evening might be spent\nat the opera or at the play. Next morning the royal critic was careful\nto note down her impressions. \"It was Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet,\nand we came in at the beginning of it. Mr. Charles Kean (son of\nold Kean) acted the part of Hamlet, and I must say beautifully.\nHis conception of this very difficult, and I may almost say\nincomprehensible, character is admirable; his delivery of all the fine\nlong speeches quite beautiful; he is excessively graceful and all\nhis actions and attitudes are good, though not at all good-looking in\nface... I came away just as Hamlet was over.\" Later on, she went to see\nMacready in King Lear. The story was new to her; she knew nothing about\nit, and at first she took very little interest in what was passing on\nthe stage; she preferred to chatter and laugh with the Lord Chamberlain.\nBut, as the play went on, her mood changed; her attention was fixed, and\nthen she laughed no more. Yet she was puzzled; it seemed a strange, a\nhorrible business. What did Lord M. think? Lord M. thought it was a\nvery fine play, but to be sure, \"a rough, coarse play, written for\nthose times, with exaggerated characters.\" \"I'm glad you've seen it,\" he\nadded. But, undoubtedly, the evenings which she enjoyed most were those\non which there was dancing. She was always ready enough to seize\nany excuse--the arrival of cousins--a birthday--a gathering of young\npeople--to give the command for that. Then, when the band played, and\nthe figures of the dancers swayed to the music, and she felt her own\nfigure swaying too, with youthful spirits so close on every side--then\nher happiness reached its height, her eyes sparkled, she must go on and\non into the small hours of the morning. For a moment Lord M. himself was\nforgotten.\nV\nThe months flew past. The summer was over: \"the pleasantest summer I\nEVER passed in MY LIFE, and I shall never forget this first summer of\nmy reign.\" With surprising rapidity, another summer was upon her. The\ncoronation came and went--a curious dream. The antique, intricate,\nendless ceremonial worked itself out as best it could, like some machine\nof gigantic complexity which was a little out of order. The small\ncentral figure went through her gyrations. She sat; she walked; she\nprayed; she carried about an orb that was almost too heavy to hold; the\nArchbishop of Canterbury came and crushed a ring upon the wrong finger,\nso that she was ready to cry out with the pain; old Lord Rolle tripped\nup in his mantle and fell down the steps as he was doing homage; she\nwas taken into a side chapel, where the altar was covered with a\ntable-cloth, sandwiches, and bottles of wine; she perceived Lehzen in an\nupper box and exchanged a smile with her as she sat, robed and crowned,\non the Confessor's throne. \"I shall ever remember this day as the\nPROUDEST of my life,\" she noted. But the pride was soon merged once more\nin youth and simplicity. When she returned to Buckingham Palace at\nlast she was not tired; she ran up to her private rooms, doffed her\nsplendours, and gave her dog Dash its evening bath.\nLife flowed on again with its accustomed smoothness--though, of course,",

            "text": "the smoothness was occasionally disturbed. For one thing, there was the\ndistressing behaviour of Uncle Leopold. The King of the Belgians had\nnot been able to resist attempting to make use of his family position\nto further his diplomatic ends. But, indeed, why should there be any\nquestion of resisting? Was not such a course of conduct, far from being\na temptation, simply \"selon les regles?\" What were royal marriages\nfor, if they did not enable sovereigns, in spite of the hindrances of\nconstitutions, to control foreign politics? For the highest purposes,\nof course; that was understood. The Queen of England was his niece--more\nthan that--almost his daughter; his confidential agent was living, in\na position of intimate favour, at her court. Surely, in such\ncircumstances, it would be preposterous, it would be positively\nincorrect, to lose the opportunity of bending to his wishes by means\nof personal influence, behind the backs of the English Ministers, the\nforeign policy of England.\nHe set about the task with becoming precautions. He continued in his\nletters his admirable advice. Within a few days of her accession, he\nrecommended the young Queen to lay emphasis, on every possible occasion,\nupon her English birth; to praise the English nation; \"the Established\nChurch I also recommend strongly; you cannot, without PLEDGING yourself\nto anything PARTICULAR, SAY TOO MUCH ON THE SUBJECT.\" And then \"before\nyou decide on anything important I should be glad if you would consult\nme; this would also have the advantage of giving you time;\" nothing was\nmore injurious than to be hurried into wrong decisions unawares. His\nniece replied at once with all the accustomed warmth of her affection;\nbut she wrote hurriedly--and, perhaps, a trifle vaguely too. \"YOUR\nadvice is always of the GREATEST IMPORTANCE to me,\" she said.\nHad he, possibly, gone too far? He could not be certain; perhaps\nVictoria HAD been hurried. In any case, he would be careful; he would\ndraw back--\"pour mieux sauter\" he added to himself with a smile. In his\nnext letters he made no reference to his suggestion of consultations\nwith himself; he merely pointed out the wisdom, in general, of refusing\nto decide upon important questions off-hand. So far, his advice was\ntaken; and it was noticed that the Queen, when applications were made to\nher, rarely gave an immediate answer. Even with Lord Melbourne, it was\nthe same; when he asked for her opinion upon any subject, she would\nreply that she would think it over, and tell him her conclusions next\nday.\nKing Leopold's counsels continued. The Princess de Lieven, he said,\nwas a dangerous woman; there was reason to think that she would make\nattempts to pry into what did not concern her, let Victoria beware. \"A\nrule which I cannot sufficiently recommend is NEVER TO PERMIT people\nto speak on subjects concerning yourself or your affairs, without you\nhaving yourself desired them to do so.\" Should such a thing occur,\n\"change the conversation, and make the individual feel that he has made\na mistake.\" This piece of advice was also taken; for it fell out as the\nKing had predicted. Madame de Lieven sought an audience, and appeared\nto be verging towards confidential topics; whereupon the Queen, becoming\nslightly embarrassed, talked of nothing but commonplaces. The individual\nfelt that she had made a mistake.\nThe King's next warning was remarkable. Letters, he pointed out, are\nalmost invariably read in the post. This was inconvenient, no doubt; but\nthe fact, once properly grasped, was not without its advantages. \"I will\ngive you an example: we are still plagued by Prussia concerning those\nfortresses; now to tell the Prussian Government many things, which we\nSHOULD NOT LIKE to tell them officially, the Minister is going to write\na despatch to our man at Berlin, sending it BY POST; the Prussians ARE\nSURE to read it, and to learn in this way what we wish them to hear.\nAnalogous circumstances might very probably occur in England. I tell you\nthe TRICK,\" wrote His Majesty, \"that you should be able to guard against\nit.\" Such were the subtleties of constitutional sovereignty.\nIt seemed that the time had come for another step. The King's next\nletter was full of foreign politics--the situation in Spain and\nPortugal, the character of Louis Philippe; and he received a favourable\nanswer. Victoria, it is true, began by saying that she had shown the\nPOLITICAL PART of his letter to Lord Melbourne; but she proceeded to a\ndiscussion of foreign affairs. It appeared that she was not unwilling\nto exchange observations on such matters with her uncle. So far so good.\nBut King Leopold was still cautious; though a crisis was impending\nin his diplomacy, he still hung back; at last, however, he could keep\nsilence no longer. It was of the utmost importance to him that, in his\nmanoeuvrings with France and Holland, he should have, or at any rate\nappear to have, English support. But the English Government appeared to\nadopt a neutral attitude; it was too bad; not to be for him was to\nbe against him, could they not see that? Yet, perhaps, they were only\nwavering, and a little pressure upon them from Victoria might still\nsave all. He determined to put the case before her, delicately yet\nforcibly--just as he saw it himself. \"All I want from your kind\nMajesty,\" he wrote, \"is, that you will OCCASIONALLY express to your\nMinisters, and particularly to good Lord Melbourne, that, as far as it\nis COMPATIBLE with the interests of your own dominions, you do NOT wish\nthat your Government should take the lead in such measures as might in a\nshort time bring on the DESTRUCTION of this country, as well as that of\nyour uncle and his family.\" The result of this appeal was unexpected;\nthere was dead silence for more than a week. When Victoria at last\nwrote, she was prodigal of her affection. \"It would, indeed, my dearest\nUncle, be VERY WRONG of you, if you thought my feelings of warm and\ndevoted attachment to you, and of great affection for you, could be\nchanged--nothing can ever change them\"--but her references to foreign\npolitics, though they were lengthy and elaborate, were non-committal in\nthe extreme; they were almost cast in an official and diplomatic form.\nHer Ministers, she said, entirely shared her views upon the subject; she\nunderstood and sympathised with the difficulties of her beloved uncle's\nposition; and he might rest assured \"that both Lord Melbourne and Lord\nPalmerston are most anxious at all times for the prosperity and welfare\nof Belgium.\" That was all. The King in his reply declared himself\ndelighted, and re-echoed the affectionate protestations of his niece.\n\"My dearest and most beloved Victoria,\" he said, \"you have written me\na VERY DEAR and long letter, which has given me GREAT PLEASURE AND\nSATISFACTION.\" He would not admit that he had had a rebuff.",

            "text": "A few months later the crisis came. King Leopold determined to make a\nbold push, and to carry Victoria with him, this time, by a display of\nroyal vigour and avuncular authority. In an abrupt, an almost peremptory\nletter, he laid his case, once more, before his niece. \"You know from\nexperience,\" he wrote, \"that I NEVER ASK ANYTHING OF YOU... But, as I\nsaid before, if we are not careful we may see serious consequences which\nmay affect more or less everybody, and THIS ought to be the object\nof our most anxious attention. I remain, my dear Victoria, your\naffectionate uncle, Leopold R.\" The Queen immediately despatched this\nletter to Lord Melbourne, who replied with a carefully thought-out form\nof words, signifying nothing whatever, which, he suggested, she should\nsend to her uncle. She did so, copying out the elaborate formula, with a\nliberal scattering of \"dear Uncles\" interspersed; and she concluded\nher letter with a message of \"affectionate love to Aunt Louise and the\nchildren.\" Then at last King Leopold was obliged to recognise the facts.\nHis next letter contained no reference at all to politics. \"I am glad,\"\nhe wrote, \"to find that you like Brighton better than last year. I think\nBrighton very agreeable at this time of the year, till the east winds\nset in. The pavilion, besides, is comfortable; that cannot be denied.\nBefore my marriage, it was there that I met the Regent. Charlotte\nafterwards came with old Queen Charlotte. How distant all this already,\nbut still how present to one's memory.\" Like poor Madame de Lieven, His\nMajesty felt that he had made a mistake.\nNevertheless, he could not quite give up all hope. Another opportunity\noffered, and he made another effort--but there was not very much\nconviction in it, and it was immediately crushed. \"My dear Uncle,\" the\nQueen wrote, \"I have to thank you for your last letter which I received\non Sunday. Though you seem not to dislike my political sparks, I think\nit is better not to increase them, as they might finally take fire,\nparticularly as I see with regret that upon this one subject we cannot\nagree. I shall, therefore, limit myself to my expressions of very\nsincere wishes for the welfare and prosperity of Belgium.\" After that,\nit was clear that there was no more to be said. Henceforward there is\naudible in the King's letters a curiously elegiac note. \"My dearest\nVictoria, your DELIGHTFUL little letter has just arrived and went\nlike AN ARROW TO MY HEART. Yes, my beloved Victoria! I DO LOVE YOU\nTENDERLY... I love you FOR YOURSELF, and I love in you the dear child\nwhose welfare I tenderly watched.\" He had gone through much; yet, if\nlife had its disappointments, it had its satisfactions too. \"I have\nall the honours that can be given, and I am, politically speaking, very\nsolidly established.\" But there were other things besides politics,\nthere were romantic yearnings in his heart. \"The only longing I still\nhave is for the Orient, where I perhaps shall once end my life, rising\nin the west and setting in the east.\" As for his devotion to his\nniece, that could never end. \"I never press my services on you, nor my\ncouncils, though I may say with some truth that from the extraordinary\nfate which the higher powers had ordained for me, my experience, both\npolitical and of private life, is great. I am ALWAYS READY to be useful\nto you when and where and it may be, and I repeat it, ALL I WANT IN\nRETURN IS SOME LITTLE SINCERE AFFECTION FROM YOU.\"\nVI\nThe correspondence with King Leopold was significant of much that still\nlay partly hidden in the character of Victoria. Her attitude towards\nher uncle had never wavered for a moment. To all his advances she had\npresented an absolutely unyielding front. The foreign policy of England\nwas not his province; it was hers and her Ministers'; his insinuations,\nhis entreaties, his struggles--all were quite useless; and he must\nunderstand that this was so. The rigidity of her position was the more\nstriking owing to the respectfulness and the affection with which it was\naccompanied. From start to finish the unmoved Queen remained the devoted\nniece. Leopold himself must have envied such perfect correctitude; but\nwhat may be admirable in an elderly statesman is alarming in a maiden\nof nineteen. And privileged observers were not without their fears. The\nstrange mixture of ingenuous light-heartedness and fixed determination,\nof frankness and reticence, of childishness and pride, seemed to augur\na future that was perplexed and full of dangers. As time passed the less\npleasant qualities in this curious composition revealed themselves more\noften and more seriously. There were signs of an imperious, a peremptory\ntemper, an egotism that was strong and hard. It was noticed that the\npalace etiquette, far from relaxing, grew ever more and more inflexible.\nBy some, this was attributed to Lehzen's influence; but, if that was\nso, Lehzen had a willing pupil; for the slightest infringements of\nthe freezing rules of regularity and deference were invariably and\nimmediately visited by the sharp and haughty glances of the Queen. Yet\nHer Majesty's eyes, crushing as they could be, were less crushing than\nher mouth. The self-will depicted in those small projecting teeth and\nthat small receding chin was of a more dismaying kind than that which a\npowerful jaw betokens; it was a self--will imperturbable, impenetrable,\nunintelligent; a self-will dangerously akin to obstinacy. And the\nobstinacy of monarchs is not as that of other men.\nWithin two years of her accession, the storm-clouds which, from the\nfirst, had been dimly visible on the horizon, gathered and burst.\nVictoria's relations with her mother had not improved. The Duchess\nof Kent, still surrounded by all the galling appearances of filial\nconsideration, remained in Buckingham Palace a discarded figure,\npowerless and inconsolable. Sir John Conroy, banished from the presence\nof the Queen, still presided over the Duchess's household, and the\nhostilities of Kensington continued unabated in the new surroundings.\nLady Flora Hastings still cracked her malicious jokes; the animosity of\nthe Baroness was still unappeased. One day, Lady Flora found the joke\nwas turned against her. Early in 1839, travelling in the suite of the\nDuchess, she had returned from Scotland in the same carriage with Sir\nJohn. A change in her figure became the subject of an unseemly jest;\ntongues wagged; and the jest grew serious. It was whispered that Lady\nFlora was with child. The state of her health seemed to confirm the\nsuspicion; she consulted Sir James Clark, the royal physician, and,\nafter the consultation, Sir James let his tongue wag, too. On this, the\nscandal flared up sky-high. Everyone was talking; the Baroness was not\nsurprised; the Duchess rallied tumultuously to the support of her lady;\nthe Queen was informed. At last the extraordinary expedient of a medical\nexamination was resorted to, during which Sir James, according to Lady\nFlora, behaved with brutal rudeness, while a second doctor was\nextremely polite. Finally, both physicians signed a certificate entirely\nexculpating the lady. But this was by no means the end of the business.\nThe Hastings family, socially a very powerful one, threw itself into\nthe fray with all the fury of outraged pride and injured innocence; Lord\nHastings insisted upon an audience of the Queen, wrote to the papers,\nand demanded the dismissal of Sir James Clark. The Queen expressed her\nregret to Lady Flora, but Sir James Clark was not dismissed. The tide\nof opinion turned violently against the Queen and her advisers; high\nsociety was disgusted by all this washing of dirty linen in Buckingham\nPalace; the public at large was indignant at the ill-treatment of Lady\nFlora. By the end of March, the popularity, so radiant and so abundant,\nwith which the young Sovereign had begun her reign, had entirely\ndisappeared.\nThere can be no doubt that a great lack of discretion had been shown by\nthe Court. Ill-natured tittle-tattle, which should have been instantly\nnipped in the bud, had been allowed to assume disgraceful proportions;\nand the Throne itself had become involved in the personal malignities\nof the palace. A particularly awkward question had been raised by the\nposition of Sir James Clark. The Duke of Wellington, upon whom it was\ncustomary to fall back, in cases of great difficulty in high places, had\nbeen consulted upon this question, and he had given it as his opinion\nthat, as it would be impossible to remove Sir James without a public\nenquiry, Sir James must certainly stay where he was. Probably the Duke\nwas right; but the fact that the peccant doctor continued in the\nQueen's service made the Hastings family irreconcilable and produced an\nunpleasant impression of unrepentant error upon the public mind. As for\nVictoria, she was very young and quite inexperienced; and she can hardly\nbe blamed for having failed to control an extremely difficult situation.\nThat was clearly Lord Melbourne's task; he was a man of the world, and,\nwith vigilance and circumspection, he might have quietly put out the\nugly flames while they were still smouldering. He did not do so; he\nwas lazy and easy-going; the Baroness was persistent, and he let things\nslide. But doubtless his position was not an easy one; passions ran\nhigh in the palace; and Victoria was not only very young, she was very\nheadstrong, too. Did he possess the magic bridle which would curb\nthat fiery steed? He could not be certain. And then, suddenly, another\nviolent crisis revealed more unmistakably than ever the nature of the\nmind with which he had to deal.\nVII\nThe Queen had for long been haunted by a terror that the day might come\nwhen she would be obliged to part with her Minister. Ever since the\npassage of the Reform Bill, the power of the Whig Government had\nsteadily declined. The General Election of 1837 had left them with a\nvery small majority in the House of Commons; since then, they had been\nin constant difflculties--abroad, at home, in Ireland; the Radical group\nhad grown hostile; it became highly doubtful how much longer they could\nsurvive. The Queen watched the development of events in great anxiety.\nShe was a Whig by birth, by upbringing, by every association, public and\nprivate; and, even if those ties had never existed, the mere fact that\nLord M. was the head of the Whigs would have amply sufficed to determine\nher politics. The fall of the Whigs would mean a sad upset for Lord M.\nBut it would have a still more terrible consequence: Lord M. would have\nto leave her; and the daily, the hourly, presence of Lord M. had become\nan integral part of her life. Six months after her accession she had\nnoted in her diary \"I shall be very sorry to lose him even for one\nnight;\" and this feeling of personal dependence on her Minister steadily\nincreased. In these circumstances it was natural that she should have\nbecome a Whig partisan. Of the wider significance of political questions\nshe knew nothing; all she saw was that her friends were in office and\nabout her, and that it would be dreadful if they ceased to be so. \"I\ncannot say,\" she wrote when a critical division was impending, \"(though\nI feel confident of our success) how low, how sad I feel, when I think\nof the possibility of this excellent and truly kind man not remaining my\nMinister! Yet I trust fervently that He who has so wonderfully protected\nme through such manifold difficulties will not now desert me! I should\nhave liked to have expressed to Lord M. my anxiety, but the tears were\nnearer than words throughout the time I saw him, and I felt I should\nhave choked, had I attempted to say anything.\" Lord Melbourne\nrealised clearly enough how undesirable was such a state of mind in\na constitutional sovereign who might be called upon at any moment to\nreceive as her Ministers the leaders of the opposite party; he did what\nhe could to cool her ardour; but in vain.\nWith considerable lack of foresight, too, he had himself helped to bring\nabout this unfortunate condition of affairs. From the moment of her\naccession, he had surrounded the Queen with ladies of his own party; the\nMistress of the Robes and all the Ladies of the Bedchamber were Whigs.\nIn the ordinary course, the Queen never saw a Tory: eventually she took\npains never to see one in any circumstances. She disliked the whole\ntribe; and she did not conceal the fact. She particularly disliked Sir\nRobert Peel, who would almost certainly be the next Prime Minister.\nHis manners were detestable, and he wanted to turn out Lord M. His\nsupporters, without exception, were equally bad; and as for Sir James\nGraham, she could not bear the sight of him; he was exactly like Sir\nJohn Conroy.\nThe affair of Lady Flora intensified these party rumours still further.\nThe Hastings were Tories, and Lord Melbourne and the Court were attacked\nby the Tory press in unmeasured language. The Queen's sectarian\nzeal proportionately increased. But the dreaded hour was now fast\napproaching. Early in May the Ministers were visibly tottering; on a\nvital point of policy they could only secure a majority of five in the\nHouse of Commons; they determined to resign. When Victoria heard the\nnews she burst into tears. Was it possible, then, that all was over? Was\nshe, indeed, about to see Lord M. for the last time? Lord M. came; and\nit is a curious fact that, even in this crowning moment of misery and\nagitation, the precise girl noted, to the minute, the exact time of the\narrival and the departure of her beloved Minister. The conversation was\ntouching and prolonged; but it could only end in one way--the Queen must\nsend for the Duke of Wellington. When, next morning, the Duke came, he\nadvised her Majesty to send for Sir Robert Peel. She was in \"a state of\ndreadful grief,\" but she swallowed down her tears, and braced herself,\nwith royal resolution, for the odious, odious interview.\nPeel was by nature reserved, proud, and shy. His manners were not\nperfect, and he knew it; he was easily embarrassed, and, at such\nmoments, he grew even more stiff and formal than before, while his\nfeet mechanically performed upon the carpet a dancing-master's measure.\nAnxious as he now was to win the Queen's good graces, his very anxiety\nto do so made the attainment of his object the more difficult. He\nentirely failed to make any headway whatever with the haughty hostile\ngirl before him. She coldly noted that he appeared to be unhappy and\n\"put out,\" and, while he stood in painful fixity, with an occasional\nuneasy pointing of the toe, her heart sank within her at the sight of\nthat manner, \"Oh! how different, how dreadfully different, to the\nfrank, open, natural, and most kind warm manner of Lord Melbourne.\"\nNevertheless, the audience passed without disaster. Only at one point\nhad there been some slight hint of a disagreement. Peel had decided that\na change would be necessary in the composition of the royal Household:\nthe Queen must no longer be entirely surrounded by the wives and sisters\nof his opponents; some, at any rate, of the Ladies of the Bedchamber\nshould be friendly to his Government. When this matter was touched\nupon, the Queen had intimated that she wished her Household to remain\nunchanged; to which Sir Robert had replied that the question could be\nsettled later, and shortly afterwards withdrew to arrange the details of\nhis Cabinet. While he was present, Victoria had remained, as she herself\nsaid, \"very much collected, civil and high, and betrayed no agitation;\"\nbut as soon as she was alone she completely broke down. Then she pulled\nherself together to write to Lord Melbourne an account of all that had\nhappened, and of her own wretchedness. \"She feels,\" she said, \"Lord\nMelbourne will understand it, amongst enemies to those she most relied\non and most esteemed; but what is worst of all is the being deprived of\nseeing Lord Melbourne as she used to do.\"\nLord Melbourne replied with a very wise letter. He attempted to calm the\nQueen and to induce her to accept the new position gracefully; and he\nhad nothing but good words for the Tory leaders. As for the question of\nthe Ladies of the Household, the Queen, he said, should strongly urge\nwhat she desired, as it was a matter which concerned her personally,\n\"but,\" he added, \"if Sir Robert is unable to concede it, it will not do\nto refuse and to put off the negotiation upon it.\" On this point there\ncan be little doubt that Lord Melbourne was right. The question was\na complicated and subtle one, and it had never arisen before; but\nsubsequent constitutional practice has determined that a Queen Regnant\nmust accede to the wishes of her Prime Minister as to the personnel of\nthe female part of her Household. Lord Melbourne's wisdom, however, was\nwasted. The Queen would not be soothed, and still less would she take\nadvice. It was outrageous of the Tories to want to deprive her of her\nLadies, and that night she made up her mind that, whatever Sir Robert\nmight say, she would refuse to consent to the removal of a single one\nof them. Accordingly, when, next morning, Peel appeared again, she was\nready for action. He began by detailing the Cabinet appointments, and\nthen he added \"Now, ma'am, about the Ladies-\" when the Queen sharply\ninterrupted him. \"I cannot give up any of my Ladies,\" she said. \"What,\nma'am!\" said Sir Robert, \"does your Majesty mean to retain them all?\"\n\"All,\" said the Queen. Sir Robert's face worked strangely; he could not\nconceal his agitation. \"The Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of\nthe Bedchamber?\" he brought out at last. \"All,\" replied once more her\nMajesty. It was in vain that Peel pleaded and argued; in vain that\nhe spoke, growing every moment more pompous and uneasy, of the\nconstitution, and Queens Regnant, and the public interest; in vain that\nhe danced his pathetic minuet. She was adamant; but he, too, through all\nhis embarrassment, showed no sign of yielding; and when at last he left\nher nothing had been decided--the whole formation of the Government was\nhanging in the wind. A frenzy of excitement now seized upon Victoria.\nSir Robert, she believed in her fury, had tried to outwit her, to take\nher friends from her, to impose his will upon her own; but that was\nnot all: she had suddenly perceived, while the poor man was moving so\nuneasily before her, the one thing that she was desperately longing\nfor--a loop-hole of escape. She seized a pen and dashed off a note to\nLord Melbourne.\n\"Sir Robert has behaved very ill,\" she wrote, \"he insisted on my giving\nup my Ladies, to which I replied that I never would consent, and I never\nsaw a man so frightened... I was calm but very decided, and I think\nyou would have been pleased to see my composure and great firmness;\nthe Queen of England will not submit to such trickery. Keep yourself in\nreadiness, for you may soon be wanted.\" Hardly had she finished when the\nDuke of Wellington was announced. \"Well, Ma'am,\" he said as he entered,\n\"I am very sorry to find there is a difficulty.\" \"Oh!\" she instantly\nreplied, \"he began it, not me.\" She felt that only one thing now was\nneeded: she must be firm. And firm she was. The venerable conqueror\nof Napoleon was outfaced by the relentless equanimity of a girl in her\nteens. He could not move the Queen one inch. At last, she even ventured\nto rally him. \"Is Sir Robert so weak,\" she asked, \"that even the Ladies\nmust be of his opinion?\" On which the Duke made a brief and humble\nexpostulation, bowed low, and departed.\nHad she won? Time would show; and in the meantime she scribbled down\nanother letter. \"Lord Melbourne must not think the Queen rash in her\nconduct... The Queen felt this was an attempt to see whether she could\nbe led and managed like a child.\"(*) The Tories were not only wicked but\nridiculous. Peel, having, as she understood, expressed a wish to remove\nonly those members of the Household who were in Parliament, now objected\nto her Ladies. \"I should like to know,\" she exclaimed in triumphant\nscorn, \"if they mean to give the Ladies seats in Parliament?\"\n(*) The exclamation \"They wished to treat me like a girl,\nbut I will show them that I am Queen of England!\" often\nquoted as the Queen's, is apocryphal. It is merely part of\nGreville's summary of the two letters to Melbourne. It may\nbe noted that the phrase \"the Queen of England will not\nsubmit to such trickery\" is omitted in \"Girlhood,\" and in\ngeneral there are numerous verbal discrepancies between the\nversions of the journal and the letters in the two books.\nThe end of the crisis was now fast approaching. Sir Robert returned, and\ntold her that if she insisted upon retaining all her Ladies he could\nnot form a Government. She replied that she would send him her final\ndecision in writing. Next morning the late Whig Cabinet met. Lord\nMelbourne read to them the Queen's letters, and the group of elderly\npoliticians were overcome by an extraordinary wave of enthusiasm. They\nknew very well that, to say the least, it was highly doubtful whether\nthe Queen had acted in strict accordance with the constitution; that in\ndoing what she had done she had brushed aside Lord Melbourne's advice;\nthat, in reality, there was no public reason whatever why they should\ngo back upon their decision to resign. But such considerations vanished\nbefore the passionate urgency of Victoria. The intensity of her\ndetermination swept them headlong down the stream of her desire. They\nunanimously felt that \"it was impossible to abandon such a Queen\nand such a woman.\" Forgetting that they were no longer her Majesty's\nMinisters, they took the unprecedented course of advising the Queen by\nletter to put an end to her negotiation with Sir Robert Peel. She did\nso; all was over; she had triumphed. That evening there was a ball at\nthe Palace. Everyone was present. \"Peel and the Duke of Wellington came\nby looking very much put out.\" She was perfectly happy; Lord M. was\nPrime Minister once more, and he was by her side.",

The domestic imbroglio continued unabated, until at last\nthe Duke, rejected as a Minister, was called in once again in his old\ncapacity as moral physician to the family. Something was accomplished\nwhen, at last, he induced Sir John Conroy to resign his place about the\nDuchess of Kent and leave the Palace for ever; something more when he\npersuaded the Queen to write an affectionate letter to her mother. The\nway seemed open for a reconciliation, but the Duchess was stormy still.\nShe didn't believe that Victoria had written that letter; it was not\nin her handwriting; and she sent for the Duke to tell him so. The Duke,\nassuring her that the letter was genuine, begged her to forget the past.\nBut that was not so easy. \"What am I to do if Lord Melbourne comes up to\nme?\" \"Do, ma'am? Why, receive him with civility.\" Well, she would make\nan effort... \"But what am I to do if Victoria asks me to shake hands\nwith Lehzen?\" \"Do, ma'am? Why, take her in your arms and kiss her.\"\n\"What!\" The Duchess bristled in every feather, and then she burst into\na hearty laugh. \"No, ma'am, no,\" said the Duke, laughing too. \"I don't\nmean you are to take Lehzen in your arms and kiss her, but the\nQueen.\" The Duke might perhaps have succeeded, had not all attempts at\nconciliation been rendered hopeless by a tragical event. Lady Flora,\nit was discovered, had been suffering from a terrible internal malady,\nwhich now grew rapidly worse. There could be little doubt that she was\ndying. The Queen's unpopularity reached an extraordinary height. More\nthan once she was publicly insulted. \"Mrs. Melbourne,\" was shouted at\nher when she appeared at her balcony; and, at Ascot, she was hissed\nby the Duchess of Montrose and Lady Sarah Ingestre as she passed. Lady\nFlora died. The whole scandal burst out again with redoubled vehemence;\nwhile, in the Palace, the two parties were henceforth divided by an\nimpassable, a Stygian, gulf.\nNevertheless, Lord M. was back, and every trouble faded under the\nenchantment of his presence and his conversation. He, on his side,\nhad gone through much; and his distresses were intensified by a\nconsciousness of his own shortcomings. He realised clearly enough that,\nif he had intervened at the right moment, the Hastings scandal might\nhave been averted; and, in the bedchamber crisis, he knew that he had\nallowed his judgment to be overruled and his conduct to be swayed by\nprivate feelings and the impetuosity of Victoria. But he was not one\nto suffer too acutely from the pangs of conscience. In spite of the\ndullness and the formality of the Court, his relationship with the\nQueen had come to be the dominating interest in his life; to have been\ndeprived of it would have been heartrending; that dread eventuality\nhad been--somehow--avoided; he was installed once more, in a kind of\ntriumph; let him enjoy the fleeting hours to the full!

To watch, to teach, to restrain, to encourage the royal\nyoung creature beside him--that was much; to feel with such a constant\nintimacy the impact of her quick affection, her radiant vitality--that\nwas more; most of all, perhaps, was it good to linger vaguely in\nhumorous contemplation, in idle apostrophe, to talk disconnectedly, to\nmake a little joke about an apple or a furbelow, to dream. The springs\nof his sensibility, hidden deep within him, were overflowing. Often, as\nhe bent over her hand and kissed it, he found himself in tears.\nUpon Victoria, with all her impermeability, it was inevitable that such\na companionship should have produced, eventually, an effect.

Lord Melbourne with his gentle\ninstruction had sought to lead her into the paths of wisdom and\nmoderation, but the whole unconscious movement of his character had\nswayed her in a very different direction. The hard clear pebble,\nsubjected for so long and so constantly to that encircling and insidious\nfluidity, had suffered a curious corrosion; it seemed to be actually\ngrowing a little soft and a little clouded. Humanity and fallibility are\ninfectious things; was it possible that Lehzen's prim pupil had caught\nthem? That she was beginning to listen to siren voices? That the secret\nimpulses of self-expression, of self-indulgence even, were mastering\nher life? For a moment the child of a new age looked back, and wavered\ntowards the eighteenth century. It was the most critical moment of her\ncareer. Had those influences lasted, the development of her character,\nthe history of her life, would have been completely changed.\nAnd why should they not last? She, for one, was very anxious that they\nshould. Let them last for ever! She was surrounded by Whigs, she was\nfree to do whatever she wanted, she had Lord M.; she could not believe\nthat she could ever be happier. Any change would be for the worse; and\nthe worst change of all... no, she would not hear of it; it would be\nquite intolerable, it would upset everything, if she were to marry. And\nyet everyone seemed to want her to--the general public, the Ministers,\nher Saxe-Coburg relations--it was always the same story. Of course, she\nknew very well that there were excellent reasons for it. For one thing,\nif she remained childless, and were to die, her uncle Cumberland, who\nwas now the King of Hanover, would succeed to the Throne of England.\nThat, no doubt, would be a most unpleasant event; and she entirely\nsympathised with everybody who wished to avoid it. But there was no\nhurry; naturally, she would marry in the end--but not just yet--not for\nthree or four years. What was tiresome was that her uncle Leopold had\napparently determined, not only that she ought to marry, but that her\ncousin Albert ought to be her husband. That was very like her uncle\nLeopold, who wanted to have a finger in every pie; and it was true that\nlong ago, in far-off days, before her accession even, she had written to\nhim in a way which might well have encouraged him in such a notion. She\nhad told him then that Albert possessed \"every quality that could be\ndesired to render her perfectly happy,\" and had begged her \"dearest\nuncle to take care of the health of one, now so dear to me, and to take\nhim under your special protection,\" adding, \"I hope and trust all will\ngo on prosperously and well on this subject of so much importance to\nme.\" But that had been years ago, when she was a mere child; perhaps,\nindeed, to judge from the language, the letter had been dictated by\nLehzen; at any rate, her feelings, and all the circumstances, had now\nentirely changed. Albert hardly interested her at all.\nIn later life the Queen declared that she had never for a moment dreamt\nof marrying anyone but her cousin; her letters and diaries tell a very\ndifferent story. On August 26, 1837, she wrote in her journal: \"To-day\nis my dearest cousin Albert's 18th birthday, and I pray Heaven to pour\nits choicest blessings on his beloved head!\" In the subsequent years,\nhowever, the date passes unnoticed. It had been arranged that Stockmar\nshould accompany the Prince to Italy, and the faithful Baron left her\nside for that purpose. He wrote to her more than once with sympathetic\ndescriptions of his young companion; but her mind was by this time made\nup. She liked and admired Albert very much, but she did not want to\nmarry him. \"At present,\" she told Lord Melbourne in April, 1839, \"my\nfeeling is quite against ever marrying.\" When her cousin's Italian tour\ncame to an end, she began to grow nervous; she knew that, according to a\nlong-standing engagement, his next journey would be to England. He would\nprobably arrive in the autumn, and by July her uneasiness was intense.\nShe determined to write to her uncle, in order to make her position\nclear. It must be understood she said, that \"there is no no engagement\nbetween us.\" If she should like Albert, she could \"make no final promise\nthis year, for, at the very earliest, any such event could not take\nplace till two or three years hence.\" She had, she said, \"a great\nrepugnance\" to change her present position; and, if she should not like\nhim, she was \"very anxious that it should be understood that she would\nnot be guilty of any breach of promise, for she never gave any.\" To Lord\nMelbourne she was more explicit. She told him that she \"had no great\nwish to see Albert, as the whole subject was an odious one;\" she hated\nto have to decide about it; and she repeated once again that seeing\nAlbert would be \"a disagreeable thing.\" But there was no escaping the\nhorrid business; the visit must be made, and she must see him. The\nsummer slipped by and was over; it was the autumn already; on the\nevening of October 10 Albert, accompanied by his brother Ernest, arrived\nat Windsor.\nAlbert arrived; and the whole structure of her existence crumbled into\nnothingness like a house of cards. He was beautiful--she gasped--she\nknew no more. Then, in a flash, a thousand mysteries were revealed to\nher; the past, the present, rushed upon her with a new significance; the\ndelusions of years were abolished, and an extraordinary, an irresistible\ncertitude leapt into being in the light of those blue eyes, the smile\nof that lovely mouth. The succeeding hours passed in a rapture. She was\nable to observe a few more details--the \"exquisite nose,\" the \"delicate\nmoustachios and slight but very slight whiskers,\" the \"beautiful figure,\nbroad in the shoulders and a fine waist.\" She rode with him, danced with\nhim, talked with him, and it was all perfection. She had no shadow of\na doubt. He had come on a Thursday evening, and on the following Sunday\nmorning she told Lord Melbourne that she had \"a good deal changed her\nopinion as to marrying.\" Next morning, she told him that she had made\nup her mind to marry Albert. The morning after that, she sent for her\ncousin. She received him alone, and \"after a few minutes I said to him\nthat I thought he must be aware why I wished them to come here--and\nthat it would make me too happy if he would consent to what I wished\n(to marry me.)\" Then \"we embraced each other, and he was so kind, so\naffectionate.\" She said that she was quite unworthy of him, while he\nmurmured that he would be very happy \"Das Leben mit dir zu zubringen.\"\nThey parted, and she felt \"the happiest of human beings,\" when Lord M.\ncame in. At first she beat about the bush, and talked of the weather,\nand indifferent subjects. Somehow or other she felt a little nervous\nwith her old friend. At last, summoning up her courage, she said, \"I\nhave got well through this with Albert.\" \"Oh! you have,\" said Lord M.\nCHAPTER",

            "text": "I\nIt was decidedly a family match. Prince Francis Charles Augustus Albert\nEmmanuel of Saxe-Coburg--Gotha--for such was his full title--had been\nborn just three months after his cousin Victoria, and the same midwife\nhad assisted at the two births. The children's grandmother, the Dowager\nDuchess of Coburg, had from the first looked forward to their marriage,\nas they grew up, the Duke, the Duchess of Kent, and King Leopold came\nequally to desire it. The Prince, ever since the time when, as a child\nof three, his nurse had told him that some day \"the little English May\nflower\" would be his wife, had never thought of marrying anyone else.\nWhen eventually Baron Stockmar himself signified his assent, the affair\nseemed as good as settled.\nThe Duke had one other child--Prince Ernest, Albert's senior by one\nyear, and heir to the principality. The Duchess was a sprightly and\nbeautiful woman, with fair hair and blue eyes; Albert was very like her\nand was her declared favourite. But in his fifth year he was parted from\nher for ever. The ducal court was not noted for the strictness of its\nmorals; the Duke was a man of gallantry, and it was rumoured that the\nDuchess followed her husband's example. There were scandals: one of the\nCourt Chamberlains, a charming and cultivated man of Jewish extraction,\nwas talked of; at last there was a separation, followed by a divorce.\nThe Duchess retired to Paris, and died unhappily in 1831. Her memory was\nalways very dear to Albert.\nHe grew up a pretty, clever, and high-spirited boy. Usually\nwell-behaved, he was, however, sometimes violent. He had a will of\nhis own, and asserted it; his elder brother was less passionate, less\npurposeful, and, in their wrangles, it was Albert who came out top. The\ntwo boys, living for the most part in one or other of the Duke's country\nhouses, among pretty hills and woods and streams, had been at a very\nearly age--Albert was less than four--separated from their nurses and\nput under a tutor, in whose charge they remained until they went to the\nUniversity. They were brought up in a simple and unostentatious manner,\nfor the Duke was poor and the duchy very small and very insignificant.\nBefore long it became evident that Albert was a model lad. Intelligent\nand painstaking, he had been touched by the moral earnestness of his\ngeneration; at the age of eleven he surprised his father by telling him\nthat he hoped to make himself \"a good and useful man.\" And yet he was\nnot over-serious; though, perhaps, he had little humour, he was full\nof fun--of practical jokes and mimicry. He was no milksop; he rode, and\nshot, and fenced; above all did he delight in being out of doors, and\nnever was he happier than in his long rambles with his brother through\nthe wild country round his beloved Rosenau--stalking the deer, admiring\nthe scenery, and returning laden with specimens for his natural\nhistory collection. He was, besides, passionately fond of music. In one\nparticular it was observed that he did not take after his father: owing\neither to his peculiar upbringing or to a more fundamental idiosyncrasy\nhe had a marked distaste for the opposite sex. At the age of five, at a\nchildren's dance, he screamed with disgust and anger when a little girl\nwas led up to him for a partner; and though, later on, he grew more\nsuccessful in disguising such feelings, the feelings remained.\nThe brothers were very popular in Coburg, and, when the time came for\nthem to be confirmed, the preliminary examination which, according to\nancient custom, was held in public in the \"Giants' Hall\" of the\nCastle, was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of functionaries, clergy,\ndelegates from the villages of the duchy, and miscellaneous onlookers.\nThere were also present, besides the Duke and the Dowager Duchess, their\nSerene Highnesses the Princes Alexander and Ernest of Wurtemberg,\nPrince Leiningen, Princess Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and Princess\nHohenlohe-Schillingsfurst. Dr. Jacobi, the Court chaplain, presided at\nan altar, simply but appropriately decorated, which had been placed at\nthe end of the hall; and the proceedings began by the choir singing the\nfirst verse of the hymn, \"Come, Holy Ghost.\" After some introductory\nremarks, Dr. Jacobi began the examination. \"The dignified and decorous\nbearing of the Princes,\" we are told in a contemporary account,\n\"their strict attention to the questions, the frankness, decision, and\ncorrectness of their answers, produced a deep impression on the numerous\nassembly. Nothing was more striking in their answers than the evidence\nthey gave of deep feeling and of inward strength of conviction. The\nquestions put by the examiner were not such as to be met by a simple\n'yes' or 'no.' They were carefully considered in order to give the\naudience a clear insight into the views and feelings of,the young\nprinces. One of the most touching moments was when the examiner asked\nthe hereditary prince whether he intended steadfastly to hold to the\nEvangelical Church, and the Prince answered not only 'Yes!' but added in\na clear and decided tone: 'I and my brother are firmly resolved ever\nto remain faithful to the acknowledged truth.' The examination having\nlasted an hour, Dr. Jacobi made some concluding observations, followed\nby a short prayer; the second and third verses of the opening hymn were\nsung; and the ceremony was over. The Princes, stepping down from the\naltar, were embraced by the Duke and the Dowager Duchess; after which\nthe loyal inhabitants of Coburg dispersed, well satisfied with their\nentertainment.\"",

            "text": "Albert's mental development now proceeded apace. In his seventeenth year\nhe began a careful study of German literature and German philosophy.\nHe set about, he told his tutor, \"to follow the thoughts of the great\nKlopstock into their depths--though in this, for the most part,\" he\nmodestly added, \"I do not succeed.\" He wrote an essay on the \"Mode\nof Thought of the Germans, and a Sketch of the History of German\nCivilisation,\" \"making use,\" he said, \"in its general outlines, of\nthe divisions which the treatment of the subject itself demands,\" and\nconcluding with \"a retrospect of the shortcomings of our time, with an\nappeal to every one to correct those shortcomings in his own case, and\nthus set a good example to others.\" Placed for some months under the\ncare of King Leopold at Brussels, he came under the influence of Adolphe\nQuetelet, a mathematical professor, who was particularly interested\nin the application of the laws of probability to political and moral\nphenomena; this line of inquiry attracted the Prince, and the friendship\nthus begun continued till the end of his life. From Brussels he went to\nthe University of Bonn, where he was speedily distinguished both by his\nintellectual and his social activities; his energies were absorbed\nin metaphysics, law, political economy, music, fencing, and amateur\ntheatricals. Thirty years later his fellow--students recalled with\ndelight the fits of laughter into which they had been sent by Prince\nAlbert's mimicry. The verve with which his Serene Highness reproduced\nthe tones and gestures of one of the professors who used to point to\na picture of a row of houses in Venice with the remark, \"That is the\nPonte-Realte,\" and of another who fell down in a race and was obliged to\nlook for his spectacles, was especially appreciated.\nAfter a year at Bonn, the time had come for a foreign tour, and Baron\nStockmar arrived from England to accompany the Prince on an expedition\nto Italy. The Baron had been already, two years previously, consulted\nby King Leopold as to his views upon the proposed marriage of Albert\nand Victoria. His reply had been remarkable. With a characteristic\nforesight, a characteristic absence of optimism, a characteristic sense\nof the moral elements in the situation, Stockmar had pointed out what\nwere, in his opinion, the conditions essential to make the marriage a\nsuccess. Albert, he wrote, \"was a fine young fellow, well grown for his\nage, with agreeable and valuable qualities; and it was probable that\nin a few years he would turn out a strong handsome man, of a kindly,\nsimple, yet dignified demeanour. Thus, externally, he possesses\nall that pleases the sex, and at all times and in all countries must\nplease.\" Supposing, therefore, that Victoria herself was in favour of\nthe marriage, the further question arose as to whether Albert's mental\nqualities were such as to fit him for the position of husband of the\nQueen of England. On this point, continued the Baron, one heard much to\nhis credit; the Prince was said to be discreet and intelligent; but\nall such judgments were necessarily partial, and the Baron preferred to\nreserve his opinion until he could come to a trustworthy conclusion from\npersonal observation. And then he added: \"But all this is not enough.\nThe young man ought to have not merely great ability, but a right\nambition, and great force of will as well. To pursue for a lifetime a\npolitical career so arduous demands more than energy and inclination--it\ndemands also that earnest frame of mind which is ready of its own accord\nto sacrifice mere pleasure to real usefulness. If he is not satisfied\nhereafter with the consciousness of having achieved one of the most\ninfluential positions in Europe, how often will he feel tempted to\nrepent his adventure! If he does not from the very outset accept it as a\nvocation of grave responsibility, on the efficient performance of\nwhich his honour and happiness depend, there is small likelihood of his\nsucceeding.\"\nSuch were the views of Stockmar on the qualifications necessary for the\ndue fulfilment of that destiny which Albert's family had marked out for\nhim; and he hoped, during the tour in Italy, to come to some conclusion\nas to how far the prince possessed them. Albert on his side was much",

Albert, he said, was intelligent,\nkind, and amiable; he was full of the best intentions and the noblest\nresolutions, and his judgment was in many things beyond his years. But\ngreat exertion was repugnant to him; he seemed to be too willing to\nspare himself, and his good resolutions too often came to nothing. It\nwas particularly unfortunate that he took not the slightest interest\nin politics, and never read a newspaper. In his manners, too, there was\nstill room for improvement. \"He will always,\" said the Baron, \"have more\nsuccess with men than with women, in whose society he shows too little\nempressement, and is too indifferent and retiring.\" One other feature\nof the case was noted by the keen eye of the old physician: the Prince's\nconstitution was not a strong one.

The wheel of fortune turned\nwith a sudden rapidity; and he found, in the arms of Victoria, the\nirrevocable assurance of his overwhelming fate.\nII\nHe was not in love with her. Affection, gratitude, the natural reactions\nto the unqualified devotion of a lively young cousin who was also\na queen--such feelings possessed him, but the ardours of reciprocal\npassion were not his. Though he found that he liked Victoria very much,\nwhat immediately interested him in his curious position was less her\nthan himself. Dazzled and delighted, riding, dancing, singing, laughing,\namid the splendours of Windsor, he was aware of a new sensation--the\nstirrings of ambition in his breast. His place would indeed be a high,\nan enviable one! And then, on the instant, came another thought. The\nteaching of religion, the admonitions of Stockmar, his own inmost\nconvictions, all spoke with the same utterance. He would not be there to\nplease himself, but for a very different purpose--to do good. He must be\n\"noble, manly, and princely in all things,\" he would have \"to live and\nto sacrifice himself for the benefit of his new country;\" to \"use his\npowers and endeavours for a great object--that of promoting the welfare\nof multitudes of his fellowmen.\" One serious thought led on to another.\nThe wealth and the bustle of the English Court might be delightful for\nthe moment, but, after all, it was Coburg that had his heart. \"While\nI shall be untiring,\" he wrote to his grandmother, \"in my efforts and\nlabours for the country to which I shall in future belong, and where\nI am called to so high a position, I shall never cease ein treuer\nDeutscher, Coburger, Gothaner zu sein.\" And now he must part from Coburg\nfor ever! Sobered and sad, he sought relief in his brother Ernest's\ncompany; the two young men would shut themselves up together, and,\nsitting down at the pianoforte, would escape from the present and the\nfuture in the sweet familiar gaiety of a Haydn duet.\nThey returned to Germany; and while Albert, for a few farewell months,\nenjoyed, for the last time, the happiness of home, Victoria, for the\nlast time, resumed her old life in London and Windsor. She corresponded\ndaily with her future husband in a mingled flow of German and English;\nbut the accustomed routine reasserted itself; the business and the\npleasures of the day would brook no interruption; Lord M. was once\nmore constantly beside her; and the Tories were as intolerable as ever.\nIndeed, they were more so. For now, in these final moments, the old feud\nburst out with redoubled fury. The impetuous sovereign found, to her\nchagrin, that there might be disadvantages in being the declared enemy\nof one of the great parties in the State. On two occasions, the Tories\ndirectly thwarted her in a matter on which she had set her heart. She\nwished her husband's rank to be axed by statute, and their opposition\nprevented it. She wished her husband to receive a settlement from the\nnation of L50,000 a year; and, again owing to the Tories, he was only\nallowed L30,000. It was too bad. When the question was discussed in\nParliament, it had been pointed out that the bulk of the population was\nsuffering from great poverty, and that L30,000 was the whole revenue of\nCoburg; but her uncle Leopold had been given L50,000, and it would\nbe monstrous to give Albert less. Sir Robert Peel--it might have been\nexpected--had had the effrontery to speak and vote for the smaller sum.\nShe was very angry; and determined to revenge herself by omitting to\ninvite a single Tory to her wedding. She would make an exception in\nfavour of old Lord Liverpool, but even the Duke of Wellington she\nrefused to ask. When it was represented to her that it would amount to\na national scandal if the Duke were absent from her wedding, she was\nangrier than ever. \"What! That old rebel! I won't have him:\" she\nwas reported to have said. Eventually she was induced to send him an\ninvitation; but she made no attempt to conceal the bitterness of her\nfeelings, and the Duke himself was only too well aware of all that had",

Queen Adelaide annoyed her. King Leopold, too, was\n\"ungracious\" in his correspondence; \"Dear Uncle,\" she told Albert, \"is\ngiven to believe that he must rule the roost everywhere. However,\" she\nadded with asperity, \"that is not a necessity.\" Even Albert himself\nwas not impeccable. Engulfed in Coburgs, he failed to appreciate\nthe complexity of English affairs. There were difficulties about his\nhousehold. He had a notion that he ought not to be surrounded by\nviolent Whigs; very likely, but he would not understand that the only\nalternatives to violent Whigs were violent Tories; and it would be\npreposterous if his Lords and Gentlemen were to be found voting against\nthe Queen's. He wanted to appoint his own Private Secretary. But how\ncould he choose the right person? Lord M. was obviously best qualified\nto make the appointment; and Lord M. had decided that the Prince should\ntake over his own Private Secretary--George Anson, a staunch Whig.\nAlbert protested, but it was useless; Victoria simply announced that\nAnson was appointed, and instructed Lehzen to send the Prince an\nexplanation of the details of the case.\nThen, again, he had written anxiously upon the necessity of maintaining\nunspotted the moral purity of the Court. Lord M's pupil considered that\ndear Albert was strait-laced, and, in a brisk Anglo-German missive, set\nforth her own views. \"I like Lady A. very much,\" she told him, \"only she\nis a little strict awl particular, and too severe towards others, which\nis not right; for I think one ought always to be indulgent towards other\npeople, as I always think, if we had not been well taken care of, we\nmight also have gone astray. That is always my feeling. Yet it is always\nright to show that one does not like to see what is obviously wrong; but\nit is very dangerous to be too severe, and I am certain that as a rule\nsuch people always greatly regret that in their youth they have not been\nso careful as they ought to have been. I have explained this so badly\nand written it so badly, that I fear you will hardly be able to make it\nout.\"\nOn one other matter she was insistent. Since the affair of Lady Flora\nHastings, a sad fate had overtaken Sir James Clark. His flourishing\npractice had quite collapsed; nobody would go to him any more. But the\nQueen remained faithful. She would show the world how little she cared\nfor their disapproval, and she desired Albert to make \"poor Clark\" his\nphysician in ordinary. He did as he was told; but, as it turned out, the\nappointment was not a happy one.",

            "text": "III\nAlbert had foreseen that his married life would not be all plain\nsailing; but he had by no means realised the gravity and the\ncomplication of the difficulties which he would have to face.\nPolitically, he was a cipher. Lord Melbourne was not only Prime\nMinister, he was in effect the Private Secretary of the Queen, and thus\ncontrolled the whole of the political existence of the sovereign. A\nqueen's husband was an entity unknown to the British Constitution. In\nState affairs there seemed to be no place for him; nor was Victoria\nherself at all unwilling that this should be so. \"The English,\" she had\ntold the Prince when, during their engagement, a proposal had been made\nto give him a peerage, \"are very jealous of any foreigner interfering in\nthe government of this country, and have already in some of the papers\nexpressed a hope that you would not interfere. Now, though I know you\nnever would, still, if you were a Peer, they would all say, the Prince\nmeant to play a political part. I know you never would!\" In reality, she\nwas not quite so certain; but she wished Albert to understand her views.\nHe would, she hoped, make a perfect husband; but, as for governing the\ncountry, he would see that she and Lord M. between them could manage\nthat very well, without his help.\nBut it was not only in politics that the Prince discovered that the part\ncut out for him was a negligible one. Even as a husband, he found, his\nfunctions were to be of an extremely limited kind. Over the whole of\nVictoria's private life the Baroness reigned supreme; and she had not\nthe slightest intention of allowing that supremacy to be diminished by\none iota. Since the accession, her power had greatly increased. Besides\nthe undefined and enormous influence which she exercised through her\nmanagement of the Queen's private correspondence, she was now the\nsuperintendent of the royal establishment and controlled the important\noffice of Privy Purse. Albert very soon perceived that he was not master\nin his own house. Every detail of his own and his wife's existence was\nsupervised by a third person: nothing could be done until the consent\nof Lehzen had first been obtained. And Victoria, who adored Lehzen with\nunabated intensity, saw nothing in all this that was wrong.\nNor was the Prince happier in his social surroundings. A shy young\nforeigner, awkward in ladies' company, unexpansive and self-opinionated,\nit was improbable that, in any circumstances, he would have been a\nsociety success. His appearance, too, was against him. Though in the\neyes of Victoria he was the mirror of manly beauty, her subjects, whose\neyes were of a less Teutonic cast, did not agree with her. To them--and\nparticularly to the high-born ladies and gentlemen who naturally saw him\nmost--what was immediately and distressingly striking in Albert's face\nand figure and whole demeanour was his un-English look. His features\nwere regular, no doubt, but there was something smooth and smug about\nthem; he was tall, but he was clumsily put together, and he walked with\na slight slouch. Really, they thought, this youth was more like\nsome kind of foreign tenor than anything else. These were serious\ndisadvantages; but the line of conduct which the Prince adopted from\nthe first moment of his arrival was far from calculated to dispel\nthem. Owing partly to a natural awkwardness, partly to a fear of undue\nfamiliarity, and partly to a desire to be absolutely correct, his\nmanners were infused with an extraordinary stiffness and formality.\nWhenever he appeared in company, he seemed to be surrounded by a thick\nhedge of prickly etiquette. He never went out into ordinary society; he\nnever walked in the streets of London; he was invariably accompanied by\nan equerry when he rode or drove. He wanted to be irreproachable and, if\nthat involved friendlessness, it could not be helped. Besides, he had no\nvery high opinion of the English. So far as he could see, they cared for\nnothing but fox-hunting and Sunday observances; they oscillated between\nan undue frivolity and an undue gloom; if you spoke to them of friendly\njoyousness they stared; and they did not understand either the Laws of\nThought or the wit of a German University. Since it was clear that with\nsuch people he could have very little in common, there was no reason\nwhatever for relaxing in their favour the rules of etiquette. In strict\nprivacy, he could be natural and charming; Seymour and Anson were\ndevoted to him, and he returned their affection; but they were\nsubordinates--the receivers of his confidences and the agents of his\nwill. From the support and the solace of true companionship he was\nutterly cut off.\nA friend, indeed, he had--or rather, a mentor. The Baron, established\nonce more in the royal residence, was determined to work with as\nwholehearted a detachment for the Prince's benefit as, more than twenty\nyears before, he had worked for his uncle's. The situations then and\nnow, similar in many respects, were yet full of differences. Perhaps in\neither case the difficulties to be encountered were equally great; but\nthe present problem was the more complex and the more interesting. The\nyoung doctor who, unknown and insignificant, had nothing at the back of\nhim but his own wits and the friendship of an unimportant Prince, had\nbeen replaced by the accomplished confidant of kings and ministers, ripe\nin years, in reputation, and in the wisdom of a vast experience. It\nwas possible for him to treat Albert with something of the affectionate\nauthority of a father; but, on the other hand, Albert was no Leopold.\nAs the Baron was very well aware, he had none of his uncle's rigidity of\nambition, none of his overweening impulse to be personally great. He was\nvirtuous and well-intentioned; he was clever and well-informed; but he\ntook no interest in politics, and there were no signs that he possessed\nany commanding force of character. Left to himself, he would almost\ncertainly have subsided into a high-minded nonentity, an aimless\ndilettante busy over culture, a palace appendage without influence or\npower. But he was not left to himself: Stockmar saw to that. For ever\nat his pupil's elbow, the hidden Baron pushed him forward, with tireless\npressure, along the path which had been trod by Leopold so many years\nago. But, this time, the goal at the end of it was something more than\nthe mediocre royalty that Leopold had reached. The prize which Stockmar,\nwith all the energy of disinterested devotion, had determined should be\nAlbert's was a tremendous prize indeed.",

            "text": "The beginning of the undertaking proved to be the most arduous part\nof it. Albert was easily dispirited: what was the use of struggling to\nperform in a role which bored him and which, it was quite clear, nobody\nbut the dear good Baron had any desire that he should take up? It was\nsimpler, and it saved a great deal of trouble, to let things slide.\nBut Stockmar would not have it. Incessantly, he harped upon two\nstrings--Albert's sense of duty and his personal pride. Had the Prince\nforgotten the noble aims to which his life was to be devoted? And was he\ngoing to allow himself, his wife, his family, his whole existence, to be\ngoverned by Baroness Lehzen? The latter consideration was a potent one.\nAlbert had never been accustomed to giving way; and now, more than ever\nbefore, it would be humiliating to do so. Not only was he constantly\nexasperated by the position of the Baroness in the royal household;\nthere was another and a still more serious cause of complaint. He was,\nhe knew very well, his wife's intellectual superior, and yet he found,\nto his intense annoyance, that there were parts of her mind over which\nhe exercised no influence. When, urged on by the Baron, he attempted\nto discuss politics with Victoria, she eluded the subject, drifted into\ngeneralities, and then began to talk of something else. She was treating\nhim as she had once treated their uncle Leopold. When at last he\nprotested, she replied that her conduct was merely the result of\nindolence; that when she was with him she could not bear to bother her\nhead with anything so dull as politics. The excuse was worse than the\nfault: was he the wife and she the husband? It almost seemed so. But the\nBaron declared that the root of the mischief was Lehzen: that it was she\nwho encouraged the Queen to have secrets; who did worse--undermined\nthe natural ingenuousness of Victoria, and induced her to give,\nunconsciously no doubt, false reasons to explain away her conduct.\nMinor disagreements made matters worse. The royal couple differed in\ntheir tastes. Albert, brought up in a regime of Spartan simplicity and\nearly hours, found the great Court functions intolerably wearisome,\nand was invariably observed to be nodding on the sofa at half-past ten;\nwhile the Queen's favourite form of enjoyment was to dance through the\nnight, and then, going out into the portico of the Palace, watch the sun\nrise behind St. Paul's and the towers of Westminster. She loved London\nand he detested it. It was only in Windsor that he felt he could really\nbreathe; but Windsor too had its terrors: though during the day there\nhe could paint and walk and play on the piano, after dinner black tedium\ndescended like a pall. He would have liked to summon distinguished\nscientific and literary men to his presence, and after ascertaining\ntheir views upon various points of art and learning, to set forth his\nown; but unfortunately Victoria \"had no fancy to encourage such people;\"\nknowing that she was unequal to taking a part in their conversation,\nshe insisted that the evening routine should remain unaltered; the\nregulation interchange of platitudes with official persons was followed\nas usual by the round table and the books of engravings, while the\nPrince, with one of his attendants, played game after game of double\nchess.\nIt was only natural that in so peculiar a situation, in which the\nelements of power, passion, and pride were so strangely apportioned,\nthere should have been occasionally something more than mere\nirritation--a struggle of angry wills. Victoria, no more than Albert,\nwas in the habit of playing second fiddle. Her arbitrary temper flashed\nout. Her vitality, her obstinacy, her overweening sense of her own\nposition, might well have beaten down before them his superiorities and\nhis rights. But she fought at a disadvantage; she was, in very truth, no\nlonger her own mistress; a profound preoccupation dominated her, seizing\nupon her inmost purposes for its own extraordinary ends. She was madly\nin love. The details of those curious battles are unknown to us; but\nPrince Ernest, who remained in England with his brother for some\nmonths, noted them with a friendly and startled eye. One story, indeed,\nsurvives, ill-authenticated and perhaps mythical, yet summing up, as\nsuch stories often do, the central facts of the case. When, in wrath,\nthe Prince one day had locked himself into his room, Victoria, no less\nfurious, knocked on the door to be admitted. \"Who is there?\" he asked.\n\"The Queen of England\" was the answer. He did not move, and again there\nwas a hail of knocks. The question and the answer were repeated many\ntimes; but at last there was a pause, and then a gentler knocking. \"Who\nis there?\" came once more the relentless question. But this time the\nreply was different. \"Your wife, Albert.\" And the door was immediately\nopened.\nVery gradually the Prince's position changed. He began to find the study\nof politics less uninteresting than he had supposed; he read Blackstone,\nand took lessons in English Law; he was occasionally present when the\nQueen interviewed her Ministers; and at Lord Melbourne's suggestion he\nwas shown all the despatches relating to Foreign Affairs. Sometimes\nhe would commit his views to paper, and read them aloud to the Prime\nMinister, who, infinitely kind and courteous, listened with attention,\nbut seldom made any reply. An important step was taken when, before\nthe birth of the Princess Royal, the Prince, without any opposition\nin Parliament, was appointed Regent in case of the death of the Queen.\nStockmar, owing to whose intervention with the Tories this happy result\nhad been brought about, now felt himself at liberty to take a holiday\nwith his family in Coburg; but his solicitude, poured out in innumerable\nletters, still watched over his pupil from afar. \"Dear Prince,\" he\nwrote, \"I am satisfied with the news you have sent me. Mistakes,\nmisunderstandings, obstructions, which come in vexatious opposition\nto one's views, are always to be taken for just what they are--namely,\nnatural phenomena of life, which represent one of its sides, and\nthat the shady one. In overcoming them with dignity, your mind has to\nexercise, to train, to enlighten itself; and your character to gain\nforce, endurance, and the necessary hardness.\" The Prince had done well\nso far; but he must continue in the right path; above all, he was \"never\nto relax.\" \"Never to relax in putting your magnanimity to the proof;\nnever to relax in logical separation of what is great and essential from\nwhat is trivial and of no moment; never to relax in keeping yourself\nup to a high standard--in the determination, daily renewed, to be\nconsistent, patient, courageous.\" It was a hard programme perhaps, for a\nyoung man of twenty-one; and yet there was something in it which touched\nthe very depths of Albert's soul. He sighed, but he listened--listened\nas to the voice of a spiritual director inspired with divine truth. \"The\nstars which are needful to you now,\" the voice continued, \"and perhaps\nfor some time to come, are Love, Honesty, Truth. All those whose minds\nare warped, or who are destitute of true feeling, will BE APT TO MISTAKE\nYOU, and to persuade themselves and the world that you are not the man\nyou are--or, at least, may become... Do you, therefore, be on the alert\nbe times, with your eyes open in every direction... I wish for my Prince\na great, noble, warm, and true heart, such as shall serve as the richest\nand surest basis for the noblest views of human nature, and the firmest\nresolve to give them development.\"\nBefore long, the decisive moment came. There was a General Election, and\nit became certain that the Tories, at last, must come into power. The\nQueen disliked them as much as ever; but, with a large majority in the\nHouse of Commons, they would now be in a position to insist upon their\nwishes being attended to. Lord Melbourne himself was the first to\nrealise the importance of carrying out the inevitable transition with as\nlittle friction as possible; and with his consent, the Prince, following\nup the rapprochement which had begun over the Regency Act, opened,\nthrough Anson, a negotiation with Sir Robert Peel. In a series of secret\ninterviews, a complete understanding was reached upon the difficult\nand complex question of the Bedchamber. It was agreed that the\nconstitutional point should not be raised, but that on the formation of\nthe Tory Government, the principal Whig ladies should retire, and their\nplaces be filled by others appointed by Sir Robert. Thus, in effect,\nthough not in form, the Crown abandoned the claims of 1839, and they\nhave never been subsequently put forward. The transaction was a turning\npoint in the Prince's career. He had conducted an important negotiation\nwith skill and tact; he had been brought into close and friendly\nrelations with the new Prime Minister; it was obvious that a great\npolitical future lay before him. Victoria was much impressed and deeply\ngrateful. \"My dearest Angel,\" she told King Leopold, \"is indeed a great\ncomfort to me. He takes the greatest interest in what goes on, feeling\nwith and for me, and yet abstaining as he ought from biasing me either\nway, though we talk much on the subject, and his judgment is, as you\nsay, good and mild.\" She was in need of all the comfort and assistance\nhe could give her. Lord M. was going, and she could hardly bring herself\nto speak to Peel. Yes; she would discuss everything with Albert now!\nStockmar, who had returned to England, watched the departure of Lord\nMelbourne with satisfaction. If all went well, the Prince should now\nwield a supreme political influence over Victoria. But would all go\nwell?? An unexpected development put the Baron into a serious fright.\nWhen the dreadful moment finally came, and the Queen, in anguish, bade\nadieu to her beloved Minister, it was settled between them that, though\nit would be inadvisable to meet very often, they could continue to\ncorrespond. Never were the inconsistencies of Lord Melbourne's character\nshown more clearly than in what followed. So long as he was in office,\nhis attitude towards Peel had been irreproachable; he had done all he\ncould to facilitate the change of government, he had even, through more\nthan one channel, transmitted privately to his successful rival advice\nas to the best means of winning the Queen's good graces. Yet, no sooner\nwas he in opposition than his heart failed him. He could not bear the\nthought of surrendering altogether the privilege and the pleasure of\ngiving counsel to Victoria--of being cut off completely from the power\nand the intimacy which had been his for so long and in such abundant\nmeasure. Though he had declared that he would be perfectly discreet in\nhis letters, he could not resist taking advantage of the opening they\nafforded. He discussed in detail various public questions, and, in\nparticular, gave the Queen a great deal of advice in the matter of\nappointments. This advice was followed. Lord Melbourne recommended\nthat Lord Heytesbury, who, he said, was an able man, should be made\nAmbassador at Vienna; and a week later the Queen wrote to the Foreign\nSecretary urging that Lord Heytesbury, whom she believed to be a very\nable man, should be employed \"on some important mission.\" Stockmar\nwas very much alarmed. He wrote a memorandum, pointing out the\nunconstitutional nature of Lord Melbourne's proceedings and the\nunpleasant position in which the Queen might find herself if they were\ndiscovered by Peel; and he instructed Anson to take this memorandum to\nthe ex-Minister. Lord Melbourne, lounging on a sofa, read it through\nwith compressed lips. \"This is quite an apple-pie opinion,\" he said.\nWhen Anson ventured to expostulate further, suggesting that it was\nunseemly in the leader of the Opposition to maintain an intimate\nrelationship with the Sovereign, the old man lost his temper. \"God\neternally damn it!\" he exclaimed, leaping up from his sofa, and dashing\nabout the room. \"Flesh and blood cannot stand this!\" He continued to\nwrite to the Queen, as before; and two more violent bombardments from\nthe Baron were needed before he was brought to reason. Then, gradually,\nhis letters grew less and less frequent, with fewer and fewer references\nto public concerns; at last, they were entirely innocuous. The Baron\nsmiled; Lord M. had accepted the inevitable.\nThe Whig Ministry resigned in September, 1841; but more than a year\nwas to elapse before another and an equally momentous change was\neffected--the removal of Lehzen. For, in the end, the mysterious\ngoverness was conquered. The steps are unknown by which Victoria was at\nlast led to accept her withdrawal with composure--perhaps with relief;\nbut it is clear that Albert's domestic position must have been greatly\nstrengthened by the appearance of children. The birth of the Princess\nRoyal had been followed in November, 1841, by that of the Prince of\nWales; and before very long another baby was expected. The Baroness,\nwith all her affection, could have but a remote share in such family\ndelights. She lost ground perceptibly. It was noticed as a phenomenon\nthat, once or twice, when the Court travelled, she was left behind at\nWindsor. The Prince was very cautious; at the change of Ministry, Lord\nMelbourne had advised him to choose that moment for decisive action;\nbut he judged it wiser to wait. Time and the pressure of inevitable\ncircumstances were for him; every day his predominance grew more\nassured--and every night. At length he perceived that he need hesitate\nno longer--that every wish, every velleity of his had only to be\nexpressed to be at once Victoria's. He spoke, and Lehzen vanished for\never. No more would she reign in that royal heart and those royal halls.\nNo more, watching from a window at Windsor, would she follow her pupil\nand her sovereign walking on the terrace among the obsequious multitude,\nwith the eye of triumphant love. Returning to her native Hanover she\nestablished herself at Buckeburg in a small but comfortable house, the\nwalls of which were entirely covered by portraits of Her Majesty. The\nBaron, in spite of his dyspepsia, smiled again: Albert was supreme.\nIV",

            "text": "The early discords had passed away completely--resolved into the\nabsolute harmony of married life. Victoria, overcome by a new, an\nunimagined revelation, had surrendered her whole soul to her husband.\nThe beauty and the charm which so suddenly had made her his at first\nwere, she now saw, no more than but the outward manifestation of the\ntrue Albert. There was an inward beauty, an inward glory which, blind\nthat she was, she had then but dimly apprehended, but of which now she\nwas aware in every fibre of her being--he was good--he was great! How\ncould she ever have dreamt of setting up her will against his wisdom,\nher ignorance against his knowledge, her fancies against his perfect\ntaste? Had she really once loved London and late hours and dissipation?\nShe who now was only happy in the country, she who jumped out of bed\nevery morning--oh, so early!--with Albert, to take a walk, before\nbreakfast, with Albert alone! How wonderful it was to be taught by him!\nTo be told by him which trees were which; and to learn all about the\nbees! And then to sit doing cross-stitch while he read aloud to her\nHallam's Constitutional History of England! Or to listen to him playing\non his new organ 'The organ is the first of instruments,' he said; or\nto sing to him a song by Mendelssohn, with a great deal of care over\nthe time and the breathing, and only a very occasional false note! And,\nafter dinner, to--oh, how good of him! He had given up his double chess!\nAnd so there could be round games at the round table, or everyone could\nspend the evening in the most amusing way imaginable--spinning counters\nand rings.' When the babies came it was still more wonderful. Pussy was\nsuch a clever little girl (\"I am not Pussy! I am the Princess Royal!\"\nshe had angrily exclaimed on one occasion); and Bertie--well, she could\nonly pray MOST fervently that the little Prince of Wales would grow up\nto \"resemble his angelic dearest Father in EVERY, EVERY respect, both in\nbody and mind.\" Her dear Mamma, too, had been drawn once more into the\nfamily circle, for Albert had brought about a reconciliation, and the\ndeparture of Lehzen had helped to obliterate the past. In Victoria's\neyes, life had become an idyll, and, if the essential elements of an\nidyll are happiness, love and simplicity, an idyll it was; though,\nindeed, it was of a kind that might have disconcerted Theocritus.\n\"Albert brought in dearest little Pussy,\" wrote Her Majesty in her\njournal, \"in such a smart white merino dress trimmed with blue, which\nMamma had given her, and a pretty cap, and placed her on my bed,\nseating himself next to her, and she was very dear and good. And, as my\nprecious, invaluable Albert sat there, and our little Love between us, I\nfelt quite moved with happiness and gratitude to God.\"\nThe past--the past of only three years since--when she looked back upon\nit, seemed a thing so remote and alien that she could explain it to\nherself in no other way than as some kind of delusion--an unfortunate\nmistake. Turning over an old volume of her diary, she came upon this\nsentence--\"As for 'the confidence of the Crown,' God knows! No MINISTER,\nNO FRIEND, EVER possessed it so entirely as this truly excellent Lord\nMelbourne possesses mine!\" A pang shot through her--she seized a\npen, and wrote upon the margin--\"Reading this again, I cannot forbear\nremarking what an artificial sort of happiness MINE was THEN, and what\na blessing it is I have now in my beloved Husband REAL and solid\nhappiness, which no Politics, no worldly reverses CAN change; it could\nnot have lasted long as it was then, for after all, kind and excellent\nas Lord M. is, and kind as he was to me, it was but in Society that I\nhad amusement, and I was only living on that superficial resource, which\nI THEN FANCIED was happiness! Thank God! for ME and others, this is\nchanged, and I KNOW WHAT REAL HAPPINESS IS--V. R.\" How did she know?\nWhat is the distinction between happiness that is real and happiness\nthat is felt? So a philosopher--Lord M. himself perhaps--might have\ninquired. But she was no philosopher, and Lord M. was a phantom, and\nAlbert was beside her, and that was enough.\nHappy, certainly, she was; and she wanted everyone to know it. Her\nletters to King Leopold are sprinkled thick with raptures. \"Oh! my\ndearest uncle, I am sure if you knew HOW happy, how blessed I feel, and\nhow PROUD I feel in possessing SUCH a perfect being as my husband...\"\nsuch ecstasies seemed to gush from her pen unceasingly and almost\nof their own accord. When, one day, without thinking, Lady Lyttelton\ndescribed someone to her as being \"as happy as a queen,\" and then grew\na little confused, \"Don't correct yourself, Lady Lyttelton,\" said Her\nMajesty. \"A queen IS a very happy woman.\"\nBut this new happiness was no lotus dream. On the contrary, it was\nbracing, rather than relaxing. Never before had she felt so acutely the\nnecessity for doing her duty. She worked more methodically than ever\nat the business of State; she watched over her children with untiring\nvigilance. She carried on a large correspondence; she was occupied with\nher farm--her dairy--a whole multitude of household avocations--from\nmorning till night. Her active, eager little body hurrying with quick\nsteps after the long strides of Albert down the corridors and avenues\nof Windsor, seemed the very expression of her spirit. Amid all the\nsoftness, the deliciousness of unmixed joy, all the liquescence, the\noverflowings of inexhaustible sentiment, her native rigidity remained.\n\"A vein of iron,\" said Lady Lyttelton, who, as royal governess, had good\nmeans of observation, \"runs through her most extraordinary character.\"\nSometimes the delightful routine of domestic existence had to be\ninterrupted. It was necessary to exchange Windsor for Buckingham\nPalace, to open Parliament, or to interview official personages, or,\noccasionally, to entertain foreign visitors at the Castle. Then the\nquiet Court put on a sudden magnificence, and sovereigns from over\nthe seas--Louis Philippe, or the King of Prussia, or the King of\nSaxony--found at Windsor an entertainment that was indeed a royal one.\nFew spectacles in Europe, it was agreed, produced an effect so imposing\nas the great Waterloo banqueting hall, crowded with guests in sparkling\ndiamonds and blazing uniforms, the long walls hung with the stately\nportraits of heroes, and the tables loaded with the gorgeous gold plate\nof the kings of England. But, in that wealth of splendour, the most\nimposing spectacle of all was the Queen. The little hausfrau, who had\nspent the day before walking out with her children, inspecting her\nlivestock, practicing shakes at the piano, and filling up her journal\nwith adoring descriptions of her husband, suddenly shone forth, without\nart, without effort, by a spontaneous and natural transition, the very\nculmination of Majesty. The Tsar of Russia himself was deeply impressed.\nVictoria on her side viewed with secret awe the tremendous Nicholas. \"A\ngreat event and a great compliment HIS visit certainly is,\" she told\nher uncle, \"and the people HERE are extremely flattered at it. He is\ncertainly a VERY STRIKING man; still very handsome. His profile is\nBEAUTIFUL and his manners MOST dignified and graceful; extremely\ncivil--quite alarmingly so, as he is so full of attentions and\nPOLITENESS. But the expression of the EYES is FORMIDABLE and unlike\nanything I ever saw before.\" She and Albert and \"the good King of\nSaxony,\" who happened to be there at the same time, and whom, she said,\n\"we like much--he is so unassuming-\" drew together like tame villatic\nfowl in the presence of that awful eagle. When he was gone, they\ncompared notes about his face, his unhappiness, and his despotic power\nover millions. Well! She for her part could not help pitying him, and\nshe thanked God she was Queen of England.\nWhen the time came for returning some of these visits, the royal pair\nset forth in their yacht, much to Victoria's satisfaction. \"I do love a\nship!\" she exclaimed, ran up and down ladders with the greatest agility,\nand cracked jokes with the sailors. The Prince was more aloof. They\nvisited Louis Philippe at the Chateau d'Eu; they visited King Leopold in\nBrussels. It happened that a still more remarkable Englishwoman was in\nthe Belgian capital, but she was not remarked; and Queen Victoria passed\nunknowing before the steady gaze of one of the mistresses in M. Heger's\npensionnat. \"A little stout, vivacious lady, very plainly dressed--not\nmuch dignity or pretension about her,\" was Charlotte Bronte's comment\nas the royal carriage and six flashed by her, making her wait on the\npavement for a moment, and interrupting the train of her reflections.\nVictoria was in high spirits, and even succeeded in instilling a little\ncheerfulness into her uncle's sombre Court. King Leopold, indeed, was\nperfectly contented. His dearest hopes had been fulfilled; all his\nambitions were satisfied; and for the rest of his life he had only to\nenjoy, in undisturbed decorum, his throne, his respectability, the table\nof precedence, and the punctual discharge of his irksome duties.\nBut unfortunately the felicity of those who surrounded him was less\ncomplete. His Court, it was murmured, was as gloomy as a conventicle,\nand the most dismal of all the sufferers was his wife. \"Pas de\nplaisanteries, madame!\" he had exclaimed to the unfortunate successor of\nthe Princess Charlotte, when, in the early days of their marriage, she\nhad attempted a feeble joke. Did she not understand that the consort\nof a constitutional sovereign must not be frivolous? She understood, at\nlast, only too well; and when the startled walls of the state apartments\nre-echoed to the chattering and the laughter of Victoria, the poor lady\nfound that she had almost forgotten how to smile.\nAnother year, Germany was visited, and Albert displayed the beauties of\nhis home. When Victoria crossed the frontier, she was much excited--and\nshe was astonished as well. \"To hear the people speak German,\" she noted\nin her diary, \"and to see the German soldiers, etc., seemed to me\nso singular.\" Having recovered from this slight shock, she found the\ncountry charming. She was feted everywhere, crowds of the surrounding\nroyalties swooped down to welcome her, and the prettiest groups of\npeasant children, dressed in their best clothes, presented her with\nbunches of flowers. The principality of Coburg, with its romantic\nscenery and its well-behaved inhabitants, particularly delighted her;\nand when she woke up one morning to find herself in \"dear Rosenau, my\nAlbert's birthplace,\" it was \"like a beautiful dream.\" On her return\nhome, she expatiated, in a letter to King Leopold, upon the pleasures\nof the trip, dwelling especially upon the intensity of her affection for\nAlbert's native land. \"I have a feeling,\" she said, \"for our dear little\nGermany, which I cannot describe. I felt it at Rosenau so much. It is\na something which touches me, and which goes to my heart, and makes me\ninclined to cry. I never felt at any other place that sort of pensive\npleasure and peace which I felt there. I fear I almost like it too\nmuch.\"\nV\nThe husband was not so happy as the wife. In spite of the great\nimprovement in his situation, in spite of a growing family and the\nadoration of Victoria, Albert was still a stranger in a strange land,\nand the serenity of spiritual satisfaction was denied him. It was\nsomething, no doubt, to have dominated his immediate environment; but it\nwas not enough; and, besides, in the very completeness of his success,\nthere was a bitterness. Victoria idolised him; but it was understanding\nthat he craved for, not idolatry; and how much did Victoria, filled\nto the brim though she was with him, understand him? How much does the\nbucket understand the well? He was lonely. He went to his organ and\nimprovised with learned modulations until the sounds, swelling and\nsubsiding through elaborate cadences, brought some solace to his heart.\nThen, with the elasticity of youth, he hurried off to play with the\nbabies, or to design a new pigsty, or to read aloud the \"Church History\nof Scotland\" to Victoria, or to pirouette before her on one toe, like a\nballet-dancer, with a fixed smile, to show her how she ought to behave\nwhen she appeared in public places. Thus did he amuse himself; but there\nwas one distraction in which he did not indulge. He never flirted--no,\nnot with the prettiest ladies of the Court. When, during their\nengagement, the Queen had remarked with pride to Lord Melbourne that\nthe Prince paid no attention to any other woman, the cynic had answered,\n\"No, that sort of thing is apt to come later;\" upon which she had\nscolded him severely, and then hurried off to Stockmar to repeat what\nLord M. had said. But the Baron had reassured her; though in other\ncases, he had replied, that might happen, he did not think it would\nin Albert's. And the Baron was right. Throughout their married life no\nrival female charms ever had cause to give Victoria one moment's pang of\njealousy.\nWhat more and more absorbed him--bringing with it a curious comfort of\nits own--was his work. With the advent of Peel, he began to intervene\nactively in the affairs of the State. In more ways than one--in the cast\nof their intelligence, in their moral earnestness, even in the uneasy\nformalism of their manners--the two men resembled each other; there was\na sympathy between them; and thus Peel was ready enough to listen to the\nadvice of Stockmar, and to urge the Prince forward into public life.\nA royal commission was about to be formed to enquire whether advantage\nmight not be taken of the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament to\nencourage the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom; and Peel, with great\nperspicacity, asked the Prince to preside over it. The work was of a\nkind which precisely suited Albert: his love of art, his love of method,\nhis love of coming into contact--close yet dignified--with distinguished\nmen--it satisfied them all; and he threw himself into it con amore.\nSome of the members of the commission were somewhat alarmed when, in his\nopening speech, he pointed out the necessity of dividing the subjects\nto be considered into \"categories-\" the word, they thought, smacked\ndangerously of German metaphysics; but their confidence returned when\nthey observed His Royal Highness's extraordinary technical acquaintance\nwith the processes of fresco painting. When the question arose as to\nwhether the decorations upon the walls of the new buildings should,\nor should not, have a moral purpose, the Prince spoke strongly for the\naffirmative. Although many, he observed, would give but a passing glance\nto the works, the painter was not therefore to forget that others\nmight view them with more thoughtful eyes. This argument convinced the\ncommission, and it was decided that the subjects to be depicted should\nbe of an improving nature. The frescoes were carried out in accordance\nwith the commission's instructions, but unfortunately before very long\nthey had become, even to the most thoughtful eyes, totally invisible.\nIt seems that His Royal Highness's technical acquaintance with the\nprocesses of fresco painting was incomplete!\nThe next task upon which the Prince embarked was a more arduous one:\nhe determined to reform the organisation of the royal household. This\nreform had been long overdue. For years past the confusion, discomfort,\nand extravagance in the royal residences, and in Buckingham Palace\nparticularly, had been scandalous; no reform had been practicable under\nthe rule of the Baroness; but her functions had now devolved upon\nthe Prince, and in 1844, he boldly attacked the problem. Three years\nearlier, Stockmar, after careful enquiry, had revealed in an elaborate\nmemorandum an extraordinary state of affairs. The control of the\nhousehold, it appeared, was divided in the strangest manner between a\nnumber of authorities, each independent of the other, each possessed\nof vague and fluctuating powers, without responsibility, and without\nco-ordination. Of these authorities, the most prominent were the Lord\nSteward and the Lord Chamberlain--noblemen of high rank and political\nimportance, who changed office with every administration, who did not\nreside with the Court, and had no effective representatives attached\nto it. The distribution of their respective functions was uncertain\nand peculiar. In Buckingham Palace, it was believed that the Lord\nChamberlain had charge of the whole of the rooms, with the exception of\nthe kitchen, sculleries, and pantries, which were claimed by the Lord\nSteward. At the same time, the outside of the Palace was under the\ncontrol of neither of these functionaries--but of the Office of Woods\nand Forests; and thus, while the insides of the windows were cleaned by\nthe Department of the Lord Chamberlain--or possibly, in certain cases,\nof the Lord Steward--the Office of Woods and Forests cleaned their\noutsides. Of the servants, the housekeepers, the pages, and the\nhousemaids were under the authority of the Lord Chamberlain; the clerk\nof the kitchen, the cooks, and the porters were under that of the Lord\nSteward; but the footmen, the livery-porters, and the under-butlers\ntook their orders from yet another official--the Master of the Horse.\nNaturally, in these circumstances the service was extremely defective\nand the lack of discipline among the servants disgraceful. They absented\nthemselves for as long as they pleased and whenever the fancy took\nthem; \"and if,\" as the Baron put it, \"smoking, drinking, and other\nirregularities occur in the dormitories, where footmen, etc., sleep\nten and twelve in each room, no one can help it.\" As for Her Majesty's\nguests, there was nobody to show them to their rooms, and they were\noften left, having utterly lost their way in the complicated passages,\nto wander helpless by the hour. The strange divisions of authority\nextended not only to persons but to things. The Queen observed that\nthere was never a fire in the dining-room. She enquired why. The answer\nwas \"the Lord Steward lays the fire, and the Lord Chamberlain lights\nit;\" the underlings of those two great noblemen having failed to come\nto an accommodation, there was no help for it--the Queen must eat in the\ncold.\nA surprising incident opened everyone's eyes to the confusion and\nnegligence that reigned in the Palace. A fortnight after the birth of\nthe Princess Royal the nurse heard a suspicious noise in the room next\nto the Queen's bedroom. She called to one of the pages, who, looking\nunder a large sofa, perceived there a crouching figure \"with a most\nrepulsive appearance.\" It was \"the boy Jones.\" This enigmatical\npersonage, whose escapades dominated the newspapers for several ensuing\nmonths, and whose motives and character remained to the end ambiguous,\nwas an undersized lad of 17, the son of a tailor, who had apparently\ngained admittance to the Palace by climbing over the garden wall and\nwalking in through an open window. Two years before he had paid a\nsimilar visit in the guise of a chimney-sweep. He now declared that he\nhad spent three days in the Palace, hiding under various beds, that he\nhad \"helped himself to soup and other eatables,\" and that he had \"sat\nupon the throne, seen the Queen, and heard the Princess Royal squall.\"\nEvery detail of the strange affair was eagerly canvassed. The Times\nreported that the boy Jones had \"from his infancy been fond of reading,\"\nbut that \"his countenance is exceedingly sullen.\" It added: \"The sofa\nunder which the boy Jones was discovered, we understand, is one of\nthe most costly and magnificent material and workmanship, and ordered\nexpressly for the accommodation of the royal and illustrious visitors\nwho call to pay their respects to Her Majesty.\" The culprit was sent\nfor three months to the \"House of Correction.\" When he emerged, he\nimmediately returned to Buckingham Palace. He was discovered, and sent\nback to the \"House of Correction\" for another three months, after which\nhe was offered L4 a week by a music hall to appear upon the stage.\nHe refused this offer, and shortly afterwards was found by the police\nloitering round Buckingham Palace. The authorities acted vigorously,\nand, without any trial or process of law, shipped the boy Jones off to\nsea. A year later his ship put into Portsmouth to refit, and he at once\ndisembarked and walked to London. He was re-arrested before he reached\nthe Palace, and sent back to his ship, the Warspite. On this occasion it\nwas noticed that he had \"much improved in personal appearance and grown\nquite corpulent;\" and so the boy Jones passed out of history, though\nwe catch one last glimpse of him in 1844 falling overboard in the\nnight between Tunis and Algiers. He was fished up again; but it was\nconjectured--as one of the Warspite's officers explained in a letter\nto The Times--that his fall had not been accidental, but that he\nhad deliberately jumped into the Mediterranean in order to \"see the\nlife-buoy light burning.\" Of a boy with such a record, what else could\nbe supposed?\nBut discomfort and alarm were not the only results of the mismanagement\nof the household; the waste, extravagance, and peculation that also\nflowed from it were immeasurable. There were preposterous perquisites\nand malpractices of every kind. It was, for instance, an ancient and\nimmutable rule that a candle that had once been lighted should never be\nlighted again; what happened to the old candles, nobody knew. Again, the\nPrince, examining the accounts, was puzzled by a weekly expenditure of\nthirty-five shillings on \"Red Room Wine.\" He enquired into the matter,\nand after great difficulty discovered that in the time of George III\na room in Windsor Castle with red hangings had once been used as a\nguard-room, and that five shillings a day had been allowed to provide\nwine for the officers. The guard had long since been moved elsewhere,\nbut the payment for wine in the Red Room continued, the money being\nreceived by a half-pay officer who held the sinecure position of\nunder-butler.\nAfter much laborious investigation, and a stiff struggle with the\nmultitude of vested interests which had been brought into being by long\nyears of neglect, the Prince succeeded in effecting a complete reform.\nThe various conflicting authorities were induced to resign their powers\ninto the hands of a single official, the Master of the Household, who\nbecame responsible for the entire management of the royal palaces. Great\neconomies were made, and the whole crowd of venerable abuses was swept\naway. Among others, the unlucky half-pay officer of the Red Room was,\nmuch to his surprise, given the choice of relinquishing his weekly\nemolument or of performing the duties of an under-butler. Even the\nirregularities among the footmen, etc., were greatly diminished. There\nwere outcries and complaints; the Prince was accused of meddling, of\ninjustice, and of saving candle-ends; but he held on his course, and\nbefore long the admirable administration of the royal household was\nrecognised as a convincing proof of his perseverance and capacity.\nAt the same time his activity was increasing enormously in a more\nimportant sphere. He had become the Queen's Private Secretary, her\nconfidential adviser, her second self. He was now always present at her\ninterviews with Ministers. He took, like the Queen, a special interest\nin foreign policy; but there was no public question in which his\ninfluence was not felt. A double process was at work; while Victoria\nfell more and more absolutely under his intellectual predominance, he,\nsimultaneously, grew more and more completely absorbed by the machinery\nof high politics--the incessant and multifarious business of a great\nState. Nobody any more could call him a dilettante; he was a worker,\na public personage, a man of affairs. Stockmar noted the change with\nexultation. \"The Prince,\" he wrote, \"has improved very much lately.\nHe has evidently a head for politics. He has become, too, far more\nindependent. His mental activity is constantly on the increase, and he\ngives the greater part of his time to business, without complaining.\"\n\"The relations between husband and wife,\" added the Baron, \"are all one\ncould desire.\"\nLong before Peel's ministry came to an end, there had been a complete\nchange in Victoria's attitude towards him. His appreciation of the\nPrince had softened her heart; the sincerity and warmth of his nature,\nwhich, in private intercourse with those whom he wished to please, had\nthe power of gradually dissipating the awkwardness of his manners,\ndid the rest. She came in time to regard him with intense feelings of\nrespect and attachment. She spoke of \"our worthy Peel,\" for whom, she\nsaid, she had \"an EXTREME admiration\" and who had shown himself \"a man\nof unbounded LOYALTY, COURAGE patriotism, and HIGH-MINDEDNESS, and his\nconduct towards me has been CHIVALROUS almost, I might say.\" She dreaded\nhis removal from office almost as frantically as she had once dreaded\nthat of Lord M. It would be, she declared, a GREAT CALAMITY. Six years\nbefore, what would she have said, if a prophet had told her that the day\nwould come when she would be horrified by the triumph of the Whigs? Yet\nthere was no escaping it; she had to face the return of her old\nfriends. In the ministerial crises of 1845 and 1846, the Prince played a\ndominating part. Everybody recognised that he was the real centre of the\nnegotiations--the actual controller of the forces and the functions\nof the Crown. The process by which this result was reached had been so\ngradual as to be almost imperceptible; but it may be said with certainty\nthat, by the close of Peel's administration, Albert had become, in\neffect, the King of England.\nVI\nWith the final emergence of the Prince came the final extinction of Lord\nMelbourne. A year after his loss of office, he had been struck down by\na paralytic seizure; he had apparently recovered, but his old elasticity\nhad gone for ever. Moody, restless, and unhappy, he wandered like a\nghost about the town, bursting into soliloquies in public places, or\nasking odd questions, suddenly, a propos de bottes. \"I'll be hanged if\nI do it for you, my Lord,\" he was heard to say in the hall at Brooks's,\nstanding by himself, and addressing the air after much thought. \"Don't\nyou consider,\" he abruptly asked a fellow-guest at Lady Holland's,\nleaning across the dinner-table in a pause of the conversation, \"that\nit was a most damnable act of Henri Quatre to change his religion with\na view to securing the Crown?\" He sat at home, brooding for hours in\nmiserable solitude. He turned over his books--his classics and his\nTestaments--but they brought him no comfort at all. He longed for the\nreturn of the past, for the impossible, for he knew not what, for the\ndevilries of Caro, for the happy platitudes of Windsor. His friends had\nleft him, and no wonder, he said in bitterness--the fire was out. He\nsecretly hoped for a return to power, scanning the newspapers with\nsolicitude, and occasionally making a speech in the House of Lords. His\ncorrespondence with the Queen continued, and he appeared from time to\ntime at Court; but he was a mere simulacrum of his former self; \"the\ndream,\" wrote Victoria, \"is past.\" As for his political views, they\ncould no longer be tolerated. The Prince was an ardent Free Trader, and\nso, of course, was the Queen; and when, dining at Windsor at the time of\nthe repeal of the Corn Laws, Lord Melbourne suddenly exclaimed, \"Ma'am,\nit's a damned dishonest act!\" everyone was extremely embarrassed. Her\nMajesty laughed and tried to change the conversation, but without avail;\nLord Melbourne returned to the charge again and again with--\"I say,\nMa'am, it's damned dishonest!\"--until the Queen said \"Lord Melbourne, I\nmust beg you not to say anything more on this subject now;\" and then\nhe held his tongue. She was kind to him, writing him long letters, and\nalways remembering his birthday; but it was kindness at a distance, and\nhe knew it. He had become \"poor Lord Melbourne.\" A profound disquietude\ndevoured him. He tried to fix his mind on the condition of Agriculture\nand the Oxford Movement. He wrote long memoranda in utterly\nundecipherable handwriting. He was convinced that he had lost all his\nmoney, and could not possibly afford to be a Knight of the Garter. He\nhad run through everything, and yet--if Peel went out, he might be sent\nfor--why not? He was never sent for. The Whigs ignored him in their\nconsultations, and the leadership of the party passed to Lord\nJohn Russell. When Lord John became Prime Minister, there was much\npoliteness, but Lord Melbourne was not asked to join the Cabinet. He\nbore the blow with perfect amenity; but he understood, at last, that\nthat was the end.\nFor two years more he lingered, sinking slowly into unconsciousness and\nimbecility. Sometimes, propped up in his chair, he would be heard to\nmurmur, with unexpected appositeness, the words of Samson:--\n\"So much I feel my general spirit droop,\nMy hopes all flat, nature within me seems,\nIn all her functions weary of herself,\nMy race of glory run, and race of shame,\nAnd I shall shortly be with them that rest.\"\nA few days before his death, Victoria, learning that there was no hope\nof his recovery, turned her mind for a little towards that which had\nonce been Lord M. \"You will grieve to hear,\" she told King Leopold,\n\"that our good, dear, old friend Melbourne is dying... One cannot\nforget how good and kind and amiable he was, and it brings back so many\nrecollections to my mind, though, God knows! I never wish that time back\nagain.\"\nShe was in little danger. The tide of circumstance was flowing now\nwith irresistible fullness towards a very different consummation.\nThe seriousness of Albert, the claims of her children, her own inmost\ninclinations, and the movement of the whole surrounding world, combined\nto urge her forward along the narrow way of public and domestic duty.\nHer family steadily increased. Within eighteen months of the birth of\nthe Prince of Wales the Princess Alice appeared, and a year later the\nPrince Alfred, and then the Princess Helena, and, two years afterwards,\nthe Princess Louise; and still there were signs that the pretty row of\nroyal infants was not complete. The parents, more and more involved in\nfamily cares and family happiness, found the pomp of Windsor galling,\nand longed for some more intimate and remote retreat. On the advice of\nPeel they purchased the estate of Osborne, in the Isle of Wight. Their\nskill and economy in financial matters had enabled them to lay aside a\nsubstantial sum of money; and they could afford, out of their savings,\nnot merely to buy the property but to build a new house for themselves\nand to furnish it at a cost of L200,000. At Osborne, by the sea-shore,\nand among the woods, which Albert, with memories of Rosenau in his mind,\nhad so carefully planted, the royal family spent every hour that could\nbe snatched from Windsor and London--delightful hours of deep retirement\nand peaceful work. The public looked on with approval. A few aristocrats\nmight sniff or titter; but with the nation at large the Queen was now\nonce more extremely popular. The middle-classes, in particular, were\npleased. They liked a love-match; they liked a household which combined\nthe advantages of royalty and virtue, and in which they seemed to see,\nreflected as in some resplendent looking-glass, the ideal image of the\nvery lives they led themselves. Their own existences, less exalted,\nbut oh! so soothingly similar, acquired an added excellence, an added\nsucculence, from the early hours, the regularity, the plain tuckers, the\nround games, the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding oft Osborne. It was\nindeed a model Court. Not only were its central personages the patterns\nof propriety, but no breath of scandal, no shadow of indecorum, might\napproach its utmost boundaries. For Victoria, with all the zeal of a\nconvert, upheld now the standard of moral purity with an inflexibility\nsurpassing, if that were possible, Albert's own. She blushed to think\nhow she had once believed--how she had once actually told HIM--that one\nmight be too strict and particular in such matters, and that one ought\nto be indulgent towards other people's dreadful sins. But she was\nno longer Lord M's pupil: she was Albert's wife. She was more--the\nembodiment, the living apex of a new era in the generations of mankind.\nThe last vestige of the eighteenth century had disappeared; cynicism and\nsubtlety were shrivelled into powder; and duty, industry, morality, and\ndomesticity triumphed over them. Even the very chairs and tables had\nassumed, with a singular responsiveness, the forms of prim solidity. The\nVictorian Age was in full swing.\nVII\nOnly one thing more was needed: material expression must be given to\nthe new ideals and the new forces so that they might stand revealed, in\nvisible glory, before the eyes of an astonished world. It was for Albert\nto supply this want. He mused, and was inspired: the Great Exhibition\ncame into his head.\nWithout consulting anyone, he thought out the details of his conception\nwith the minutest care. There had been exhibitions before in the world,\nbut this should surpass them all. It should contain specimens of\nwhat every country could produce in raw materials, in machinery and\nmechanical inventions, in manufactures, and in the applied and plastic\narts. It should not be merely useful and ornamental; it should teach\na high moral lesson. It should be an international monument to those\nsupreme blessings of civilisation--peace, progress, and prosperity. For\nsome time past the Prince had been devoting much of his attention to the\nproblems of commerce and industry. He had a taste for machinery of every\nkind, and his sharp eye had more than once detected, with the precision\nof an expert, a missing cog-wheel in some vast and complicated engine. A\nvisit to Liverpool, where he opened the Albert Dock, impressed upon his\nmind the immensity of modern industrial forces, though in a letter\nto Victoria describing his experiences, he was careful to retain his\ncustomary lightness of touch. \"As I write,\" he playfully remarked,\n\"you will be making your evening toilette, and not be ready in time for\ndinner. I must set about the same task, and not, let me hope, with the\nsame result... The loyalty and enthusiasm of the inhabitants are great;\nbut the heat is greater still. I am satisfied that if the population of\nLiverpool had been weighed this morning, and were to be weighed again\nnow, they would be found many degrees lighter. The docks are wonderful,\nand the mass of shipping incredible.\" In art and science he had been\ndeeply interested since boyhood; his reform of the household had put\nhis talent for organisation beyond a doubt; and thus from every point\nof view the Prince was well qualified for his task. Having matured his\nplans, he summoned a small committee and laid an outline of his scheme\nbefore it. The committee approved, and the great undertaking was set on\nfoot without delay.\nTwo years, however, passed before it was completed. For two years the\nPrince laboured with extraordinary and incessant energy. At first all\nwent smoothly. The leading manufacturers warmly took up the idea; the\ncolonies and the East India Company were sympathetic; the great foreign\nnations were eager to send in their contributions; the powerful support\nof Sir Robert Peel was obtained, and the use of a site in Hyde Park,\nselected by the Prince, was sanctioned by the Government. Out of 234\nplans for the exhibition building, the Prince chose that of Joseph\nPaxton, famous as a designer of gigantic conservatories; and the work\nwas on the point of being put in hand when a series of unexpected\ndifficulties arose. Opposition to the whole scheme, which had long been\nsmouldering in various quarters, suddenly burst forth. There was\nan outcry, headed by The Times, against the use of the park for the\nexhibition; for a moment it seemed as if the building would be relegated\nto a suburb; but, after a fierce debate in the House, the supporters\nof the site in the Park won the day. Then it appeared that the project\nlacked a sufficient financial backing; but this obstacle, too, was\nsurmounted, and eventually L200,000 was subscribed as a guarantee fund.\nThe enormous glass edifice rose higher and higher, covering acres and\nenclosing towering elm trees beneath its roof: and then the fury of\nits enemies reached a climax. The fashionable, the cautious, the\nProtectionists, the pious, all joined in the hue and cry. It was pointed\nout that the Exhibition would serve as a rallying point for all the\nruffians in England, for all the malcontents in Europe; and that on\nthe day of its opening there would certainly be a riot and probably a\nrevolution. It was asserted that the glass roof was porous, and that the\ndroppings of fifty million sparrows would utterly destroy every object\nbeneath it. Agitated nonconformists declared that the Exhibition was an\narrogant and wicked enterprise which would infallibly bring down God's\npunishment upon the nation. Colonel Sibthorpe, in the debate on the\nAddress, prayed that hail and lightning might descend from heaven on the\naccursed thing. The Prince, with unyielding perseverance and infinite\npatience, pressed on to his goal. His health was seriously affected; he\nsuffered from constant sleeplessness; his strength was almost worn out.\nBut he remembered the injunctions of Stockmar and never relaxed. The\nvolume of his labours grew more prodigious every day; he toiled at\ncommittees, presided over public meetings, made speeches, and carried on\ncommunications with every corner of the civilised world--and his efforts\nwere rewarded. On May 1, 1851, the Great Exhibition was opened by the\nQueen before an enormous concourse of persons, amid scenes of dazzling\nbrilliancy and triumphant enthusiasm.\nVictoria herself was in a state of excitement which bordered on\ndelirium. She performed her duties in a trance of joy, gratitude, and\namazement, and, when it was all over, her feelings poured themselves out\ninto her journal in a torrential flood. The day had been nothing but\nan endless succession of glories--or rather one vast glory--one vast\nradiation of Albert. Everything she had seen, everything she had felt\nor heard, had been so beautiful, so wonderful that even the royal\nunderlinings broke down under the burden of emphasis, while her\nremembering pen rushed on, regardless, from splendour to splendour--the\nhuge crowds, so well--behaved and loyal-flags of all the nations\nfloating--the inside of the building, so immense, with myriads of people\nand the sun shining through the roof--a little side room, where we left\nour shawls--palm-trees and machinery--dear Albert--the place so big\nthat we could hardly hear the organ--thankfulness to God--a curious\nassemblage of political and distinguished men--the March from\nAthalie--God bless my dearest Albert, God bless my dearest country!--a\nglass fountain--the Duke and Lord Anglesey walking arm in arm--a\nbeautiful Amazon, in bronze, by Kiss--Mr. Paxton, who might be justly\nproud, and rose from being a common gardener's boy--Sir George Grey in\ntears, and everybody astonished and delighted.\nA striking incident occurred when, after a short prayer by the\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the choir of 600 voices burst into the\n\"Hallelujah Chorus.\" At that moment a Chinaman, dressed in full national\ncostume, stepped out into the middle of the central nave, and, advancing\nslowly towards the royal group, did obeisance to Her Majesty. The Queen,\nmuch impressed, had no doubt that he was an eminent mandarin; and,\nwhen the final procession was formed, orders were given that, as\nno representative of the Celestial Empire was present, he should be\nincluded in the diplomatic cortege. He accordingly, with the utmost\ngravity, followed immediately behind the Ambassadors. He subsequently\ndisappeared, and it was rumoured, among ill-natured people, that, far\nfrom being a mandarin, the fellow was a mere impostor. But nobody ever\nreally discovered the nature of the comments that had been lurking\nbehind the matchless impassivity of that yellow face.\nA few days later Victoria poured out her heart to her uncle. The\nfirst of May, she said, was \"the GREATEST day in our history, the most\nBEAUTIFUL and IMPOSING and TOUCHING spectacle ever seen, and the triumph\nof my beloved Albert... It was the HAPPIEST, PROUDEST day in my life,\nand I can think of nothing else. Albert's dearest name is immortalised\nwith this GREAT conception, HIS own, and my OWN dear country SHOWED she\nwas WORTHY of it. The triumph is IMMENSE.\"\nIt was. The enthusiasm was universal; even the bitterest scoffers were\nconverted, and joined in the chorus of praise. Congratulations from\npublic bodies poured in; the City of Paris gave a great fete to the\nExhibition committee; and the Queen and the Prince made a triumphal\nprogress through the North of England. The financial results were\nequally remarkable. The total profit made by the Exhibition amounted to\na sum of L165,000, which was employed in the purchase of land for the\nerection of a permanent National Museum in South Kensington. During\nthe six months of its existence in Hyde Park over six million persons\nvisited it, and not a single accident occurred. But there is an end to\nall things; and the time had come for the Crystal Palace to be removed\nto the salubrious seclusion of Sydenham. Victoria, sad but resigned,\npaid her final visit. \"It looked so beautiful,\" she said. \"I could not\nbelieve it was the last time I was to see it. An organ, accompanied by\na fine and powerful wind instrument called the sommerophone, was being\nplayed, and it nearly upset me. The canvas is very dirty, the red\ncurtains are faded and many things are very much soiled, still the\neffect is fresh and new as ever and most beautiful. The glass fountain\nwas already removed... and the sappers and miners were rolling about\nthe little boxes just as they did at the beginning. It made us all very\nmelancholy.\" But more cheerful thoughts followed. When all was over,\nshe expressed her boundless satisfaction in a dithyrambic letter to\nthe Prime Minister. Her beloved husband's name, she said, was for ever\nimmortalised, and that this was universally recognised by the country\nwas a source to her of immense happiness and gratitude. \"She feels\ngrateful to Providence,\" Her Majesty concluded, \"to have permitted her\nto be united to so great, so noble, so excellent a Prince, and this year\nwill ever remain the proudest and happiest of her life. The day of the\nclosing of the Exhibition (which the Queen regretted much she could not\nwitness), was the twelfth anniversary of her betrothal to the Prince,\nwhich is a curious coincidence.\"",

When Lord Grey came into power he received the Foreign\nSecretaryship, a post which he continued to occupy, with two intervals,\nfor another twenty-one years. Throughout this period his reputation\nwith the public had steadily grown, and when, in 1846, he became Foreign\nSecretary for the third time, his position in the country was almost,\nif not quite, on an equality with that of the Prime Minister, Lord John\nRussell. He was a tall, big man of sixty-two, with a jaunty air, a large\nface, dyed whiskers, and a long sardonic upper lip. His private life was\nfar from respectable, but he had greatly strengthened his position\nin society by marrying, late in life, Lady Cowper, the sister of Lord\nMelbourne, and one of the most influential of the Whig hostesses.\nPowerful, experienced, and supremely self-confident, he naturally\npaid very little attention to Albert. Why should he? The Prince was\ninterested in foreign affairs? Very well, then; let the Prince pay\nattention to him--to him, who had been a Cabinet Minister when Albert\nwas in the cradle, who was the chosen leader of a great nation, and who\nhad never failed in anything he had undertaken in the whole course of\nhis life. Not that he wanted the Prince's attention--far from it: so far\nas he could see, Albert was merely a young foreigner, who suffered from\nhaving no vices, and whose only claim to distinction was that he had\nhappened to marry the Queen of England. This estimate, as he found out\nto his cost, was a mistaken one. Albert was by no means insignificant,\nand, behind Albert, there was another figure by no means insignificant\neither--there was Stockmar.",

            "text": "The first diplomatic crisis which arose after his return to office,\nthough the Prince and the Queen were closely concerned with it, passed\noff without serious disagreement between the Court and the Minister. For\nsome years past a curious problem had been perplexing the chanceries\nof Europe. Spain, ever since the time of Napoleon a prey to civil\nconvulsions, had settled down for a short interval to a state of\ncomparative quiet under the rule of Christina, the Queen Mother, and her\ndaughter Isabella, the young Queen. In 1846, the question of\nIsabella's marriage, which had for long been the subject of diplomatic\nspeculations, suddenly became acute. Various candidates for her hand\nwere proposed--among others, two cousins of her own, another Spanish\nprince, and Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, a first cousin of Victoria's\nand Albert's; for different reasons, however, none of these young men\nseemed altogether satisfactory. Isabella was not yet sixteen; and it\nmight have been supposed that her marriage could be put off for a few\nyears more; but this was considered to be out of the question. \"Vous\nne savez pas,\" said a high authority, \"ce que c'est que ces princesses\nespagnoles; elles ont le diable au corps, et on a toujours dit que si\nnous ne nous hations pas, l'heritier viendrait avant le mari.\" It might\nalso have been supposed that the young Queen's marriage was a matter to\nbe settled by herself, her mother, and the Spanish Government; but\nthis again was far from being the case. It had become, by one of those\nperiodical reversions to the ways of the eighteenth century, which,\nit is rumoured, are still not unknown in diplomacy, a question of\ndominating importance in the foreign policies both of France and\nEngland. For several years, Louis Philippe and his Prime Minister Guizot\nhad been privately maturing a very subtle plan. It was the object of the\nFrench King to repeat the glorious coup of Louis XIV, and to abolish\nthe Pyrenees by placing one of his grandsons on the throne of Spain.\nIn order to bring this about, he did not venture to suggest that his\nyounger son, the Duc de Montpensier, should marry Isabella; that would\nhave been too obvious a move, which would have raised immediate and\ninsurmountable opposition. He therefore proposed that Isabella\nshould marry her cousin, the Duke of Cadiz, while Montpensier married\nIsabella's younger sister, the Infanta Fernanda; and pray, what possible\nobjection could there be to that? The wily old King whispered into\nthe chaste ears of Guizot the key to the secret; he had good reason to\nbelieve that the Duke of Cadiz was incapable of having children, and\ntherefore the offspring of Fernanda would inherit the Spanish crown.\nGuizot rubbed his hands, and began at once to set the necessary springs\nin motion; but, of course, the whole scheme was very soon divulged and\nunderstood. The English Government took an extremely serious view of\nthe matter; the balance of power was clearly at stake, and the French\nintrigue must be frustrated at all hazards. A diplomatic struggle of\ngreat intensity followed; and it occasionally appeared that a second War\nof the Spanish Succession was about to break out. This was avoided,\nbut the consequences of this strange imbroglio were far-reaching and\ncompletely different from what any of the parties concerned could have",

The ruin which had fallen upon the\nHouse of Coburg during the Napoleonic wars had apparently only served\nto multiply its vitality, for that princely family had by now extended\nitself over Europe in an extraordinary manner. King Leopold was firmly\nfixed in Belgium; his niece was Queen of England; one of his nephews\nwas the husband of the Queen of England, and another the husband of the\nQueen of Portugal; yet another was Duke of Wurtemberg. Where was this\nto end? There seemed to be a Coburg Trust ready to send out one of\nits members at any moment to fill up any vacant place among the ruling\nfamilies of Europe. And even beyond Europe there were signs of this\ninfection spreading. An American who had arrived in Brussels had assured\nKing Leopold that there was a strong feeling in the United States in\nfavour of monarchy instead of the misrule of mobs, and had suggested, to\nthe delight of His Majesty, that some branch of the Coburg family might\nbe available for the position. That danger might, perhaps, be remote;\nbut the Spanish danger was close at hand; and if Prince Leopold were to\nmarry Queen Isabella the position of France would be one of humiliation,\nif not of positive danger. Such were the asseverations of Louis\nPhilippe. The English Government had no wish to support Prince Leopold,\nand though Albert and Victoria had some hankerings for the match, the\nwisdom of Stockmar had induced them to give up all thoughts of it.

Five months before, the prescient Baron had\ndrawn up, in case of emergency, a memorandum, which had been carefully\ndocketed, and placed in a pigeon-hole ready to hand. The emergency had\nnow arisen, and the memorandum must be used. The Queen copied out the\nwords of Stockmar, and sent them to the Prime Minister, requesting him\nto show her letter to Palmerston. \"She thinks it right,\" she wrote, \"in\norder TO PREVENT ANY MISTAKE for the FUTURE, shortly to explain WHAT\nIT IS SHE EXPECTS FROM HER FOREIGN SECRETARY. She requires: (1) That he\nwill distinctly state what he proposes in a given case, in order\nthat the Queen may know as distinctly to WHAT she has given her Royal\nsanction; (2) Having ONCE GIVEN her sanction to a measure, that it be\nnot arbitrarily altered or modified by the Minister; such an act she\nmust consider as failing in sincerity towards the Crown, and justly to\nbe visited by the exercise of her Constitutional right of dismissing\nthat Minister.\" Lord John Russell did as he was bid, and forwarded the\nQueen's letter to Lord Palmerston. This transaction, which was of grave\nconstitutional significance, was entirely unknown to the outside world.\nIf Palmerston had been a sensitive man, he would probably have resigned\non the receipt of the Queen's missive. But he was far from sensitive; he\nloved power, and his power was greater than ever; an unerring instinct\ntold him that this was not the time to go. Nevertheless, he was\nseriously perturbed. He understood at last that he was struggling with\na formidable adversary, whose skill and strength, unless they were\nmollified, might do irreparable injury to his career. He therefore wrote\nto Lord John, briefly acquiescing in the Queen's requirements--\"I have\ntaken a copy of this memorandum of the Queen and will not fail to attend\nto the directions which it contains\"--and at the same time, he asked for\nan interview with the Prince. Albert at once summoned him to the Palace,\nand was astonished to observe, as he noted in a memorandum, that when\nPalmerston entered the room \"he was very much agitated, shook, and\nhad tears in his eyes, so as quite to move me, who never under any\ncircumstances had known him otherwise than with a bland smile on his\nface.\" The old statesman was profuse in protestations and excuses; the\nyoung one was coldly polite. At last, after a long and inconclusive\nconversation, the Prince, drawing himself up, said that, in order to\ngive Lord Palmerston \"an example of what the Queen wanted,\" he would\n\"ask him a question point-blank.\" Lord Palmerston waited in respectful\nsilence, while the Prince proceeded as follows: \"You are aware that the\nQueen has objected to the Protocol about Schleswig, and of the grounds\non which she has done so. Her opinion has been overruled, the Protocol\nstating the desire of the Great Powers to see the integrity of the\nDanish monarchy preserved has been signed, and upon this the King of\nDenmark has invaded Schleswig, where the war is raging. If Holstein is\nattacked also, which is likely, the Germans will not be restrained from\nflying to her assistance; Russia has menaced to interfere with arms,\nif the Schleswigers are successful. What will you do, if this emergency\narises (provoking most likely an European war), and which will arise\nvery probably when we shall be at Balmoral and Lord John in another\npart of Scotland? The Queen expects from your foresight that you have\ncontemplated this possibility, and requires a categorical answer as\nto what you would do in the event supposed.\" Strangely enough, to this\npointblank question, the Foreign Secretary appeared to be unable to\nreply. The whole matter, he said, was extremely complicated, and the\ncontingencies mentioned by His Royal Highness were very unlikely to\narise. The Prince persisted; but it was useless; for a full hour he\nstruggled to extract a categorical answer, until at length Palmerston\nbowed himself out of the room. Albert threw up his hands in shocked\namazement: what could one do with such a man?\nWhat indeed? For, in spite of all his apologies and all his promises,\nwithin a few weeks the incorrigible reprobate was at his tricks again.\nThe Austrian General Haynau, notorious as a rigorous suppressor of\nrebellion in Hungary and Italy, and in particular as a flogger of women,\ncame to England and took it into his head to pay a visit to Messrs.\nBarclay and Perkins's brewery. The features of \"General Hyena,\" as he\nwas everywhere called--his grim thin face, his enormous pepper-and-salt\nmoustaches--had gained a horrid celebrity; and it so happened that among\nthe clerks at the brewery there was a refugee from Vienna, who had\ngiven his fellow-workers a first-hand account of the General's\ncharacteristics. The Austrian Ambassador, scenting danger, begged his\nfriend not to appear in public, or, if he must do so, to cut off his\nmoustaches first. But the General would take no advice. He went to the\nbrewery, was immediately recognised, surrounded by a crowd of angry\ndraymen, pushed about, shouted at, punched in the ribs, and pulled by\nthe moustaches until, bolting down an alley with the mob at his heels\nbrandishing brooms and roaring \"Hyena!\" he managed to take refuge in\na public house, whence he was removed under the protection of several\npolicemen. The Austrian Government was angry and demanded explanations.\nPalmerston, who, of course, was privately delighted by the incident,\nreplied regretting what had occurred, but adding that in his opinion\nthe General had \"evinced a want of propriety in coming to England at\nthe present moment;\" and he delivered his note to the Ambassador without\nhaving previously submitted it to the Queen or to the Prime Minister.\nNaturally, when this was discovered, there was a serious storm. The\nPrince was especially indignant; the conduct of the draymen he regarded,\nwith disgust and alarm, as \"a slight foretaste of what an unregulated\nmass of illiterate people is capable;\" and Palmerston was requested by\nLord John to withdraw his note, and to substitute for it another from\nwhich all censure of the General had been omitted. On this the Foreign\nSecretary threatened resignation, but the Prime Minister was firm. For a\nmoment the royal hopes rose high, only to be dashed to the ground again\nby the cruel compliance of the enemy. Palmerston, suddenly lamblike,\nagreed to everything; the note was withdrawn and altered, and peace was\npatched up once more.\nIt lasted for a year, and then, in October, 1851, the arrival of Kossuth\nin England brought on another crisis. Palmerston's desire to receive the\nHungarian patriot at his house in London was vetoed by Lord John; once\nmore there was a sharp struggle; once more Palmerston, after threatening\nresignation, yielded. But still the insubordinate man could not keep\nquiet. A few weeks later a deputation of Radicals from Finsbury and\nIslington waited on him at the Foreign Office and presented him with an\naddress, in which the Emperors of Austria and Russia were stigmatised as\n\"odious and detestable assassins\" and \"merciless tyrants and despots.\"\nThe Foreign Secretary in his reply, while mildly deprecating these\nexpressions, allowed his real sentiments to appear with a most\nundiplomatic insouciance There was an immediate scandal, and the Court\nflowed over with rage and vituperation. \"I think,\" said the Baron, \"the\nman has been for some time insane.\" Victoria, in an agitated letter,\nurged Lord John to assert his authority. But Lord John perceived that on\nthis matter the Foreign Secretary had the support of public opinion, and\nhe judged it wiser to bide his time.\nHe had not long to wait. The culmination of the long series of\nconflicts, threats, and exacerbations came before the year was out. On\nDecember 2, Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat took place in Paris; and on\nthe following day Palmerston, without consulting anybody, expressed in a\nconversation with the French Ambassador his approval of Napoleon's act.\nTwo days later, he was instructed by the Prime Minister, in accordance\nwith a letter from the Queen, that it was the policy of the English\nGovernment to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality towards the\naffairs of France. Nevertheless, in an official despatch to the British\nAmbassador in Paris, he repeated the approval of the coup d'etat which\nhe had already given verbally to the French Ambassador in London. This\ndespatch was submitted neither to the Queen nor to the Prime Minister.\nLord John's patience, as he himself said, \"was drained to the last\ndrop.\" He dismissed Lord Palmerston.\nVictoria was in ecstasies; and Albert knew that the triumph was his even",

The day,\nthus begun, continued in unremitting industry. At breakfast, the\nnewspapers--the once hated newspapers--made their appearance, and the\nPrince, absorbed in their perusal, would answer no questions, or, if\nan article struck him, would read it aloud.

Feodora, now the Princess Hohenlohe,\nafter a visit to England, expressed in a letter to Victoria her\nadmiration of Albert both as a private and a public character. Nor did\nshe rely only on her own opinion. \"I must just copy out,\" she said,\n\"what Mr. Klumpp wrote to me some little time ago, and which is\nquite true--'Prince Albert is one of the few Royal personages who can\nsacrifice to any principle (as soon as it has become evident to them to\nbe good and noble) all those notions (or sentiments) to which others,\nowing to their narrow-mindedness, or to the prejudices of their rank,\nare so thoroughly inclined strongly to cling.' There is something so\ntruly religious in this,\" the Princess added, \"as well as humane and\njust, most soothing to my feelings which are so often hurt and disturbed\nby what I hear and see.\"\nVictoria, from the depth of her heart, subscribed to all the eulogies of\nFeodora and Mr. Klumpp. She only found that they were insufficient. As\nshe watched her beloved Albert, after toiling with state documents and\npublic functions, devoting every spare moment of his time to domestic\nduties, to artistic appreciation, and to intellectual improvements; as\nshe listened to him cracking his jokes at the luncheon table, or playing\nMendelssohn on the organ, or pointing out the merits of Sir Edwin\nLandseer's pictures; as she followed him round while he gave\ninstructions about the breeding of cattle, or decided that the\nGainsboroughs must be hung higher up so that the Winterhalters might be\nproperly seen--she felt perfectly certain that no other wife had ever\nhad such a husband. His mind was apparently capable of everything,\nand she was hardly surprised to learn that he had made an important\ndiscovery for the conversion of sewage into agricultural manure.\nFiltration from below upwards, he explained, through some appropriate\nmedium, which retained the solids and set free the fluid sewage for\nirrigation, was the principle of the scheme. \"All previous plans,\"\nhe said, \"would have cost millions; mine costs next to nothing.\"\nUnfortunately, owing to a slight miscalculation, the invention proved\nto be impracticable; but Albert's intelligence was unrebuffed, and he\npassed on, to plunge with all his accustomed ardour into a prolonged\nstudy of the rudiments of lithography.",

            "text": "But naturally it was upon his children that his private interests and\nthose of Victoria were concentrated most vigorously. The royal nurseries\nshowed no sign of emptying. The birth of the Prince Arthur in 1850 was\nfollowed, three years later, by that of the Prince Leopold; and in\n1857 the Princess Beatrice was born. A family of nine must be, in any\ncircumstances, a grave responsibility; and the Prince realised to the\nfull how much the high destinies of his offspring intensified the need\nof parental care. It was inevitable that he should believe profoundly\nin the importance of education; he himself had been the product of\neducation; Stockmar had made him what he was; it was for him, in his\nturn, to be a Stockmar--to be even more than a Stockmar--to the young\ncreatures he had brought into the world. Victoria would assist him; a\nStockmar, no doubt, she could hardly be; but she could be perpetually\nvigilant, she could mingle strictness with her affection, and she could\nalways set a good example. These considerations, of course, applied\npre-eminently to the education of the Prince of Wales. How tremendous\nwas the significance of every particle of influence which went to the\nmaking of the future King of England! Albert set to work with a will.\nBut, watching with Victoria the minutest details of the physical,\nintellectual, and moral training of his children, he soon perceived, to\nhis distress, that there was something unsatisfactory in the development\nof his eldest son. The Princess Royal was an extremely intelligent\nchild; but Bertie, though he was good-humoured and gentle, seemed to\ndisplay a deep-seated repugnance to every form of mental exertion. This\nwas most regrettable, but the remedy was obvious: the parental efforts\nmust be redoubled; instruction must be multiplied; not for a single\ninstant must the educational pressure be allowed to relax. Accordingly,\nmore tutors were selected, the curriculum was revised, the time-table of\nstudies was rearranged, elaborate memoranda dealing with every possible\ncontingency were drawn up. It was above all essential that there should\nbe no slackness: \"Work,\" said the Prince, \"must be work.\" And work\nindeed it was. The boy grew up amid a ceaseless round of paradigms,\nsyntactical exercises, dates, genealogical tables, and lists of capes.\nConstant notes flew backwards and forwards between the Prince, the\nQueen, and the tutors, with inquiries, with reports of progress, with\ndetailed recommendations; and these notes were all carefully preserved\nfor future reference. It was, besides, vital that the heir to the throne\nshould be protected from the slightest possibility of contamination from\nthe outside world. The Prince of Wales was not as other boys; he might,\noccasionally, be allowed to invite some sons of the nobility, boys of\ngood character, to play with him in the garden of Buckingham Palace;\nbut his father presided, with alarming precision, over their sports. In\nshort, every possible precaution was taken, every conceivable effort\nwas made. Yet, strange to say, the object of all this vigilance and\nsolicitude continued to be unsatisfactory--appeared, in fact, to be\npositively growing worse. It was certainly very odd: the more lessons\nthat Bertie had to do, the less he did them; and the more carefully he\nwas guarded against excitements and frivolities, the more desirous\nof mere amusement he seemed to become. Albert was deeply grieved and\nVictoria was sometimes very angry; but grief and anger produced no more\neffect than supervision and time-tables. The Prince of Wales, in\nspite of everything, grew up into manhood without the faintest sign of\n\"adherence to and perseverance in the plan both of studies and life--\"\nas one of the Royal memoranda put it--which had been laid down with such",

After all, the Solent was a feeble\nbarrier. Oh, for some distant, some almost inaccessible sanctuary,\nwhere, in true domestic privacy, one could make happy holiday, just as\nif--or at least very, very, nearly--one were anybody else! Victoria,\never since, together with Albert, she had visited Scotland in the early\nyears of her marriage, had felt that her heart was in the Highlands. She\nhad returned to them a few years later, and her passion had grown. How\nromantic they were! And how Albert enjoyed them too! His spirits rose\nquite wonderfully as soon as he found himself among the hills and the\nconifers. \"It is a happiness to see him,\" she wrote. \"Oh! What can equal\nthe beauties of nature!\" she exclaimed in her journal, during one of\nthese visits. \"What enjoyment there is in them! Albert enjoys it so\nmuch; he is in ecstasies here.\" \"Albert said,\" she noted next day, \"that\nthe chief beauty of mountain scenery consists in its frequent changes.\nWe came home at six o'clock.\" Then she went on a longer expedition--up\nto the very top of a high hill. \"It was quite romantic. Here we were\nwith only this Highlander behind us holding the ponies (for we got off\ntwice and walked about). . . . We came home at half-past eleven,--the\nmost delightful, most romantic ride and walk I ever had. I had never\nbeen up such a mountain, and then the day was so fine.\" The Highlanders,\ntoo, were such astonishing people. They \"never make difficulties,\" she\nnoted, \"but are cheerful, and happy, and merry, and ready to walk,\nand run, and do anything.\" As for Albert he \"highly appreciated the\ngood-breeding, simplicity, and intelligence, which make it so pleasant\nand even instructive to talk to them.\" \"We were always in the habit,\"\nwrote Her Majesty, \"of conversing with the Highlanders--with whom one\ncomes so much in contact in the Highlands.\" She loved everything about\nthem--their customs, their dress, their dances, even their musical\ninstruments. \"There were nine pipers at the castle,\" she wrote after\nstaying with Lord Breadalbane; \"sometimes one and sometimes three\nplayed. They always played about breakfast-time, again during the\nmorning, at luncheon, and also whenever we went in and out; again before\ndinner, and during most of dinner-time. We both have become quite fond\nof the bag-pipes.\"\nIt was quite impossible not to wish to return to such pleasures again\nand again; and in 1848 the Queen took a lease of Balmoral House, a small\nresidence near Braemar in the wilds of Aberdeenshire. Four years later\nshe bought the place outright. Now she could be really happy every\nsummer; now she could be simple and at her ease; now she could\nbe romantic every evening, and dote upon Albert, without a single\ndistraction, all day long. The diminutive scale of the house was in\nitself a charm. Nothing was more amusing than to find oneself living\nin two or three little sitting--rooms, with the children crammed away\nupstairs, and the minister in attendance with only a tiny bedroom to do\nall his work in. And then to be able to run in and out of doors as one\nliked, and to sketch, and to walk, and to watch the red deer coming so\nsurprisingly close, and to pay visits to the cottagers! And occasionally\none could be more adventurous still--one could go and stay for a night\nor two at the Bothie at Alt-na-giuthasach--a mere couple of huts with \"a\nwooden addition\"--and only eleven people in the whole party! And there\nwere mountains to be climbed and cairns to be built in solemn pomp. \"At\nlast, when the cairn, which is, I think, seven or eight feet high, was\nnearly completed, Albert climbed up to the top of it, and placed the\nlast stone; after which three cheers were given. It was a gay, pretty,\nand touching sight; and I felt almost inclined to cry. The view was\nso beautiful over the dear hills; the day so fine; the whole so\ngemuthlich.\" And in the evening there were sword-dances and reels.\nBut Albert had determined to pull down the little old house, and to\nbuild in its place a castle of his own designing. With great ceremony,\nin accordance with a memorandum drawn up by the Prince for the occasion,\nthe foundation-stone of the new edifice was laid, and by 1855 it was\nhabitable. Spacious, built of granite in the Scotch baronial style, with\na tower 100 feet high, and minor turrets and castellated gables,\nthe castle was skilfully arranged to command the finest views of the\nsurrounding mountains and of the neighbouring river Dee. Upon the\ninterior decorations Albert and Victoria lavished all their care. The\nwall and the floors were of pitch-pine, and covered with specially\nmanufactured tartars. The Balmoral tartan, in red and grey, designed by\nthe Prince, and the Victoria tartan, with a white stripe, designed by\nthe Queen, were to be seen in every room: there were tartan curtains,\nand tartan chair-covers, and even tartan linoleums. Occasionally the\nRoyal Stuart tartan appeared, for Her Majesty always maintained that she\nwas an ardent Jacobite. Water-colour sketches by Victoria hung upon the\nwalls, together with innumerable stags' antlers, and the head of a boar,\nwhich had been shot by Albert in Germany. In an alcove in the hall,\nstood a life-sized statue of Albert in Highland dress.\nVictoria declared that it was perfection. \"Every year,\" she wrote, \"my\nheart becomes more fixed in this dear paradise, and so much more so\nnow, that ALL has become my dear Albert's own creation, own work, own\nbuilding, own lay-out... and his great taste, and the impress of his\ndear hand, have been stamped everywhere.\"\nAnd here, in very truth, her happiest days were passed. In after years,\nwhen she looked back upon them, a kind of glory, a radiance as of\nan unearthly holiness, seemed to glow about these golden hours. Each\nhallowed moment stood out clear, beautiful, eternally significant. For,\nat the time, every experience there, sentimental, or grave, or trivial,\nhad come upon her with a peculiar vividness, like a flashing of\nmarvellous lights. Albert's stalkings--an evening walk when she lost her\nway--Vicky sitting down on a wasps' nest--a torchlight dance--with what\nintensity such things, and ten thousand like them, impressed themselves\nupon her eager consciousness! And how she flew to her journal to note\nthem down! The news of the Duke's death! What a moment--when, as she\nsat sketching after a picnic by a loch in the lonely hills, Lord Derby's\nletter had been brought to her, and she had learnt that \"ENGLAND'S, or\nrather BRITAIN'S pride, her glory, her hero, the greatest man she had\never produced, was no morel.\" For such were here reflections upon\nthe \"old rebel\" of former days. But that past had been utterly\nobliterated--no faintest memory of it remained. For years she had\nlooked up to the Duke as a figure almost superhuman. Had he not been a\nsupporter of good Sir Robert? Had he not asked Albert to succeed him as\ncommander-in-chief? And what a proud moment it had been when he stood as\nsponsor to her son Arthur, who was born on his eighty-first birthday! So\nnow she filled a whole page of her diary with panegyrical regrets. \"His\nposition was the highest a subject ever had--above party--looked up to\nby all--revered by the whole nation--the friend of the Sovereign... The\nCrown never possessed--and I fear never WILL--so DEVOTED, loyal,\nand faithful a subject, so staunch a supporter! To US his loss is\nIRREPARABLE... To Albert he showed the greatest kindness and the utmost\nconfidence... Not an eye will be dry in the whole country.\" These were\nserious thoughts; but they were soon succeeded by others hardly less\nmoving--by events as impossible to forget--by Mr. MacLeod's sermon\non Nicodemus--by the gift of a red flannel petticoat to Mrs. P.\nFarquharson, and another to old Kitty Kear.\nBut, without doubt, most memorable, most delightful of all were the\nexpeditions--the rare, exciting expeditions up distant mountains, across\nbroad rivers, through strange country, and lasting several days. With\nonly two gillies--Grant and Brown--for servants, and with assumed names.\nIt was more like something in a story than real life. \"We had decided\nto call ourselves LORD AND LADY CHURCHILL AND AND PARTY--Lady Churchill\npassing as MISS SPENCER and General Grey as DR. GREY! Brown once forgot\nthis and called me 'Your Majesty' as I was getting into the carriage,\nand Grant on the box once called Albert 'Your Royal Highness,' which\nset us off laughing, but no one observed it.\" Strong, vigorous,\nenthusiastic, bringing, so it seemed, good fortune with her--the\nHighlanders declared she had \"a lucky foot\"--she relished\neverything--the scrambles and the views and the contretemps and the\nrough inns with their coarse fare and Brown and Grant waiting at table.\nShe could have gone on for ever and ever, absolutely happy with Albert\nbeside her and Brown at her pony's head. But the time came for turning\nhomewards, alas! the time came for going back to England. She could\nhardly bear it; she sat disconsolate in her room and watched the snow\nfalling. The last day! Oh! If only she could be snowed up!\nIII\nThe Crimean War brought new experiences, and most of them were pleasant\nones. It was pleasant to be patriotic and pugnacious, to look out\nappropriate prayers to be read in the churches, to have news of",

With that spontaneity of feeling which was so\npeculiarly her own, Victoria poured out her emotion, her admiration,\nher pity, her love, upon her \"dear soldiers.\" When she gave them their\nmedals her exultation knew no bounds. \"Noble fellows!\" she wrote to the\nKing of the Belgians, \"I own I feel as if these were MY OWN CHILDREN;\nmy heart beats for THEM as for my NEAREST and DEAREST.

When General\nWilliams returned from the heroic defence of Kars and was presented at\nCourt, the quick, stiff, distant bow with which the Prince received him\nstruck like ice upon the beholders. He was a stranger still.\nBut he had other things to occupy him, more important, surely, than the\npersonal impressions of military officers and people who went to Court.\nHe was at work--ceaselessly at work--on the tremendous task of carrying\nthrough the war to a successful conclusion. State papers, despatches,\nmemoranda, poured from him in an overwhelming stream. Between 1853 and\n1857 fifty folio volumes were filled with the comments of his pen upon\nthe Eastern question. Nothing would induce him to stop. Weary ministers\nstaggered under the load of his advice; but his advice continued, piling\nitself up over their writing-tables, and flowing out upon them from\nred box after red box. Nor was it advice to be ignored. The talent for\nadministration which had reorganised the royal palaces and planned the\nGreat Exhibition asserted itself no less in the confused complexities of\nwar. Again and again the Prince's suggestions, rejected or unheeded at\nfirst, were adopted under the stress of circumstances and found to be\nfull of value. The enrolment of a foreign legion, the establishment of\na depot for troops at Malta, the institution of periodical reports and\ntabulated returns as to the condition of the army at Sebastopol--such\nwere the contrivances and the achievements of his indefatigable brain.\nHe went further: in a lengthy minute he laid down the lines for a\nradical reform in the entire administration of the army. This was\npremature, but his proposal that \"a camp of evolution\" should be\ncreated, in which troops should be concentrated and drilled, proved to\nbe the germ of Aldershot.\nMeanwhile Victoria had made a new friend: she had suddenly been\ncaptivated by Napoleon III. Her dislike of him had been strong at first.\nShe considered that he was a disreputable adventurer who had usurped the\nthrone of poor old Louis Philippe; and besides he was hand-in-glove\nwith Lord Palmerston. For a long time, although he was her ally, she was\nunwilling to meet him; but at last a visit of the Emperor and Empress to\nEngland was arranged. Directly he appeared at Windsor her heart began\nto soften. She found that she was charmed by his quiet manners, his\nlow, soft voice, and by the soothing simplicity of his conversation. The\ngood-will of England was essential to the Emperor's position in Europe,\nand he had determined to fascinate the Queen. He succeeded. There was\nsomething deep within her which responded immediately and vehemently to\nnatures that offered a romantic contrast with her own. Her adoration\nof Lord Melbourne was intimately interwoven with her half-unconscious\nappreciation of the exciting unlikeness between herself and that\nsophisticated, subtle, aristocratical old man. Very different was the\nquality of her unlikeness to Napoleon; but its quantity was at least\nas great. From behind the vast solidity of her respectability, her\nconventionality, her established happiness, she peered out with a\nstrange delicious pleasure at that unfamiliar, darkly-glittering foreign\nobject, moving so meteorically before her, an ambiguous creature of\nwilfulness and Destiny. And, to her surprise, where she had dreaded\nantagonisms, she discovered only sympathies. He was, she said, \"so\nquiet, so simple, naif even, so pleased to be informed about things he\ndoes not know, so gentle, so full of tact, dignity, and modesty, so full\nof kind attention towards us, never saying a word, or doing a thing,\nwhich could put me out... There is something fascinating, melancholy,\nand engaging which draws you to him, in spite of any prevention you may\nhave against him, and certainly without the assistance of any outward\nappearance, though I like his face.\" She observed that he rode\n\"extremely well, and looks well on horseback, as he sits high.\" And\nhe danced \"with great dignity and spirit.\" Above all, he listened to\nAlbert; listened with the most respectful attention; showed, in fact,\nhow pleased he was \"to be informed about things he did not know;\" and\nafterwards was heard to declare that he had never met the Prince's\nequal. On one occasion, indeed--but only on one--he had seemed to grow\nslightly restive. In a diplomatic conversation, \"I expatiated a little\non the Holstein question,\" wrote the Prince in a memorandum, \"which\nappeared to bore the Emperor as 'tres compliquee.'\"\nVictoria, too, became much attached to the Empress, whose looks and\ngraces she admired without a touch of jealousy. Eugenie, indeed, in\nthe plenitude of her beauty, exquisitely dressed in wonderful Parisian\ncrinolines which set off to perfection her tall and willowy figure,\nmight well have caused some heart-burning in the breast of her hostess,\nwho, very short, rather stout, quite plain, in garish middle-class\ngarments, could hardly be expected to feel at her best in such company.\nBut Victoria had no misgivings. To her it mattered nothing that her\nface turned red in the heat and that her purple pork-pie hat was of last\nyear's fashion, while Eugenie, cool and modish, floated in an infinitude\nof flounces by her side. She was Queen of England, and was not that\nenough? It certainly seemed to be; true majesty was hers, and she knew\nit. More than once, when the two were together in public, it was the\nwoman to whom, as it seemed, nature and art had given so little, who,\nby the sheer force of an inherent grandeur, completely threw her adorned\nand beautiful companion into the shade.\nThere were tears when the moment came for parting, and Victoria felt\n\"quite wehmuthig,\" as her guests went away from Windsor. But before long\nshe and Albert paid a return visit to France, where everything was very\ndelightful, and she drove incognito through the streets of Paris in a\n\"common bonnet,\" and saw a play in the theatre at St. Cloud, and, one\nevening, at a great party given by the Emperor in her honour at the\nChateau of Versailles, talked a little to a distinguished-looking\nPrussian gentleman, whose name was Bismarck. Her rooms were furnished\nso much to her taste that she declared they gave her quite a home\nfeeling--that, if her little dog were there, she should really imagine\nherself at home. Nothing was said, but three days later her little\ndog barked a welcome to her as she entered the apartments. The Emperor\nhimself, sparing neither trouble nor expense, had personally arranged\nthe charming surprise. Such were his attentions. She returned to England\nmore enchanted than ever. \"Strange indeed,\" she exclaimed, \"are the\ndispensations and ways of Providence!\"\nThe alliance prospered, and the war drew towards a conclusion. Both the\nQueen and the Prince, it is true, were most anxious that there should\nnot be a premature peace. When Lord Aberdeen wished to open negotiations\nAlbert attacked him in a \"geharnischten\" letter, while Victoria rode\nabout on horseback reviewing the troops. At last, however, Sebastopol\nwas captured. The news reached Balmoral late at night, and in a few\nminutes Albert and all the gentlemen in every species of attire sallied\nforth, followed by all the servants, and gradually by all the population\nof the village-keepers, gillies, workmen--\"up to the top of the cairn.\"\nA bonfire was lighted, the pipes were played, and guns were shot off.\n\"About three-quarters of an hour after Albert came down and said the\nscene had been wild and exciting beyond everything. The people had\nbeen drinking healths in whisky and were in great ecstasy.\" The \"great\necstasy,\" perhaps, would be replaced by other feelings next morning;\nbut at any rate the war was over--though, to be sure, its end seemed as\ndifficult to account for as its beginning. The dispensations and ways of\nProvidence continued to be strange.\nIV",

The Prince and the\nMinister drew together over their hostility to Russia, and thus it came\nabout that when Victoria found it necessary to summon her old enemy to\nform an administration she did so without reluctance. The premiership,\ntoo, had a sobering effect upon Palmerston; he grew less impatient and\ndictatorial; considered with attention the suggestions of the Crown, and\nwas, besides, genuinely impressed by the Prince's ability and knowledge.\nFriction, no doubt, there still occasionally was, for, while the Queen\nand the Prince devoted themselves to foreign politics as much as ever,\ntheir views, when the war was over, became once more antagonistic to\nthose of the Prime Minister. This was especially the case with regard\nto Italy. Albert, theoretically the friend of constitutional government,\ndistrusted Cavour, was horrified by Garibaldi, and dreaded the danger\nof England being drawn into war with Austria. Palmerston, on the other\nhand, was eager for Italian independence; but he was no longer at the\nForeign Office, and the brunt of the royal displeasure had now to be\nborne by Lord John Russell. In a few years the situation had curiously\naltered. It was Lord John who now filled the subordinate and the\nungrateful role; but the Foreign Secretary, in his struggle with\nthe Crown, was supported, instead of opposed, by the Prime Minister.\nNevertheless the struggle was fierce, and the policy, by which the\nvigorous sympathy of England became one of the decisive factors in the\nfinal achievement of Italian unity, was only carried through in face of\nthe violent opposition of the Court.",

Albert's great\nwish was for a united Germany under the leadership of a constitutional\nand virtuous Prussia; Palmerston did not think that there was much to\nbe said for the scheme, but he took no particular interest in German\npolitics, and was ready enough to agree to a proposal which was warmly\nsupported by both the Prince and the Queen--that the royal Houses of\nEngland and Prussia should be united by the marriage of the Princess\nRoyal with the Prussian Crown Prince. Accordingly, when the Princess was\nnot yet fifteen, the Prince, a young man of twenty-four, came over on\na visit to Balmoral, and the betrothal took place. Two years later,\nin 1857, the marriage was celebrated. At the last moment, however, it\nseemed that there might be a hitch. It was pointed out in Prussia that\nit was customary for Princes of the blood royal to be married in Berlin,\nand it was suggested that there was no reason why the present case\nshould be treated as an exception. When this reached the ears of\nVictoria, she was speechless with indignation. In a note, emphatic\neven for Her Majesty, she instructed the Foreign Secretary to tell\nthe Prussian Ambassador \"not to ENTERTAIN the POSSIBILITY of such a\nquestion... The Queen NEVER could consent to it, both for public and for\nprivate reasons, and the assumption of its being TOO MUCH for a Prince\nRoyal of Prussia to come over to marry the Princess Royal of Great\nBritain in England is too ABSURD to say the least. . . Whatever may be\nthe usual practice of Prussian princes, it is not EVERY day that one\nmarries the eldest daughter of the Queen of England. The question must\ntherefore be considered as settled and closed.\" It was, and the\nwedding took place in St. James's Chapel. There were great\nfestivities--illuminations, state concerts, immense crowds, and general\nrejoicings. At Windsor a magnificent banquet was given to the bride and\nbridegroom in the Waterloo room, at which, Victoria noted in her diary,\n\"everybody was most friendly and kind about Vicky and full of the\nuniversal enthusiasm, of which the Duke of Buccleuch gave us most\npleasing instances, he having been in the very thick of the crowd and\namong the lowest of the low.\" Her feelings during several days had been\ngrowing more and more emotional, and when the time came for the young\ncouple to depart she very nearly broke down--but not quite. \"Poor dear\nchild!\" she wrote afterwards. \"I clasped her in my arms and blessed her,\nand knew not what to say. I kissed good Fritz and pressed his hand again\nand again. He was unable to speak and the tears were in his eyes. I\nembraced them both again at the carriage door, and Albert got into the\ncarriage, an open one, with them and Bertie... The band struck up. I\nwished good-bye to the good Perponchers. General Schreckenstein was much\naffected. I pressed his hand, and the good Dean's, and then went quickly\nupstairs.\"",

            "text": "Albert, as well as General Schreckenstein, was much affected. He was\nlosing his favourite child, whose opening intelligence had already begun\nto display a marked resemblance to his own--an adoring pupil, who, in\na few years, might have become an almost adequate companion. An ironic\nfate had determined that the daughter who was taken from him should be\nsympathetic, clever, interested in the arts and sciences, and endowed\nwith a strong taste for memoranda, while not a single one of these\nqualities could be discovered in the son who remained. For certainly\nthe Prince of Wales did not take after his father. Victoria's prayer had\nbeen unanswered, and with each succeeding year it became more obvious\nthat Bertie was a true scion of the House of Brunswick. But these\nevidences of innate characteristics only served to redouble the efforts\nof his parents; it still might not be too late to incline the young\nbranch, by ceaseless pressure and careful fastenings, to grow in\nthe proper direction. Everything was tried. The boy was sent on a\ncontinental tour with a picked body of tutors, but the results were\nunsatisfactory. At his father's request he kept a diary which, on his\nreturn, was inspected by the Prince. It was found to be distressingly\nmeagre: what a multitude of highly interesting reflections might have\nbeen arranged under the heading: \"The First Prince of Wales visiting the\nPope!\" But there was not a single one. \"Le jeune prince plaisit a\ntout le monde,\" old Metternich reported to Guizot, \"mais avait l'air\nembarrasse et tres triste.\" On his seventeenth birthday a memorandum\nwas drawn up over the names of the Queen and the Prince informing their\neldest son that he was now entering upon the period of manhood,\nand directing him henceforward to perform the duties of a Christian\ngentleman. \"Life is composed of duties,\" said the memorandum, \"and in\nthe due, punctual and cheerful performance of them the true Christian,\ntrue soldier, and true gentleman is recognised... A new sphere of life\nwill open for you in which you will have to be taught what to do and\nwhat not to do, a subject requiring study more important than any in\nwhich you have hitherto been engaged.\" On receipt of the memorandum\nBertie burst into tears. At the same time another memorandum was drawn\nup, headed \"confidential: for the guidance of the gentlemen appointed\nto attend on the Prince of Wales.\" This long and elaborate document laid\ndown \"certain principles\" by which the \"conduct and demeanour\" of the\ngentlemen were to be regulated \"and which it is thought may conduce to\nthe benefit of the Prince of Wales.\" \"The qualities which distinguish a\ngentleman in society,\" continued this remarkable paper, \"are:--\n(1) His appearance, his deportment and dress.\n(2) The character of his relations with, and treatment of, others.\n(3) His desire and power to acquit himself creditably in conversation or\nwhatever is the occupation of the society with which he mixes.\"\nA minute and detailed analysis of these subheadings followed, filling\nseveral pages, and the memorandum ended with a final exhortation to the\ngentlemen: \"If they will duly appreciate the responsibility of their\nposition, and taking the points above laid down as the outline, will\nexercise their own good sense in acting UPON ALL OCCASIONS all\nupon these principles, thinking no point of detail too minute to be\nimportant, but maintaining one steady consistent line of conduct\nthey may render essential service to the young Prince and justify the\nflattering selection made by the royal parents.\" A year later the young\nPrince was sent to Oxford, where the greatest care was taken that\nhe should not mix with the undergraduates. Yes, everything had been\ntried--everything... with one single exception. The experiment had never\nbeen made of letting Bertie enjoy himself. But why should it have been?\n\"Life is composed of duties.\" What possible place could there be for\nenjoyment in the existence of a Prince of Wales?\nThe same year which deprived Albert of the Princess Royal brought him\nanother and a still more serious loss. The Baron had paid his last visit\nto England. For twenty years, as he himself said in a letter to the King\nof the Belgians, he had performed \"the laborious and exhausting office\nof a paternal friend and trusted adviser\" to the Prince and the Queen.\nHe was seventy; he was tired, physically and mentally; it was time to\ngo. He returned to his home in Coburg, exchanging, once for all, the\nmomentous secrecies of European statecraft for the little-tattle of a\nprovincial capital and the gossip of family life. In his stiff chair\nby the fire he nodded now over old stories--not of emperors and\ngenerals--but of neighbours and relatives and the domestic adventures\nof long ago--the burning of his father's library--and the goat that ran\nupstairs to his sister's room and ran twice round the table and then ran\ndown again. Dyspepsia and depression still attacked him; but, looking\nback over his life, he was not dissatisfied. His conscience was clear.\n\"I have worked as long as I had strength to work,\" he said, \"and for a\npurpose no one can impugn. The consciousness of this is my reward--the\nonly one which I desired to earn.\"\nApparently, indeed, his \"purpose\" had been accomplished. By his wisdom,\nhis patience, and his example he had brought about, in the fullness of\ntime, the miraculous metamorphosis of which he had dreamed. The Prince\nwas his creation. An indefatigable toiler, presiding, for the highest\nends, over a great nation--that was his achievement; and he looked upon\nhis work and it was good. But had the Baron no misgivings? Did he never\nwonder whether, perhaps, he might have accomplished not too little but\ntoo much? How subtle and how dangerous are the snares which fate lays\nfor the wariest of men! Albert, certainly, seemed to be everything\nthat Stockmar could have wished--virtuous, industrious, persevering,\nintelligent. And yet--why was it--all was not well with him? He was sick\nat heart.\nFor in spite of everything he had never reached to happiness. His work,\nfor which at last he came to crave with an almost morbid appetite, was\na solace and not a cure; the dragon of his dissatisfaction devoured with\ndark relish that ever-growing tribute of laborious days and nights;\nbut it was hungry still. The causes of his melancholy were hidden,\nmysterious, unanalysable perhaps--too deeply rooted in the innermost\nrecesses of his temperament for the eye of reason to apprehend. There\nwere contradictions in his nature, which, to some of those who knew him\nbest, made him seem an inexplicable enigma: he was severe and gentle; he\nwas modest and scornful; he longed for affection and he was cold. He was\nlonely, not merely with the loneliness of exile but with the loneliness\nof conscious and unrecognised superiority. He had the pride, at once\nresigned and overweening, of a doctrinaire. And yet to say that he\nwas simply a doctrinaire would be a false description; for the pure\ndoctrinaire rejoices always in an internal contentment, and Albert was\nvery far from doing that. There was something that he wanted and that\nhe could never get. What was it? Some absolute, some ineffable sympathy?\nSome extraordinary, some sublime success? Possibly, it was a mixture\nof both. To dominate and to be understood! To conquer, by the same\ntriumphant influence, the submission and the appreciation of men--that\nwould be worth while indeed! But, to such imaginations, he saw too\nclearly how faint were the responses of his actual environment. Who was\nthere who appreciated him, really and truly? Who COULD appreciate him\nin England? And, if the gentle virtue of an inward excellence availed so\nlittle, could he expect more from the hard ways of skill and force? The\nterrible land of his exile loomed before him a frigid, an impregnable\nmass. Doubtless he had made some slight impression: it was true that\nhe had gained the respect of his fellow workers, that his probity, his\nindustry, his exactitude, had been recognised, that he was a highly\ninfluential, an extremely important man. But how far, how very far,\nwas all this from the goal of his ambitions! How feeble and futile his\nefforts seemed against the enormous coagulation of dullness, of folly,\nof slackness, of ignorance, of confusion that confronted him! He might\nhave the strength or the ingenuity to make some small change for the\nbetter here or there--to rearrange some detail, to abolish some anomaly,\nto insist upon some obvious reform; but the heart of the appalling\norganism remained untouched. England lumbered on, impervious and\nself-satisfied, in her old intolerable course. He threw himself across\nthe path of the monster with rigid purpose and set teeth, but he was\nbrushed aside. Yes! even Palmerston was still unconquered--was still\nthere to afflict him with his jauntiness, his muddle-headedness, his\nutter lack of principle. It was too much. Neither nature nor the Baron\nhad given him a sanguine spirit; the seeds of pessimism, once lodged\nwithin him, flourished in a propitious soil. He\n\"questioned things, and did not find\nOne that would answer to his mind;\nAnd all the world appeared unkind.\"\nHe believed that he was a failure and he began to despair.\nYet Stockmar had told him that he must \"never relax,\" and he never\nwould. He would go on, working to the utmost and striving for the\nhighest, to the bitter end. His industry grew almost maniacal.\nEarlier and earlier was the green lamp lighted; more vast grew the\ncorrespondence; more searching the examination of the newspapers; the\ninterminable memoranda more punctilious, analytical, and precise. His\nvery recreations became duties. He enjoyed himself by time-table, went\ndeer-stalking with meticulous gusto, and made puns at lunch--it was the\nright thing to do. The mechanism worked with astonishing efficiency,\nbut it never rested and it was never oiled. In dry exactitude the\ninnumerable cog-wheels perpetually revolved. No, whatever happened, the\nPrince would not relax; he had absorbed the doctrines of Stockmar too\nthoroughly. He knew what was right, and, at all costs, he would\npursue it. That was certain. But alas! in this our life what are the\ncertainties? \"In nothing be over-zealous!\" says an old Greek. \"The due\nmeasure in all the works of man is best. For often one who zealously\npushes towards some excellence, though he be pursuing a gain, is really\nbeing led utterly astray by the will of some Power, which makes those\nthings that are evil seem to him good, and those things seem to him evil\nthat are for his advantage.\" Surely, both the Prince and the Baron might\nhave learnt something from the frigid wisdom of Theognis.\nVictoria noticed that her husband sometimes seemed to be depressed and\noverworked. She tried to cheer him up. Realising uneasily that he was\nstill regarded as a foreigner, she hoped that by conferring upon him\nthe title of Prince Consort (1857) she would improve his position in the\ncountry. \"The Queen has a right to claim that her husband should be an\nEnglishman,\" she wrote. But unfortunately, in spite of the Royal Letters\nPatent, Albert remained as foreign as before; and as the years passed\nhis dejection deepened. She worked with him, she watched over him, she\nwalked with him through the woods at Osborne, while he whistled to the\nnightingales, as he had whistled once at Rosenau so long ago. When his\nbirthday came round, she took the greatest pains to choose him presents\nthat he would really like. In 1858, when he was thirty-nine, she gave\nhim \"a picture of Beatrice, life-size, in oil, by Horsley, a complete\ncollection of photographic views of Gotha and the country round, which I\nhad taken by Bedford, and a paper-weight of Balmoral granite and deers'\nteeth, designed by Vicky.\" Albert was of course delighted, and his\nmerriment at the family gathering was more pronounced than ever: and\nyet... what was there that was wrong?\nNo doubt it was his health. He was wearing himself out in the service of\nthe country; and certainly his constitution, as Stockmar had perceived\nfrom the first, was ill-adapted to meet a serious strain. He was easily\nupset; he constantly suffered from minor ailments. His appearance in\nitself was enough to indicate the infirmity of his physical powers. The\nhandsome youth of twenty years since with the flashing eyes and the soft\ncomplexion had grown into a sallow, tired-looking man, whose body, in\nits stoop and its loose fleshiness, betrayed the sedentary labourer,\nand whose head was quite bald on the top. Unkind critics, who had once\ncompared Albert to an operatic tenor, might have remarked that there was\nsomething of the butler about him now. Beside Victoria, he presented a\npainful contrast. She, too, was stout, but it was with the plumpness of\na vigorous matron; and an eager vitality was everywhere visible--in her\nenergetic bearing, her protruding, enquiring glances, her small, fat,\ncapable, and commanding hands. If only, by some sympathetic magic, she\ncould have conveyed into that portly, flabby figure, that desiccated and\ndiscouraged brain, a measure of the stamina and the self-assurance which\nwere so pre-eminently hers!\nBut suddenly she was reminded that there were other perils besides those\nof ill-health. During a visit to Coburg in 1860, the Prince was very\nnearly killed in a carriage accident. He escaped with a few cuts and\nbruises; but Victoria's alarm was extreme, though she concealed it. \"It\nis when the Queen feels most deeply,\" she wrote afterwards, \"that she\nalways appears calmest, and she could not and dared not allow herself\nto speak of what might have been, or even to admit to herself (and she\ncannot and dare not now) the entire danger, for her head would turn!\"\nHer agitation, in fact, was only surpassed by her thankfulness to God.\nShe felt, she said, that she could not rest \"without doing something to\nmark permanently her feelings,\" and she decided that she would endow a\ncharity in Coburg. \"L1,000, or even L2,000, given either at once, or\nin instalments yearly, would not, in the Queen's opinion, be too much.\"\nEventually, the smaller sum having been fixed upon, it was invested in\na trust, called the \"Victoria-Stift,\" in the name of the Burgomaster and",

            "text": "chief clergyman of Coburg, who were directed to distribute the interest\nyearly among a certain number of young men and women of exemplary\ncharacter belonging to the humbler ranks of life.\nShortly afterwards the Queen underwent, for the first time in her life,\nthe actual experience of close personal loss. Early in 1861 the Duchess\nof Kent was taken seriously ill, and in March she died. The event\noverwhelmed Victoria. With a morbid intensity, she filled her diary\nfor pages with minute descriptions of her mother's last hours, her\ndissolution, and her corpse, interspersed with vehement apostrophes, and\nthe agitated outpourings of emotional reflection. In the grief of the\npresent the disagreements of the past were totally forgotten. It was the\nhorror and the mystery of Death--Death, present and actual--that seized\nupon the imagination of the Queen. Her whole being, so instinct with\nvitality, recoiled in agony from the grim spectacle of the triumph of\nthat awful power. Her own mother, with whom she had lived so closely and\nso long that she had become a part almost of her existence, had fallen\ninto nothingness before her very eyes! She tried to forget, but she\ncould not. Her lamentations continued with a strange abundance, a\nstrange persistency. It was almost as if, by some mysterious and\nunconscious precognition, she realised that for her, in an especial\nmanner, that grisly Majesty had a dreadful dart in store.\nFor indeed, before the year was out, a far more terrible blow was\nto fall upon her. Albert, who had for long been suffering from\nsleeplessness, went, on a cold and drenching day towards the end of\nNovember, to inspect the buildings for the new Military Academy at\nSandhurst. On his return, it was clear that the fatigue and exposure to\nwhich he had been subjected had seriously affected his health. He was\nattacked by rheumatism, his sleeplessness continued, and he complained\nthat he felt thoroughly unwell. Three days later a painful duty obliged\nhim to visit Cambridge. The Prince of Wales, who had been placed at that\nUniversity in the previous year, was behaving in such a manner that\na parental visit and a parental admonition had become necessary. The\ndisappointed father, suffering in mind and body, carried through his\ntask; but, on his return journey to Windsor, he caught a fatal chill.\nDuring the next week he gradually grew weaker and more miserable. Yet,\ndepressed and enfeebled as he was, he continued to work. It so happened\nthat at that very moment a grave diplomatic crisis had arisen. Civil\nwar had broken out in America, and it seemed as if England, owing to a\nviolent quarrel with the Northern States, was upon the point of being\ndrawn into the conflict. A severe despatch by Lord John Russell was\nsubmitted to the Queen; and the Prince perceived that, if it was sent\noff unaltered, war would be the almost inevitable consequence. At seven\no'clock on the morning of December 1, he rose from his bed, and with a\nquavering hand wrote a series of suggestions for the alteration of the\ndraft, by which its language might be softened, and a way left open for\na peaceful solution of the question. These changes were accepted by the\nGovernment, and war was averted. It was the Prince's last memorandum.\nHe had always declared that he viewed the prospect of death with\nequanimity. \"I do not cling to life,\" he had once said to Victoria. \"You\ndo; but I set no store by it.\" And then he had added: \"I am sure, if I\nhad a severe illness, I should give up at once, I should not struggle\nfor life. I have no tenacity of life.\" He had judged correctly. Before\nhe had been ill many days, he told a friend that he was convinced he\nwould not recover. He sank and sank. Nevertheless, if his case had\nbeen properly understood and skilfully treated from the first, he might\nconceivably have been saved; but the doctors failed to diagnose his\nsymptoms; and it is noteworthy that his principal physician was Sir\nJames Clark. When it was suggested that other advice should be taken,\nSir James pooh-poohed the idea: \"there was no cause for alarm,\" he said.\nBut the strange illness grew worse. At last, after a letter of fierce\nremonstrance from Palmerston, Dr. Watson was sent for; and Dr. Watson\nsaw at once that he had come too late The Prince was in the grip of\ntyphoid fever. \"I think that everything so far is satisfactory,\" said\nSir James Clark.(*)\n(*) Clarendon, II, 253-4: \"One cannot speak with certainty;\nbut it is horrible to think that such a life MAY have been\nsacrificed to Sir J. Clark's selfish jealousy of every\nmember of his profession.\" The Earl of Clarendon to the\nDuchess of Manchester, December 17, 1861.\nThe restlessness and the acute suffering of the earlier days gave place\nto a settled torpor and an ever--deepening gloom. Once the failing\npatient asked for music--\"a fine chorale at a distance;\" and a piano\nhaving been placed in the adjoining room, Princess Alice played on it\nsome of Luther's hymns, after which the Prince repeated \"The Rock of\nAges.\" Sometimes his mind wandered; sometimes the distant past came\nrushing upon him; he heard the birds in the early morning, and was at\nRosenau again, a boy. Or Victoria would come and read to him \"Peveril\nof the Peak,\" and he showed that he could follow the story, and then she\nwould bend over him, and he would murmur \"liebes Frauchen\" and \"gutes\nWeibchen,\" stroking her cheek. Her distress and her agitation were\ngreat, but she was not seriously frightened. Buoyed up by her own\nabundant energies, she would not believe that Albert's might prove\nunequal to the strain. She refused to face such a hideous possibility.\nShe declined to see Dr. Watson. Why should she? Had not Sir James Clark\nassured her that all would be well? Only two days before the end, which\nwas seen now to be almost inevitable by everyone about her, she wrote,\nfull of apparent confidence, to the King of the Belgians: \"I do not sit\nup with him at night,\" she said, \"as I could be of no use; and there is\nnothing to cause alarm.\" The Princess Alice tried to tell her the truth,\nbut her hopefulness would not be daunted. On the morning of December\n14, Albert, just as she had expected, seemed to be better; perhaps\nthe crisis was over. But in the course of the day there was a serious\nrelapse. Then at last she allowed herself to see that she was standing\non the edge of an appalling gulf. The whole family was summoned, and,\none after another, the children took a silent farewell of their father.\n\"It was a terrible moment,\" Victoria wrote in her diary, \"but, thank\nGod! I was able to command myself, and to be perfectly calm, and\nremained sitting by his side.\" He murmured something, but she could not\nhear what it was; she thought he was speaking in French. Then all at\nonce he began to arrange his hair, \"just as he used to do when well and\nhe was dressing.\" \"Es kleines Frauchen,\" she whispered to him; and he\nseemed to understand. For a moment, towards the evening, she went into\nanother room, but was immediately called back; she saw at a glance that\na ghastly change had taken place. As she knelt by the bed, he breathed\ndeeply, breathed gently, breathed at last no more. His features became\nperfectly rigid; she shrieked one long wild shriek that rang through the\nterror-stricken castle and understood that she had lost him for ever.\nCHAPTER",

            "text": "I\nThe death of the Prince Consort was the central turning-point in the\nhistory of Queen Victoria. She herself felt that her true life had\nceased with her husband's, and that the remainder of her days upon earth\nwas of a twilight nature--an epilogue to a drama that was done. Nor is\nit possible that her biographer should escape a similar impression. For\nhim, too, there is a darkness over the latter half of that long career.\nThe first forty--two years of the Queen's life are illuminated by a\ngreat and varied quantity of authentic information. With Albert's\ndeath a veil descends. Only occasionally, at fitful and disconnected\nintervals, does it lift for a moment or two; a few main outlines, a\nfew remarkable details may be discerned; the rest is all conjecture and\nambiguity. Thus, though the Queen survived her great bereavement for\nalmost as many years as she had lived before it, the chronicle of those\nyears can bear no proportion to the tale of her earlier life. We must be\ncontent in our ignorance with a brief and summary relation.\nThe sudden removal of the Prince was not merely a matter of overwhelming\npersonal concern to Victoria; it was an event of national, of European\nimportance. He was only forty-two, and in the ordinary course of nature\nhe might have been expected to live at least thirty years longer. Had\nhe done so it can hardly be doubted that the whole development of the\nEnglish polity would have been changed. Already at the time of his death\nhe filled a unique place in English public life; already among the inner\ncircle of politicians he was accepted as a necessary and useful part of\nthe mechanism of the State. Lord Clarendon, for instance, spoke of his\ndeath as \"a national calamity of far greater importance than the public\ndream of,\" and lamented the loss of his \"sagacity and foresight,\" which,\nhe declared, would have been \"more than ever valuable\" in the event of\nan American war. And, as time went on, the Prince's influence must have\nenormously increased. For, in addition to his intellectual and moral\nqualities, he enjoyed, by virtue of his position, one supreme advantage\nwhich every other holder of high office in the country was without: he\nwas permanent. Politicians came and went, but the Prince was perpetually\ninstalled at the centre of affairs. Who can doubt that, towards the end\nof the century, such a man, grown grey in the service of the nation,\nvirtuous, intelligent, and with the unexampled experience of a whole\nlife-time of government, would have acquired an extraordinary prestige?\nIf, in his youth, he had been able to pit the Crown against the mighty\nPalmerston and to come off with equal honours from the contest, of what\nmight he not have been capable in his old age? What Minister,\nhowever able, however popular, could have withstood the wisdom, the\nirreproachability, the vast prescriptive authority, of the venerable\nPrince? It is easy to imagine how, under such a ruler, an attempt might\nhave been made to convert England into a State as exactly organised,\nas elaborately trained, as efficiently equipped, and as autocratically\ncontrolled, as Prussia herself. Then perhaps, eventually, under some\npowerful leader--a Gladstone or a Bright--the democratic forces in the\ncountry might have rallied together, and a struggle might have followed\nin which the Monarchy would have been shaken to its foundations. Or, on\nthe other hand, Disraeli's hypothetical prophecy might have come true.\n\"With Prince Albert,\" he said, \"we have buried our... sovereign. This\nGerman Prince has governed England for twenty-one years with a wisdom\nand energy such as none of our kings have ever shown. If he had outlived\nsome of our 'old stagers' he would have given us the blessings of\nabsolute government.\"\nThe English Constitution--that indescribable entity--is a living thing,\ngrowing with the growth of men, and assuming ever-varying forms in\naccordance with the subtle and complex laws of human character. It is\nthe child of wisdom and chance. The wise men of 1688 moulded it into the\nshape we know, but the chance that George I could not speak English\ngave it one of its essential peculiarities--the system of a Cabinet\nindependent of the Crown and subordinate to the Prime Minister. The\nwisdom of Lord Grey saved it from petrifaction and destruction, and\nset it upon the path of Democracy. Then chance intervened once more; a\nfemale sovereign happened to marry an able and pertinacious man; and\nit seemed likely that an element which had been quiescent within it for\nyears--the element of irresponsible administrative power--was about\nto become its predominant characteristic and to change completely the\ndirection of its growth. But what chance gave chance took away. The\nConsort perished in his prime; and the English Constitution, dropping\nthe dead limb with hardly a tremor, continued its mysterious life as if\nhe had never been.\nOne human being, and one alone, felt the full force of what had\nhappened. The Baron, by his fireside at Coburg, suddenly saw the\ntremendous fabric of his creation crash down into sheer and irremediable\nruin. Albert was gone, and he had lived in vain. Even his blackest\nhypochondria had never envisioned quite so miserable a catastrophe.\nVictoria wrote to him, visited him, tried to console him by declaring\nwith passionate conviction that she would carry on her husband's work.\nHe smiled a sad smile and looked into the fire. Then he murmured that\nhe was going where Albert was--that he would not be long. He shrank into\nhimself. His children clustered round him and did their best to comfort\nhim, but it was useless: the Baron's heart was broken. He lingered for\neighteen months, and then, with his pupil, explored the shadow and the",

            "text": "II\nWith appalling suddenness Victoria had exchanged the serene radiance of\nhappiness for the utter darkness of woe. In the first dreadful moments\nthose about her had feared that she might lose her reason, but the iron\nstrain within her held firm, and in the intervals between the intense\nparoxysms of grief it was observed that the Queen was calm. She\nremembered, too, that Albert had always disapproved of exaggerated\nmanifestations of feeling, and her one remaining desire was to do\nnothing but what he would have wished. Yet there were moments when\nher royal anguish would brook no restraints. One day she sent for the\nDuchess of Sutherland, and, leading her to the Prince's room, fell\nprostrate before his clothes in a flood of weeping, while she adjured\nthe Duchess to tell her whether the beauty of Albert's character had\never been surpassed. At other times a feeling akin to indignation swept\nover her. \"The poor fatherless baby of eight months,\" she wrote to the\nKing of the Belgians, \"is now the utterly heartbroken and crushed widow\nof forty-two! My LIFE as a HAPPY one is ENDED! The world is gone for\nME!... Oh! to be cut off in the prime of life--to see our pure, happy,\nquiet, domestic life, which ALONE enabled me to bear my MUCH disliked\nposition, CUT OFF at forty-two--when I HAD hoped with such instinctive\ncertainty that God never WOULD part us, and would let us grow old\ntogether (though HE always talked of the shortness of life)--is TOO\nAWFUL, too cruel!\" The tone of outraged Majesty seems to be discernible.\nDid she wonder in her heart of hearts how the Deity could have dared?\nBut all other emotions gave way before her overmastering determination\nto continue, absolutely unchanged, and for the rest of her life on\nearth, her reverence, her obedience, her idolatry. \"I am anxious to\nrepeat ONE thing,\" she told her uncle, \"and THAT ONE is my firm resolve,\nmy IRREVOCABLE DECISION, viz., that HIS wishes--HIS plans--about\neverything, HIS views about EVERY thing are to be MY LAW! And NO HUMAN\nPOWER will make me swerve from WHAT HE decided and wished.\" She grew\nfierce, she grew furious, at the thought of any possible intrusion\nbetween her and her desire. Her uncle was coming to visit her, and it\nflashed upon her that HE might try to interfere with her and seek\nto \"rule the roost\" as of old. She would give him a hint. \"I am ALSO\nDETERMINED,\" she wrote, \"that NO ONE person--may HE be ever so good,\never so devoted among my servants--is to lead or guide or dictate TO ME.\nI know HOW he would disapprove it... Though miserably weak and utterly\nshattered, my spirit rises when I think ANY wish or plan of his is to\nbe touched or changed, or I am to be MADE TO DO anything.\" She ended her\nletter in grief and affection. She was, she said, his \"ever wretched but\ndevoted child, Victoria R.\" And then she looked at the date: it was the\n24th of December. An agonising pang assailed her, and she dashed down a\npostcript--\"What a Xmas! I won't think of it.\"\nAt first, in the tumult of her distresses, she declared that she could\nnot see her Ministers, and the Princess Alice, assisted by Sir Charles\nPhipps, the keeper of the Privy Purse, performed, to the best of her\nability, the functions of an intermediary. After a few weeks, however,\nthe Cabinet, through Lord John Russell, ventured to warn the Queen that\nthis could not continue. She realised that they were right: Albert would\nhave agreed with them; and so she sent for the Prime Minister. But when\nLord Palmerston arrived at Osborne, in the pink of health, brisk, with\nhis whiskers freshly dyed, and dressed in a brown overcoat, light grey\ntrousers, green gloves, and blue studs, he did not create a very good\nimpression.\nNevertheless, she had grown attached to her old enemy, and the thought\nof a political change filled her with agitated apprehensions. The\nGovernment, she knew, might fall at any moment; she felt she could not\nface such an eventuality; and therefore, six months after the death of\nthe Prince, she took the unprecedented step of sending a private message\nto Lord Derby, the leader of the Opposition, to tell him that she was\nnot in a fit state of mind or body to undergo the anxiety of a change of\nGovernment, and that if he turned the present Ministers out of office it\nwould be at the risk of sacrificing her life--or her reason. When this\nmessage reached Lord Derby he was considerably surprised. \"Dear me!\" was\nhis cynical comment. \"I didn't think she was so fond of them as THAT.\"\nThough the violence of her perturbations gradually subsided, her\ncheerfulness did not return. For months, for years, she continued in\nsettled gloom. Her life became one of almost complete seclusion. Arrayed\nin thickest crepe, she passed dolefully from Windsor to Osborne, from\nOsborne to Balmoral. Rarely visiting the capital, refusing to take any\npart in the ceremonies of state, shutting herself off from the slightest\nintercourse with society, she became almost as unknown to her subjects\nas some potentate of the East. They might murmur, but they did not\nunderstand. What had she to do with empty shows and vain enjoyments? No!\nShe was absorbed by very different preoccupations. She was the devoted\nguardian of a sacred trust. Her place was in the inmost shrine of the\nhouse of mourning--where she alone had the right to enter, where she\ncould feel the effluence of a mysterious presence, and interpret,\nhowever faintly and feebly, the promptings of a still living soul. That,\nand that only was her glorious, her terrible duty. For terrible indeed\nit was. As the years passed her depression seemed to deepen and her\nloneliness to grow more intense. \"I am on a dreary sad pinnacle of\nsolitary grandeur,\" she said. Again and again she felt that she could\nbear her situation no longer--that she would sink under the strain. And\nthen, instantly, that Voice spoke: and she braced herself once more to\nperform, with minute conscientiousness, her grim and holy task.",

That vast burden of toil which he had taken upon\nhis shoulders it was now for her to bear. She assumed the gigantic\nload; and naturally she staggered under it. While he had lived, she had\nworked, indeed, with regularity and conscientiousness; but it was work\nmade easy, made delicious, by his care, his forethought, his advice,\nand his infallibility. The mere sound of his voice, asking her to sign\na paper, had thrilled her; in such a presence she could have laboured\ngladly for ever. But now there was a hideous change. Now there were no\nneat piles and docketings under the green lamp; now there were no simple\nexplanations of difficult matters; now there was nobody to tell her what\nwas right and what was wrong. She had her secretaries, no doubt: there\nwere Sir Charles Phipps, and General Grey, and Sir Thomas Biddulph; and\nthey did their best. But they were mere subordinates: the whole weight\nof initiative and responsibility rested upon her alone. For so it had to\nbe. \"I am DETERMINED\"--had she not declared it?--\"that NO ONE person is\nto lead or guide or dictate to ME;\" anything else would be a betrayal of\nher trust. She would follow the Prince in all things. He had refused to\ndelegate authority; he had examined into every detail with his own eyes;\nhe had made it a rule never to sign a paper without having first, not\nmerely read it, but made notes on it too. She would do the same. She\nsat from morning till night surrounded by huge heaps of despatch--boxes,\nreading and writing at her desk--at her desk, alas! which stood alone\nnow in the room.\nWithin two years of Albert's death a violent disturbance in foreign\npolitics put Victoria's faithfulness to a crucial test. The fearful\nSchleswig-Holstein dispute, which had been smouldering for more than a\ndecade, showed signs of bursting out into conflagration. The complexity\nof the questions at issue was indescribable. \"Only three people,\"\nsaid Palmerston, \"have ever really understood the Schleswig-Holstein\nbusiness--the Prince Consort, who is dead--a German professor, who\nhas gone mad--and I, who have forgotten all about it.\" But, though the\nPrince might be dead, had he not left a vicegerent behind him?\nVictoria threw herself into the seething embroilment with the vigour of\ninspiration. She devoted hours daily to the study of the affair in all\nits windings; but she had a clue through the labyrinth: whenever the\nquestion had been discussed, Albert, she recollected it perfectly, had\nalways taken the side of Prussia. Her course was clear. She became an\nardent champion of the Prussian point of view. It was a legacy from the\nPrince, she said. She did not realise that the Prussia of the Prince's\nday was dead, and that a new Prussia, the Prussia of Bismarck, was born.\nPerhaps Palmerston, with his queer prescience, instinctively apprehended\nthe new danger; at any rate, he and Lord John were agreed upon the\nnecessity of supporting Denmark against Prussia's claims. But opinion\nwas sharply divided, not only in the country but in the Cabinet. For\neighteen months the controversy raged; while the Queen, with persistent\nvehemence, opposed the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary. When at\nlast the final crisis arose--when it seemed possible that England would\njoin forces with Denmark in a war against Prussia--Victoria's agitation\ngrew febrile in its intensity. Towards her German relatives she\npreserved a discreet appearance of impartiality; but she poured out\nupon her Ministers a flood of appeals, protests, and expostulations. She\ninvoked the sacred cause of Peace. \"The only chance of preserving peace\nfor Europe,\" she wrote, \"is by not assisting Denmark, who has brought\nthis entirely upon herself. The Queen suffers much, and her nerves\nare more and more totally shattered... But though all this anxiety is\nwearing her out, it will not shake her firm purpose of resisting any\nattempt to involve this country in a mad and useless combat.\" She was,\nshe declared, \"prepared to make a stand,\" even if the resignation of the\nForeign Secretary should follow. \"The Queen,\" she told Lord Granville,\n\"is completely exhausted by the anxiety and suspense, and misses her\nbeloved husband's help, advice, support, and love in an overwhelming\nmanner.\" She was so worn out by her efforts for peace that she could\n\"hardly hold up her head or hold her pen.\" England did not go to war,\nand Denmark was left to her fate; but how far the attitude of the Queen\ncontributed to this result it is impossible, with our present knowledge,\nto say. On the whole, however, it seems probable that the determining\nfactor in the situation was the powerful peace party in the Cabinet\nrather than the imperious and pathetic pressure of Victoria.",

            "text": "It is, at any rate, certain that the Queen's enthusiasm for the sacred\ncause of peace was short-lived. Within a few months her mind had\ncompletely altered. Her eyes were opened to the true nature of Prussia,\nwhose designs upon Austria were about to culminate in the Seven Weeks'\nWar. Veering precipitately from one extreme to the other, she now urged\nher Ministers to interfere by force of arms in support of Austria. But\nshe urged in vain.\nHer political activity, no more than her social seclusion, was approved\nby the public. As the years passed, and the royal mourning remained\nas unrelieved as ever, the animadversions grew more general and more\nsevere. It was observed that the Queen's protracted privacy not only\ncast a gloom over high society, not only deprived the populace of its\npageantry, but also exercised a highly deleterious effect upon the\ndressmaking, millinery, and hosiery trades. This latter consideration\ncarried great weight. At last, early in 1864, the rumour spread that Her\nMajesty was about to go out of mourning, and there was much rejoicing\nin the newspapers; but unfortunately it turned out that the rumour was\nquite without foundation. Victoria, with her own hand, wrote a letter\nto The Times to say so. \"This idea,\" she declared, \"cannot be too\nexplicitly contradicted. The Queen,\" the letter continued, \"heartily\nappreciates the desire of her subjects to see her, and whatever she CAN\ndo to gratify them in this loyal and affectionate wish, she WILL do...\nBut there are other and higher duties than those of mere representation\nwhich are now thrown upon the Queen, alone and unassisted--duties which\nshe cannot neglect without injury to the public service, which weigh\nunceasingly upon her, overwhelming her with work and anxiety.\" The\njustification might have been considered more cogent had it not been\nknown that those \"other and higher duties\" emphasised by the Queen\nconsisted for the most part of an attempt to counteract the\nforeign policy of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell. A large\nsection--perhaps a majority--of the nation were violent partisans of\nDenmark in the Schleswig-Holstein quarrel; and Victoria's support of\nPrussia was widely denounced. A wave of unpopularity, which reminded\nold observers of the period preceding the Queen's marriage more than\ntwenty-five years before, was beginning to rise. The press was rude;\nLord Ellenborough attacked the Queen in the House of Lords; there\nwere curious whispers in high quarters that she had had thoughts of\nabdicating--whispers followed by regrets that she had not done so.\nVictoria, outraged and injured, felt that she was misunderstood. She\nwas profoundly unhappy. After Lord Ellenborough's speech, General Grey\ndeclared that he \"had never seen the Queen so completely upset.\"\n\"Oh, how fearful it is,\" she herself wrote to Lord Granville, \"to be\nsuspected--uncheered--unguided and unadvised--and how alone the poor\nQueen feels!\" Nevertheless, suffer as she might, she was as resolute\nas ever; she would not move by a hair's breadth from the course that a\nsupreme obligation marked out for her; she would be faithful to the end.\nAnd so, when Schleswig-Holstein was forgotten, and even the image of the\nPrince had begun to grow dim in the fickle memories of men, the solitary",

            "text": "watcher remained immutably concentrated at her peculiar task. The\nworld's hostility, steadily increasing, was confronted and outfaced by\nthe impenetrable weeds of Victoria. Would the world never understand?\nIt was not mere sorrow that kept her so strangely sequestered; it was\ndevotion, it was self-immolation; it was the laborious legacy of love.\nUnceasingly the pen moved over the black-edged paper. The flesh might be\nweak, but that vast burden must be borne. And fortunately, if the world\nwould not understand, there were faithful friends who did. There was\nLord Granville, and there was kind Mr. Theodore Martin. Perhaps Mr.\nMartin, who was so clever, would find means to make people realise the\nfacts. She would send him a letter, pointing out her arduous labours and\nthe difficulties under which she struggled, and then he might write an\narticle for one of the magazines. \"It is not,\" she told him in 1863,\n\"the Queen's SORROW that keeps her secluded. It is her OVERWHELMING WORK\nand her health, which is greatly shaken by her sorrow, and the totally\noverwhelming amount of work and responsibility--work which she feels\nreally wears her out. Alice Helps was wonderfully struck at the Queen's\nroom; and if Mrs. Martin will look at it, she can tell Mr. Martin what\nsurrounds her. From the hour she gets out of bed till she gets into it\nagain there is work, work, work,--letter-boxes, questions, etc., which\nare dreadfully exhausting--and if she had not comparative rest and\nquiet in the evening she would most likely not be ALIVE. Her brain is\nconstantly overtaxed.\" It was too true.\nIII\nTo carry on Albert's work--that was her first duty; but there was\nanother, second only to that, and yet nearer, if possible, to her\nheart--to impress the true nature of his genius and character upon the\nminds of her subjects. She realised that during his life he had not been\nproperly appreciated; the full extent of his powers, the supreme quality\nof his goodness, had been necessarily concealed; but death had removed\nthe need of barriers, and now her husband, in his magnificent entirety,\nshould stand revealed to all. She set to work methodically. She directed\nSir Arthur Helps to bring out a collection of the Prince's speeches and\naddresses, and the weighty tome appeared in 1862. Then she commanded\nGeneral Grey to write an account of the Prince's early years--from his\nbirth to his marriage; she herself laid down the design of the book,\ncontributed a number of confidential documents, and added numerous\nnotes; General Grey obeyed, and the work was completed in 1866. But\nthe principal part of the story was still untold, and Mr. Martin\nwas forthwith instructed to write a complete biography of the Prince\nConsort. Mr. Martin laboured for fourteen years. The mass of material\nwith which he had to deal was almost incredible, but he was extremely\nindustrious, and he enjoyed throughout the gracious assistance of Her\nMajesty. The first bulky volume was published in 1874; four others\nslowly followed; so that it was not until 1880 that the monumental work\nwas finished.\nMr. Martin was rewarded by a knighthood; and yet it was sadly evident\nthat neither Sir Theodore nor his predecessors had achieved the\npurpose which the Queen had in view. Perhaps she was unfortunate in her\ncoadjutors, but, in reality, the responsibility for the failure must lie\nwith Victoria herself. Sir Theodore and the others faithfully carried\nout the task which she had set them--faithfully put before the public\nthe very image of Albert that filled her own mind. The fatal drawback\nwas that the public did not find that image attractive. Victoria's\nemotional nature, far more remarkable for vigour than for subtlety,\nrejecting utterly the qualifications which perspicuity, or humour,\nmight suggest, could be satisfied with nothing but the absolute and the\ncategorical. When she disliked she did so with an unequivocal emphasis\nwhich swept the object of her repugnance at once and finally outside\nthe pale of consideration; and her feelings of affection were equally\nunmitigated. In the case of Albert her passion for superlatives\nreached its height. To have conceived of him as anything short of\nperfect--perfect in virtue, in wisdom, in beauty, in all the glories and\ngraces of man--would have been an unthinkable blasphemy: perfect he\nwas, and perfect he must be shown to have been. And so, Sir Arthur, Sir\nTheodore, and the General painted him. In the circumstances, and under\nsuch supervision, to have done anything else would have required talents\nconsiderably more distinguished than any that those gentlemen possessed.\nBut that was not all. By a curious mischance Victoria was also able to\npress into her service another writer, the distinction of whose talents\nwas this time beyond a doubt. The Poet Laureate, adopting, either from\ncomplaisance or conviction, the tone of his sovereign, joined in the\nchorus, and endowed the royal formula with the magical resonance of\nverse. This settled the matter. Henceforward it was impossible to forget\nthat Albert had worn the white flower of a blameless life.\nThe result was doubly unfortunate. Victoria, disappointed and chagrined,\nbore a grudge against her people for their refusal, in spite of all her\nefforts, to rate her husband at his true worth. She did not understand\nthat the picture of an embodied perfection is distasteful to the\nmajority of mankind. The cause of this is not so much an envy of the\nperfect being as a suspicion that he must be inhuman; and thus it\nhappened that the public, when it saw displayed for its admiration a\nfigure resembling the sugary hero of a moral story-book rather than a\nfellow man of flesh and blood, turned away with a shrug, a smile, and\na flippant ejaculation. But in this the public was the loser as well as\nVictoria. For in truth Albert was a far more interesting personage than\nthe public dreamed. By a curious irony an impeccable waxwork had been\nfixed by the Queen's love in the popular imagination, while the creature\nwhom it represented--the real creature, so full of energy and stress\nand torment, so mysterious and so unhappy, and so fallible and so very\nhuman--had altogether disappeared.\nIV\nWords and books may be ambiguous memorials; but who can misinterpret the\nvisible solidity of bronze and stone? At Frogmore, near Windsor, where\nher mother was buried, Victoria constructed, at the cost of L200,000, a\nvast and elaborate mausoleum for herself and her husband. But that was\na private and domestic monument, and the Queen desired that wherever\nher subjects might be gathered together they should be reminded of the\nPrince. Her desire was gratified; all over the country--at Aberdeen, at\nPerth, and at Wolverhampton--statues of the Prince were erected; and\nthe Queen, making an exception to her rule of retirement, unveiled them\nherself. Nor did the capital lag behind. A month after the Prince's\ndeath a meeting was called together at the Mansion House to discuss\nschemes for honouring his memory. Opinions, however, were divided upon\nthe subject. Was a statue or an institution to be preferred? Meanwhile a\nsubscription was opened; an influential committee was appointed, and the\nQueen was consulted as to her wishes in the matter. Her Majesty replied\nthat she would prefer a granite obelisk, with sculptures at the base, to\nan institution. But the committee hesitated: an obelisk, to be worthy\nof the name, must clearly be a monolith; and where was the quarry in\nEngland capable of furnishing a granite block of the required size? It\nwas true that there was granite in Russian Finland; but the committee\nwere advised that it was not adapted to resist exposure to the open air.\nOn the whole, therefore, they suggested that a Memorial Hall should be\nerected, together with a statue of the Prince. Her Majesty assented; but\nthen another difficulty arose. It was found that not more than L60,000\nhad been subscribed--a sum insufficient to defray the double expense.\nThe Hall, therefore, was abandoned; a statue alone was to be erected;\nand certain eminent architects were asked to prepare designs. Eventually\nthe committee had at their disposal a total sum of L120,000, since\nthe public subscribed another L10,000, while L50,000 was voted by\nParliament. Some years later a joint stock company was formed and built,\nas a private speculation, the Albert Hall.",

            "text": "The architect whose design was selected, both by the committee and by\nthe Queen, was Mr. Gilbert Scott, whose industry, conscientiousness,\nand genuine piety had brought him to the head of his profession.\nHis lifelong zeal for the Gothic style having given him a special\nprominence, his handiwork was strikingly visible, not only in a\nmultitude of original buildings, but in most of the cathedrals of\nEngland. Protests, indeed, were occasionally raised against his\nrenovations; but Mr. Scott replied with such vigour and unction in\narticles and pamphlets that not a Dean was unconvinced, and he was\npermitted to continue his labours without interruption. On one occasion,\nhowever, his devotion to Gothic had placed him in an unpleasant\nsituation. The Government offices in Whitehall were to be rebuilt; Mr.\nScott competed, and his designs were successful. Naturally, they were in\nthe Gothic style, combining \"a certain squareness and horizontality of\noutline\" with pillar-mullions, gables, high-pitched roofs, and dormers;\nand the drawings, as Mr. Scott himself observed, \"were, perhaps, the\nbest ever sent in to a competition, or nearly so.\" After the usual\ndifficulties and delays the work was at last to be put in hand, when\nthere was a change of Government and Lord Palmerston became Prime\nMinister. Lord Palmerston at once sent for Mr. Scott. \"Well, Mr. Scott,\"\nhe said, in his jaunty way, \"I can't have anything to do with this\nGothic style. I must insist on your making a design in the Italian\nmanner, which I am sure you can do very cleverly.\" Mr. Scott was\nappalled; the style of the Italian renaissance was not only unsightly,\nit was positively immoral, and he sternly refused to have anything to do\nwith it. Thereupon Lord Palmerston assumed a fatherly tone. \"Quite true;\na Gothic architect can't be expected to put up a Classical building;\nI must find someone else.\" This was intolerable, and Mr. Scott, on his\nreturn home, addressed to the Prime Minister a strongly-worded letter,\nin which he dwelt upon his position as an architect, upon his having won\ntwo European competitions, his being an A.R.A., a gold medallist of the\nInstitute, and a lecturer on architecture at the Royal Academy; but it\nwas useless--Lord Palmerston did not even reply. It then occurred to\nMr. Scott that, by a judicious mixture, he might, while preserving the\nessential character of the Gothic, produce a design which would give a\nsuperficial impression of the Classical style. He did so, but no effect\nwas produced upon Lord Palmerston. The new design, he said, was \"neither\none thing nor 'tother--a regular mongrel affair--and he would have\nnothing to do with it either.\" After that Mr. Scott found it necessary\nto recruit for two months at Scarborough, \"with a course of quinine.\" He\nrecovered his tone at last, but only at the cost of his convictions. For\nthe sake of his family he felt that it was his unfortunate duty to obey\nthe Prime Minister; and, shuddering with horror, he constructed the\nGovernment offices in a strictly Renaissance style.\nShortly afterwards Mr. Scott found some consolation in building the St.\nPancras Hotel in a style of his own.\nAnd now another and yet more satisfactory task was his. \"My idea in\ndesigning the Memorial,\" he wrote, \"was to erect a kind of ciborium to\nprotect a statue of the Prince; and its special characteristic was\nthat the ciborium was designed in some degree on the principles of the\nancient shrines. These shrines were models of imaginary buildings, such\nas had never in reality been erected; and my idea was to realise one of\nthese imaginary structures with its precious materials, its inlaying,\nits enamels, etc. etc.\" His idea was particularly appropriate since\nit chanced that a similar conception, though in the reverse order of\nmagnitude, had occurred to the Prince himself, who had designed and\nexecuted several silver cruet-stands upon the same model. At the Queen's\nrequest a site was chosen in Kensington Gardens as near as possible\nto that of the Great Exhibition; and in May, 1864, the first sod was\nturned. The work was long, complicated, and difficult; a great number\nof workmen were employed, besides several subsidiary sculptors and\nmetal--workers under Mr. Scott's direction, while at every stage\nsketches and models were submitted to Her Majesty, who criticised all\nthe details with minute care, and constantly suggested improvements. The\nfrieze, which encircled the base of the monument, was in itself a very\nserious piece of work. \"This,\" said Mr. Scott, \"taken as a whole, is\nperhaps one of the most laborious works of sculpture ever undertaken,\nconsisting, as it does, of a continuous range of figure-sculpture of the\nmost elaborate description, in the highest alto-relievo of life-size, of\nmore than 200 feet in length, containing about 170 figures, and executed\nin the hardest marble which could be procured.\" After three years of\ntoil the memorial was still far from completion, and Mr. Scott thought\nit advisable to give a dinner to the workmen, \"as a substantial\nrecognition of his appreciation of their skill and energy.\" \"Two long\ntables,\" we are told, \"constructed of scaffold planks, were arranged in\nthe workshops, and covered with newspapers, for want of table-cloths.\nUpwards of eighty men sat down. Beef and mutton, plum pudding and cheese\nwere supplied in abundance, and each man who desired it had three pints\nof beer, gingerbeer and lemonade being provided for the teetotalers, who\nformed a very considerable proportion... Several toasts were given and\nmany of the workmen spoke, almost all of them commencing by 'Thanking\nGod that they enjoyed good health;' some alluded to the temperance that\nprevailed amongst them, others observed how little swearing was ever\nheard, whilst all said how pleased and proud they were to be engaged on\nso great a work.\"\nGradually the edifice approached completion. The one hundred and\nseventieth life-size figure in the frieze was chiselled, the granite\npillars arose, the mosaics were inserted in the allegorical pediments,\nthe four colossal statues representing the greater Christian virtues,\nthe four other colossal statues representing the greater moral virtues,\nwere hoisted into their positions, the eight bronzes representing the\ngreater sciences--Astronomy, Chemistry, Geology, Geometry, Rhetoric,\nMedicine, Philosophy, and Physiology--were fixed on their glittering\npinnacles, high in air. The statue of Physiology was particularly\nadmired. \"On her left arm,\" the official description informs us, \"she\nbears a new-born infant, as a representation of the development of the\nhighest and most perfect of physiological forms; her hand points\ntowards a microscope, the instrument which lends its assistance for the\ninvestigation of the minuter forms of animal and vegetable organisms.\"\nAt last the gilded cross crowned the dwindling galaxies of superimposed\nangels, the four continents in white marble stood at the four corners\nof the base, and, seven years after its inception, in July, 1872, the\nmonument was thrown open to the public.\nBut four more years were to elapse before the central figure was ready\nto be placed under its starry canopy. It was designed by Mr. Foley,\nthough in one particular the sculptor's freedom was restricted by Mr.\nScott. \"I have chosen the sitting posture,\" Mr. Scott said, \"as best\nconveying the idea of dignity befitting a royal personage.\" Mr. Foley\nably carried out the conception of his principal. \"In the attitude\nand expression,\" he said, \"the aim has been, with the individuality of\nportraiture, to embody rank, character, and enlightenment, and to convey\na sense of that responsive intelligence indicating an active, rather\nthan a passive, interest in those pursuits of civilisation illustrated\nin the surrounding figures, groups, and relievos... To identify the\nfigure with one of the most memorable undertakings of the public life\nof the Prince--the International Exhibition of 1851--a catalogue of the\nworks collected in that first gathering of the industry of all nations,\nis placed in the right hand.\" The statue was of bronze gilt and weighed\nnearly ten tons. It was rightly supposed that the simple word \"Albert,\"\ncast on the base, would be a sufficient means of identification.\nCHAPTER",

A new scene opened; and\nnew protagonists--Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli--struggled together\nin the limelight. Victoria, from her post of vantage, watched these\ndevelopments with that passionate and personal interest which she\ninvariably imported into politics. Her prepossessions were of an\nunexpected kind. Mr. Gladstone had been the disciple of her revered\nPeel, and had won the approval of Albert; Mr. Disraeli had hounded Sir\nRobert to his fall with hideous virulence, and the Prince had pronounced\nthat he \"had not one single element of a gentleman in his composition.\"\nYet she regarded Mr. Gladstone with a distrust and dislike which\nsteadily deepened, while upon his rival she lavished an abundance of\nconfidence, esteem, and affection such as Lord Melbourne himself had\nhardly known.\nHer attitude towards the Tory Minister had suddenly changed when\nshe found that he alone among public men had divined her feelings at\nAlbert's death. Of the others she might have said \"they pity me and not\nmy grief;\" but Mr. Disraeli had understood; and all his condolences\nhad taken the form of reverential eulogies of the departed. The Queen\ndeclared that he was \"the only person who appreciated the Prince.\"\nShe began to show him special favour; gave him and his wife two of the\ncoveted seats in St. George's Chapel at the Prince of Wales's wedding,\nand invited him to stay a night at Windsor. When the grant for the\nAlbert Memorial came before the House of Commons, Disraeli, as leader of\nthe Opposition, eloquently supported the project. He was rewarded by\na copy of the Prince's speeches, bound in white morocco, with an\ninscription in the royal hand. In his letter of thanks he \"ventured\nto touch upon a sacred theme,\" and, in a strain which re-echoed with\nmasterly fidelity the sentiments of his correspondent, dwelt at length\nupon the absolute perfection of Albert. \"The Prince,\" he said, \"is the\nonly person whom Mr. Disraeli has ever known who realised the Ideal.\nNone with whom he is acquainted have ever approached it. There was in\nhim a union of the manly grace and sublime simplicity, of chivalry with\nthe intellectual splendour of the Attic Academe. The only character in\nEnglish history that would, in some respects, draw near to him is Sir\nPhilip Sidney: the same high tone, the same universal accomplishments,\nthe same blended tenderness and vigour, the same rare combination of\nromantic energy and classic repose.\" As for his own acquaintance\nwith the Prince, it had been, he said, \"one of the most satisfactory\nincidents of his life: full of refined and beautiful memories, and\nexercising, as he hopes, over his remaining existence, a soothing\nand exalting influence.\" Victoria was much affected by \"the depth and\ndelicacy of these touches,\" and henceforward Disraeli's place in her\naffections was assured. When, in 1866, the Conservatives came into\noffice, Disraeli's position as Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader\nof the House necessarily brought him into a closer relation with the\nSovereign. Two years later Lord Derby resigned, and Victoria, with\nintense delight and peculiar graciousness, welcomed Disraeli as her\nFirst Minister.\nBut only for nine agitated months did he remain in power. The Ministry,\nin a minority in the Commons, was swept out of existence by a general\nelection. Yet by the end of that short period the ties which bound\ntogether the Queen and her Premier had grown far stronger than ever\nbefore; the relationship between them was now no longer merely that",

For a moment she hoped that the House of Lords would come to\nthe rescue; the Peers opposed the change with unexpected vigour; but Mr.\nGladstone, more conscious than ever of the support of the Almighty, was\nready with an ingenious device. The purchase of commissions had been\noriginally allowed by Royal Warrant; it should now be disallowed by the\nsame agency. Victoria was faced by a curious dilemma: she abominated the\nabolition of purchase; but she was asked to abolish it by an exercise of\nsovereign power which was very much to her taste. She did not hesitate\nfor long; and when the Cabinet, in a formal minute, advised her to sign\nthe Warrant, she did so with a good grace.\nUnacceptable as Mr. Gladstone's policy was, there was something else\nabout him which was even more displeasing to Victoria. She disliked his\npersonal demeanour towards herself. It was not that Mr. Gladstone,\nin his intercourse with her, was in any degree lacking in courtesy or\nrespect. On the contrary, an extraordinary reverence impregnated\nhis manner, both in his conversation and his correspondence with the\nSovereign. Indeed, with that deep and passionate conservatism which, to\nthe very end of his incredible career, gave such an unexpected colouring\nto his inexplicable character, Mr. Gladstone viewed Victoria through a\nhaze of awe which was almost religious--as a sacrosanct embodiment of\nvenerable traditions--a vital element in the British Constitution--a\nQueen by Act of Parliament. But unfortunately the lady did not\nappreciate the compliment. The well-known complaint--\"He speaks to me\nas if I were a public meeting-\" whether authentic or no--and the turn\nof the sentence is surely a little too epigrammatic to be genuinely\nVictorian--undoubtedly expresses the essential element of her antipathy.\nShe had no objection to being considered as an institution; she was one,\nand she knew it. But she was a woman too, and to be considered ONLY as\nan institution--that was unbearable. And thus all Mr. Gladstone's zeal\nand devotion, his ceremonious phrases, his low bows, his punctilious\ncorrectitudes, were utterly wasted; and when, in the excess of his\nloyalty, he went further, and imputed to the object of his veneration,\nwith obsequious blindness, the subtlety of intellect, the wide reading,\nthe grave enthusiasm, which he himself possessed, the misunderstanding\nbecame complete. The discordance between the actual Victoria and this\nstrange Divinity made in Mr. Gladstone's image produced disastrous\nresults. Her discomfort and dislike turned at last into positive\nanimosity, and, though her manners continued to be perfect, she\nnever for a moment unbent; while he on his side was overcome with",

            "text": "disappointment, perplexity, and mortification.\nYet his fidelity remained unshaken. When the Cabinet met, the Prime\nMinister, filled with his beatific vision, would open the proceedings by\nreading aloud the letters which he had received from the Queen upon the\nquestions of the hour. The assembly sat in absolute silence while,\none after another, the royal missives, with their emphases, their\nejaculations, and their grammatical peculiarities, boomed forth in all\nthe deep solemnity of Mr. Gladstone's utterance. Not a single comment,\nof any kind, was ever hazarded; and, after a fitting pause, the Cabinet\nproceeded with the business of the day.\nII\nLittle as Victoria appreciated her Prime Minister's attitude towards\nher, she found that it had its uses. The popular discontent at her\nuninterrupted seclusion had been gathering force for many years, and\nnow burst out in a new and alarming shape. Republicanism was in the air.\nRadical opinion in England, stimulated by the fall of Napoleon III and\nthe establishment of a republican government in France, suddenly grew\nmore extreme than it ever had been since 1848. It also became for the\nfirst time almost respectable. Chartism had been entirely an affair of\nthe lower classes; but now Members of Parliament, learned professors,\nand ladies of title openly avowed the most subversive views. The\nmonarchy was attacked both in theory and in practice. And it was\nattacked at a vital point: it was declared to be too expensive. What\nbenefits, it was asked, did the nation reap to counterbalance the\nenormous sums which were expended upon the Sovereign? Victoria's\nretirement gave an unpleasant handle to the argument. It was pointed out\nthat the ceremonial functions of the Crown had virtually lapsed; and the\nawkward question remained whether any of the other functions which it\ndid continue to perform were really worth L385,000 per annum. The royal\nbalance-sheet was curiously examined. An anonymous pamphlet entitled\n\"What does she do with it?\" appeared, setting forth the financial\nposition with malicious clarity. The Queen, it stated, was granted by\nthe Civil List L60,000 a year for her private use; but the rest of her\nvast annuity was given, as the Act declared, to enable her \"to defray\nthe expenses of her royal household and to support the honour and\ndignity of the Crown.\" Now it was obvious that, since the death of the\nPrince, the expenditure for both these purposes must have been very\nconsiderably diminished, and it was difficult to resist the conclusion\nthat a large sum of money was diverted annually from the uses for which\nit had been designed by Parliament, to swell the private fortune of\nVictoria. The precise amount of that private fortune it was impossible\nto discover; but there was reason to suppose that it was gigantic;\nperhaps it reached a total of five million pounds. The pamphlet\nprotested against such a state of affairs, and its protests were\nrepeated vigorously in newspapers and at public meetings. Though it is\ncertain that the estimate of Victoria's riches was much exaggerated,\nit is equally certain that she was an exceedingly wealthy woman. She\nprobably saved L20,000 a year from the Civil List, the revenues of\nthe Duchy of Lancaster were steadily increasing, she had inherited a\nconsiderable property from the Prince Consort, and she had been left, in\n1852, an estate of half a million by Mr. John Neild, an eccentric\nmiser. In these circumstances it was not surprising that when, in 1871,\nParliament was asked to vote a dowry of L30,000 to the Princess Louise\non her marriage with the eldest son of the Duke of Argyle, together with\nan annuity of L6,000, there should have been a serious outcry(*).\n(*) In 1889 it was officially stated that the Queen's total\nsavings from the Civil List amounted to L824,025, but that\nout of this sum much had been spent on special\nentertainments to foreign visitors. Taking into\nconsideration the proceeds from the Duchy of Lancaster,\nwhich were more than L60,000 a year, the savings of the\nPrince Consort, and Mr. Neild's legacy, it seems probable\nthat, at the time of her death, Victoria's private fortune\napproached two million pounds.\nIn order to conciliate public opinion, the Queen opened Parliament in\nperson, and the vote was passed almost unanimously. But a few months\nlater another demand was made: the Prince Arthur had come of age, and\nthe nation was asked to grant him an annuity of L15,000. The outcry was\nredoubled. The newspapers were filled with angry articles; Bradlaugh\nthundered against \"princely paupers\" to one of the largest crowds that\nhad ever been seen in Trafalgar Square; and Sir Charles Dilke expounded\nthe case for a republic in a speech to his constituents at Newcastle.\nThe Prince's annuity was ultimately sanctioned in the House of Commons\nby a large majority; but a minority of fifty members voted in favour of\nreducing the sum to L10,000.\nTowards every aspect of this distasteful question, Mr. Gladstone\npresented an iron front. He absolutely discountenanced the extreme\nsection of his followers. He declared that the whole of the Queen's\nincome was justly at her personal disposal, argued that to complain\nof royal savings was merely to encourage royal extravagance, and\nsuccessfully convoyed through Parliament the unpopular annuities, which,\nhe pointed out, were strictly in accordance with precedent. When, in\n1872, Sir Charles Dilke once more returned to the charge in the House\nof Commons, introducing a motion for a full enquiry into the Queen's\nexpenditure with a view to a root and branch reform of the Civil\nList, the Prime Minister brought all the resources of his powerful\nand ingenious eloquence to the support of the Crown. He was completely\nsuccessful; and amid a scene of great disorder the motion was\nignominiously dismissed. Victoria was relieved; but she grew no fonder\nof Mr. Gladstone.\nIt was perhaps the most miserable moment of her life. The Ministers,\nthe press, the public, all conspired to vex her, to blame her, to\nmisinterpret her actions, to be unsympathetic and disrespectful in\nevery way. She was \"a cruelly misunderstood woman,\" she told Mr. Martin,\ncomplaining to him bitterly of the unjust attacks which were made upon\nher, and declaring that \"the great worry and anxiety and hard work for\nten years, alone, unaided, with increasing age and never very strong\nhealth\" were breaking her down, and \"almost drove her to despair.\" The\nsituation was indeed deplorable. It seemed as if her whole existence\nhad gone awry; as if an irremediable antagonism had grown up between the\nQueen and the nation. If Victoria had died in the early seventies, there\ncan be little doubt that the voice of the world would have pronounced\nher a failure.",

            "text": "Then there followed six years of excitement, of enchantment, of\nfelicity, of glory, of romance. The amazing being, who now at last, at\nthe age of seventy, after a lifetime of extraordinary struggles, had\nturned into reality the absurdest of his boyhood's dreams, knew well\nenough how to make his own, with absolute completeness, the heart of the\nSovereign Lady whose servant, and whose master, he had so miraculously\nbecome. In women's hearts he had always read as in an open book. His\nwhole career had turned upon those curious entities; and the more\ncurious they were, the more intimately at home with them he seemed\nto be. But Lady Beaconsfield, with her cracked idolatry, and Mrs.\nBrydges-Williams, with her clogs, her corpulence, and her legacy,\nwere gone: an even more remarkable phenomenon stood in their place. He\nsurveyed what was before him with the eye of a past-master; and he was\nnot for a moment at a loss. He realised everything--the interacting\ncomplexities of circumstance and character, the pride of place mingled\nso inextricably with personal arrogance, the superabundant emotionalism,\nthe ingenuousness of outlook, the solid, the laborious respectability,\nshot through so incongruously by temperamental cravings for the\ncoloured and the strange, the singular intellectual limitations, and the\nmysteriously essential female elements impregnating every particle of\nthe whole. A smile hovered over his impassive features, and he\ndubbed Victoria \"the Faery.\" The name delighted him, for, with that\nepigrammatic ambiguity so dear to his heart, it precisely expressed\nhis vision of the Queen. The Spenserian allusion was very pleasant--the\nelegant evocations of Gloriana; but there was more in it than that:\nthere was the suggestion of a diminutive creature, endowed with\nmagical--and mythical--properties, and a portentousness almost\nridiculously out of keeping with the rest of her make-up. The Faery, he\ndetermined, should henceforward wave her wand for him alone. Detachment\nis always a rare quality, and rarest of all, perhaps, among politicians;\nbut that veteran egotist possessed it in a supreme degree. Not only did\nhe know what he had to do, not only did he do it; he was in the audience\nas well as on the stage; and he took in with the rich relish of a\nconnoisseur every feature of the entertaining situation, every phase of\nthe delicate drama, and every detail of his own consummate performance.\nThe smile hovered and vanished, and, bowing low with Oriental gravity\nand Oriental submissiveness, he set himself to his task. He had\nunderstood from the first that in dealing with the Faery the appropriate\nmethod of approach was the very antithesis of the Gladstonian; and such\na method was naturally his. It was not his habit to harangue and exhort\nand expatiate in official conscientiousness; he liked to scatter flowers\nalong the path of business, to compress a weighty argument into a happy\nphrase, to insinuate what was in his mind with an air of friendship\nand confidential courtesy. He was nothing if not personal; and he had\nperceived that personality was the key that opened the Faery's heart.\nAccordingly, he never for a moment allowed his intercourse with her to\nlose the personal tone; he invested all the transactions of State with\nthe charms of familiar conversation; she was always the royal lady, the\nadored and revered mistress, he the devoted and respectful friend. When\nonce the personal relation was firmly established, every difficulty\ndisappeared. But to maintain that relation uninterruptedly in a smooth\nand even course a particular care was necessary: the bearings had to be\nmost assiduously oiled. Nor was Disraeli in any doubt as to the nature\nof the lubricant. \"You have heard me called a flatterer,\" he said to\nMatthew Arnold, \"and it is true. Everyone likes flattery, and when you\ncome to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.\" He practiced what\nhe preached. His adulation was incessant, and he applied it in the very\nthickest slabs. \"There is no honor and no reward,\" he declared, \"that\nwith him can ever equal the possession of your Majesty's kind thoughts.\nAll his own thoughts and feelings and duties and affections are now\nconcentrated in your Majesty, and he desires nothing more for his\nremaining years than to serve your Majesty, or, if that service\nceases, to live still on its memory as a period of his existence most\ninteresting and fascinating.\" \"In life,\" he told her, \"one must have for\none's thoughts a sacred depository, and Lord Beaconsfield ever presumes\nto seek that in his Sovereign Mistress.\" She was not only his own\nsolitary support; she was the one prop of the State. \"If your Majesty\nis ill,\" he wrote during a grave political crisis, \"he is sure he will\nhimself break down. All, really, depends upon your Majesty.\" \"He lives\nonly for Her,\" he asseverated, \"and works only for Her, and without Her\nall is lost.\" When her birthday came he produced an elaborate confection\nof hyperbolic compliment. \"To-day Lord Beaconsfield ought fitly,\nperhaps, to congratulate a powerful Sovereign on her imperial sway, the\nvastness of her Empire, and the success and strength of her fleets and\narmies. But he cannot, his mind is in another mood. He can only think of\nthe strangeness of his destiny that it has come to pass that he should\nbe the servant of one so great, and whose infinite kindness, the\nbrightness of whose intelligence and the firmness of whose will, have\nenabled him to undertake labours to which he otherwise would be quite\nunequal, and supported him in all things by a condescending sympathy,\nwhich in the hour of difficulty alike charms and inspires. Upon the\nSovereign of many lands and many hearts may an omnipotent Providence\nshed every blessing that the wise can desire and the virtuous deserve!\"\nIn those expert hands the trowel seemed to assume the qualities of\nsome lofty masonic symbol--to be the ornate and glittering vehicle of\nverities unrealised by the profane.\nSuch tributes were delightful, but they remained in the nebulous region\nof words, and Disraeli had determined to give his blandishments a more\nsignificant solidity. He deliberately encouraged those high views of\nher own position which had always been native to Victoria's mind and\nhad been reinforced by the principles of Albert and the doctrines of\nStockmar. He professed to a belief in a theory of the Constitution which\ngave the Sovereign a leading place in the councils of government;\nbut his pronouncements upon the subject were indistinct; and when he\nemphatically declared that there ought to be \"a real Throne,\" it was\nprobably with the mental addition that that throne would be a very\nunreal one indeed whose occupant was unamenable to his cajoleries.\nBut the vagueness of his language was in itself an added stimulant to\nVictoria. Skilfully confusing the woman and the Queen, he threw, with a\ngrandiose gesture, the government of England at her feet, as if in doing\nso he were performing an act of personal homage. In his first audience\nafter returning to power, he assured her that \"whatever she wished\nshould be done.\" When the intricate Public Worship Regulation Bill was\nbeing discussed by the Cabinet, he told the Faery that his \"only object\"\nwas \"to further your Majesty's wishes in this matter.\" When he brought\noff his great coup over the Suez Canal, he used expressions which\nimplied that the only gainer by the transaction was Victoria. \"It is\njust settled,\" he wrote in triumph; \"you have it, Madam... Four millions\nsterling! and almost immediately. There was only one firm that could\ndo it--Rothschilds. They behaved admirably; advanced the money at a low\nrate, and the entire interest of the Khedive is now yours, Madam.\" Nor\ndid he limit himself to highly-spiced insinuations. Writing with all\nthe authority of his office, he advised the Queen that she had the\nconstitutional right to dismiss a Ministry which was supported by a\nlarge majority in the House of Commons, he even urged her to do so, if,\nin her opinion, \"your Majesty's Government have from wilfulness, or even\nfrom weakness, deceived your Majesty.\" To the horror of Mr. Gladstone,\nhe not only kept the Queen informed as to the general course of business\nin the Cabinet, but revealed to her the part taken in its discussions by\nindividual members of it. Lord Derby, the son of the late Prime Minister\nand Disraeli's Foreign Secretary, viewed these developments with grave\nmistrust. \"Is there not,\" he ventured to write to his Chief, \"just a\nrisk of encouraging her in too large ideas of her personal power, and\ntoo great indifference to what the public expects? I only ask; it is for\nyou to judge.\"\nAs for Victoria, she accepted everything--compliments, flatteries,\nElizabethan prerogatives--without a single qualm. After the long gloom\nof her bereavement, after the chill of the Gladstonian discipline, she\nexpanded to the rays of Disraeli's devotion like a flower in the sun.\nThe change in her situation was indeed miraculous. No longer was she\nobliged to puzzle for hours over the complicated details of business,\nfor now she had only to ask Mr. Disraeli for an explanation, and he\nwould give it her in the most concise, in the most amusing, way. No\nlonger was she worried by alarming novelties; no longer was she put out\nat finding herself treated, by a reverential gentleman in high collars,\nas if she were some embodied precedent, with a recondite knowledge of\nGreek. And her deliverer was surely the most fascinating of men. The\nstrain of charlatanism, which had unconsciously captivated her in\nNapoleon III, exercised the same enchanting effect in the case of\nDisraeli. Like a dram-drinker, whose ordinary life is passed in dull\nsobriety, her unsophisticated intelligence gulped down his rococo\nallurements with peculiar zest. She became intoxicated, entranced.\nBelieving all that he told her of herself, she completely regained the\nself-confidence which had been slipping away from her throughout\nthe dark period that followed Albert's death. She swelled with a new\nelation, while he, conjuring up before her wonderful Oriental visions,\ndazzled her eyes with an imperial grandeur of which she had only dimly\ndreamed. Under the compelling influence, her very demeanour altered.\nHer short, stout figure, with its folds of black velvet, its muslin\nstreamers, its heavy pearls at the heavy neck, assumed an almost\nmenacing air. In her countenance, from which the charm of youth had long\nsince vanished, and which had not yet been softened by age, the traces\nof grief, of disappointment, and of displeasure were still visible, but\nthey were overlaid by looks of arrogance and sharp lines of peremptory\nhauteur. Only, when Mr. Disraeli appeared, the expression changed in an\ninstant, and the forbidding visage became charged with smiles. For him\nshe would do anything. Yielding to his encouragements, she began to\nemerge from her seclusion; she appeared in London in semi-state, at\nhospitals and concerts; she opened Parliament; she reviewed troops and\ndistributed medals at Aldershot. But such public signs of favour were",

She was\nwreathed with smiles, and, as she tattled, glided about the room like\na bird.\" In his absence, she talked of him perpetually, and there was\na note of unusual vehemence in her solicitude for his health. \"John\nManners,\" Disraeli told Lady Bradford, \"who has just come from Osborne,\nsays that the Faery only talked of one subject, and that was her Primo.\nAccording to him, it was her gracious opinion that the Government should\nmake my health a Cabinet question. Dear John seemed quite surprised at\nwhat she said; but you are used to these ebullitions.\" She often sent\nhim presents; an illustrated album arrived for him regularly from\nWindsor on Christmas Day. But her most valued gifts were the bunches of\nspring flowers which, gathered by herself and her ladies in the woods at\nOsborne, marked in an especial manner the warmth and tenderness of her\nsentiments. Among these it was, he declared, the primroses that he loved\nthe best. They were, he said, \"the ambassadors of Spring, the gems and\njewels of Nature.\" He liked them, he assured her, \"so much better for\ntheir being wild; they seem an offering from the Fauns and Dryads of\nOsborne.\" \"They show,\" he told her, \"that your Majesty's sceptre has\ntouched the enchanted Isle.\" He sat at dinner with heaped-up bowls of\nthem on every side, and told his guests that \"they were all sent to me\nthis morning by the Queen from Osborne, as she knows it is my favorite\nflower.\"\nAs time went on, and as it became clearer and clearer that the\nFaery's thraldom was complete, his protestations grew steadily more\nhighly--coloured and more unabashed. At last he ventured to import\ninto his blandishments a strain of adoration that was almost avowedly\nromantic. In phrases of baroque convolution, he conveyed the message\nof his heart. \"The pressure of business,\" he wrote, had \"so absorbed and\nexhausted him, that towards the hour of post he has not had clearness\nof mind, and vigour of pen, adequate to convey his thoughts and facts to\nthe most loved and illustrious being, who deigns to consider them.\" She\nsent him some primroses, and he replied that he could \"truly say they\nare 'more precious than rubies,' coming, as they do, and at such a\nmoment, from a Sovereign whom he adores.\" She sent him snowdrops, and\nhis sentiment overflowed into poetry. \"Yesterday eve,\" he wrote, \"there\nappeared, in Whitehall Gardens, a delicate-looking case, with a royal\nsuperscription, which, when he opened, he thought, at first, that your\nMajesty had graciously bestowed upon him the stars of your Majesty's\nprincipal orders.\" And, indeed, he was so impressed with this graceful\nillusion, that, having a banquet, where there were many stars and\nribbons, he could not resist the temptation, by placing some snowdrops\non his heart, of showing that, he, too, was decorated by a gracious\nSovereign.\nThen, in the middle of the night, it occurred to him, that it might all\nbe an enchantment, and that, perhaps, it was a Faery gift and came from\nanother monarch: Queen Titania, gathering flowers, with her Court, in",

Perhaps; and yet\nit would be rash to conclude that his perfervid declarations were\naltogether without sincerity. Actor and spectator both, the two\ncharacters were so intimately blended together in that odd composition\nthat they formed an inseparable unity, and it was impossible to say that\none of them was less genuine than the other. With one element, he\ncould coldly appraise the Faery's intellectual capacity, note with some\nsurprise that she could be on occasion \"most interesting and amusing,\"\nand then continue his use of the trowel with an ironical solemnity;\nwhile, with the other, he could be overwhelmed by the immemorial panoply\nof royalty, and, thrilling with the sense of his own strange elevation,\ndream himself into a gorgeous phantasy of crowns and powers and\nchivalric love. When he told Victoria that \"during a somewhat romantic\nand imaginative life, nothing has ever occurred to him so interesting as\nthis confidential correspondence with one so exalted and so inspiring,\"\nwas he not in earnest after all? When he wrote to a lady about the\nCourt, \"I love the Queen--perhaps the only person in this world left to\nme that I do love,\" was he not creating for himself an enchanted palace\nout of the Arabian Nights, full of melancholy and spangles, in which\nhe actually believed? Victoria's state of mind was far more simple;\nuntroubled by imaginative yearnings, she never lost herself in that\nnebulous region of the spirit where feeling and fancy grow confused. Her\nemotions, with all their intensity and all their exaggeration, retained\nthe plain prosaic texture of everyday life. And it was fitting that her\nexpression of them should be equally commonplace. She was, she told her\nPrime Minister, at the end of an official letter, \"yours aff'ly V. R.\nand I.\" In such a phrase the deep reality of her feeling is instantly\nmanifest. The Faery's feet were on the solid earth; it was the ruse\ncynic who was in the air.\nHe had taught her, however, a lesson, which she had learnt with alarming\nrapidity. A second Gloriana, did he call her? Very well, then, she would\nshow that she deserved the compliment. Disquieting symptoms followed\nfast. In May, 1874, the Tsar, whose daughter had just been married to\nVictoria's second son, the Duke of Edinburgh, was in London, and, by an\nunfortunate error, it had been arranged that his departure should not\ntake place until two days after the date on which his royal hostess had\npreviously decided to go to Balmoral. Her Majesty refused to modify\nher plans. It was pointed out to her that the Tsar would certainly be\noffended, that the most serious consequences might follow; Lord Derby\nprotested; Lord Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, was much\nperturbed. But the Faery was unconcerned; she had settled to go to\nBalmoral on the 18th, and on the 18th she would go. At last Disraeli,\nexercising all his influence, induced her to agree to stay in London\nfor two days more. \"My head is still on my shoulders,\" he told Lady\nBradford. \"The great lady has absolutely postponed her departure!\nEverybody had failed, even the Prince of Wales... and I have no doubt I\nam not in favour. I can't help it. Salisbury says I have saved an Afghan\nWar, and Derby compliments me on my unrivalled triumph.\" But before very\nlong, on another issue, the triumph was the Faery's. Disraeli, who had\nsuddenly veered towards a new Imperialism, had thrown out the suggestion\nthat the Queen of England ought to become the Empress of India. Victoria\nseized upon the idea with avidity, and, in season and out of season,\npressed upon her Prime Minister the desirability of putting his proposal\ninto practice. He demurred; but she was not to be baulked; and in 1876,\nin spite of his own unwillingness and that of his entire Cabinet, he\nfound himself obliged to add to the troubles of a stormy session\nby introducing a bill for the alteration of the Royal Title. His\ncompliance, however, finally conquered the Faery's heart. The measure\nwas angrily attacked in both Houses, and Victoria was deeply touched by\nthe untiring energy with which Disraeli defended it. She was, she said,\nmuch grieved by \"the worry and annoyance\" to which he was subjected; she\nfeared she was the cause of it; and she would never forget what she owed\nto \"her kind, good, and considerate friend.\" At the same time, her wrath\nfell on the Opposition. Their conduct, she declared, was \"extraordinary,\nincomprehensible, and mistaken,\" and, in an emphatic sentence which\nseemed to contradict both itself and all her former proceedings, she\nprotested that she \"would be glad if it were more generally known that\nit was HER wish, as people WILL have it, that it has been FORCED UPON\nHER!\" When the affair was successfully over, the imperial triumph was\ncelebrated in a suitable manner. On the day of the Delhi Proclamation,\nthe new Earl of Beaconsfield went to Windsor to dine with the new\nEmpress of India. That night the Faery, usually so homely in her attire,\nappeared in a glittering panoply of enormous uncut jewels, which had\nbeen presented to her by the reigning Princes of her Raj. At the end of\nthe meal the Prime Minister, breaking through the rules of\netiquette, arose, and in a flowery oration proposed the health of\nthe Queen-Empress. His audacity was well received, and his speech was\nrewarded by a smiling curtsey.\nThese were significant episodes; but a still more serious manifestation\nof Victoria's temper occurred in the following year, during the crowning\ncrisis of Beaconsfield's life. His growing imperialism, his desire\nto magnify the power and prestige of England, his insistence upon a\n\"spirited foreign policy,\" had brought him into collision with Russia;\nthe terrible Eastern Question loomed up; and when war broke out between\nRussia and Turkey, the gravity of the situation became extreme.\nThe Prime Minister's policy was fraught with difficulty and danger.\nRealising perfectly the appalling implications of an Anglo-Russian war,\nhe was yet prepared to face even that eventuality if he could obtain\nhis ends by no other method; but he believed that Russia in reality was\nstill less desirous of a rupture, and that, if he played his game with\nsufficient boldness and adroitness, she would yield, when it came to the\npoint, all that he required without a blow. It was clear that the\ncourse he had marked out for himself was full of hazard, and demanded\nan extraordinary nerve; a single false step, and either himself, or\nEngland, might be plunged in disaster. But nerve he had never lacked;\nhe began his diplomatic egg-dance with high assurance; and then he\ndiscovered that, besides the Russian Government, besides the Liberals\nand Mr. Gladstone, there were two additional sources of perilous\nembarrassment with which he would have to reckon. In the first place\nthere was a strong party in the Cabinet, headed by Lord Derby, the\nForeign Secretary, which was unwilling to take the risk of war; but his\nculminating anxiety was the Faery.\nFrom the first, her attitude was uncompromising. The old hatred of\nRussia, which had been engendered by the Crimean War, surged up again\nwithin her; she remembered Albert's prolonged animosity; she felt the\nprickings of her own greatness; and she flung herself into the turmoil\nwith passionate heat. Her indignation with the Opposition--with anyone\nwho ventured to sympathise with the Russians in their quarrel with the\nTurks--was unbounded. When anti-Turkish meetings were held in London,\npresided over by the Duke of Westminster and Lord Shaftesbury, and\nattended by Mr. Gladstone and other prominent Radicals, she considered\nthat \"the Attorney-General ought to be set at these men;\" \"it can't,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"be constitutional.\" Never in her life, not even in the\ncrisis over the Ladies of the Bedchamber, did she show herself a more\nfurious partisan. But her displeasure was not reserved for the Radicals;\nthe backsliding Conservatives equally felt its force. She was even\ndiscontented with Lord Beaconsfield himself. Failing entirely to\nappreciate the delicate complexity of his policy, she constantly\nassailed him with demands for vigorous action, interpreted each finesse\nas a sign of weakness, and was ready at every juncture to let slip the\ndogs of war. As the situation developed, her anxiety grew feverish. \"The\nQueen,\" she wrote, \"is feeling terribly anxious lest delay should cause\nus to be too late and lose our prestige for ever! It worries her night\nand day.\" \"The Faery,\" Beaconsfield told Lady Bradford, \"writes every\nday and telegraphs every hour; this is almost literally the case.\" She\nraged loudly against the Russians. \"And the language,\" she cried,\n\"the insulting language--used by the Russians against us! It makes the\nQueen's blood boil!\" \"Oh,\" she wrote a little later, \"if the Queen were\na man, she would like to go and give those Russians, whose word one\ncannot believe, such a beating! We shall never be friends again till we\nhave it out. This the Queen feels sure of.\"\nThe unfortunate Prime Minister, urged on to violence by Victoria on\none side, had to deal, on the other, with a Foreign Secretary who was\nfundamentally opposed to any policy of active interference at all.\nBetween the Queen and Lord Derby he held a harassed course. He gained,\nindeed, some slight satisfaction in playing on the one against the\nother--in stimulating Lord Derby with the Queen's missives, and in\nappeasing the Queen by repudiating Lord Derby's opinions; on one\noccasion he actually went so far as to compose, at Victoria's request,\na letter bitterly attacking his colleague, which Her Majesty forthwith\nsigned, and sent, without alteration, to the Foreign Secretary. But such\ndevices only gave a temporary relief; and it soon became evident that\nVictoria's martial ardour was not to be sidetracked by hostilities\nagainst Lord Derby; hostilities against Russia were what she wanted,\nwhat she would, what she must, have. For now, casting aside the last\nrelics of moderation, she began to attack her friend with a series of\nextraordinary threats. Not once, not twice, but many times she held over\nhis head the formidable menace of her imminent abdication. \"If England,\"\nshe wrote to Beaconsfield, \"is to kiss Russia's feet, she will not be a\nparty to the humiliation of England and would lay down her crown,\" and\nshe added that the Prime Minister might, if he thought fit, repeat her\nwords to the Cabinet. \"This delay,\" she ejaculated, \"this uncertainty by\nwhich, abroad, we are losing our prestige and our position, while Russia\nis advancing and will be before Constantinople in no time! Then the\nGovernment will be fearfully blamed and the Queen so humiliated that\nshe thinks she would abdicate at once. Be bold!\" \"She feels,\" she\nreiterated, \"she cannot, as she before said, remain the Sovereign of\na country that is letting itself down to kiss the feet of the great\nbarbarians, the retarders of all liberty and civilisation that exists.\"",

This was no longer the\nFaery; it was a genie whom he had rashly called out of her bottle, and\nwho was now intent upon showing her supernal power. More than once,\nperplexed, dispirited, shattered by illness, he had thoughts of\nwithdrawing altogether from the game. One thing alone, he told Lady\nBradford, with a wry smile, prevented him. \"If I could only,\" he wrote,\n\"face the scene which would occur at headquarters if I resigned, I would\ndo so at once.\"\nHe held on, however, to emerge victorious at last. The Queen was\npacified; Lord Derby was replaced by Lord Salisbury; and at the Congress\nof Berlin der alte Jude carried all before him. He returned to England\nin triumph, and assured the delighted Victoria that she would very soon\nbe, if she was not already, the \"Dictatress of Europe.\"\nBut soon there was an unexpected reverse. At the General Election\nof 1880 the country, mistrustful of the forward policy of the\nConservatives, and carried away by Mr. Gladstone's oratory, returned the\nLiberals to power. Victoria was horrified, but within a year she was to\nbe yet more nearly hit. The grand romance had come to its conclusion.\nLord Beaconsfield, worn out with age and maladies, but moving still, an\nassiduous mummy, from dinner-party to dinner-party, suddenly moved no\nlonger. When she knew that the end was inevitable, she seemed, by a\npathetic instinct, to divest herself of her royalty, and to shrink, with\nhushed gentleness, beside him, a woman and nothing more. \"I send some\nOsborne primroses,\" she wrote to him with touching simplicity, \"and I\nmeant to pay you a little visit this week, but I thought it better you\nshould be quite quiet and not speak. And I beg you will be very good and\nobey the doctors.\" She would see him, she said, \"when we, come back from\nOsborne, which won't be long.\" \"Everyone is so distressed at your not\nbeing well,\" she added; and she was, \"Ever yours very aff'ly V.R.I.\"\nWhen the royal letter was given him, the strange old comedian, stretched\non his bed of death, poised it in his hand, appeared to consider deeply,\nand then whispered to those about him, \"This ought to be read to me by a\nPrivy Councillor.\"\nCHAPTER",

With the marriages of her elder children her family\ncircle widened; grandchildren appeared; and a multitude of new domestic\ninterests sprang up. The death of King Leopold in 1865 had removed the\npredominant figure of the older generation, and the functions he had\nperformed as the centre and adviser of a large group of relatives in\nGermany and in England devolved upon Victoria. These functions\nshe discharged with unremitting industry, carrying on an enormous\ncorrespondence, and following with absorbed interest every detail in the\nlives of the ever-ramifying cousinhood. And she tasted to the full\nboth the joys and the pains of family affection. She took a particular\ndelight in her grandchildren, to whom she showed an indulgence which\ntheir parents had not always enjoyed, though, even to her grandchildren,\nshe could be, when the occasion demanded it, severe. The eldest of them,\nthe little Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, was a remarkably headstrong child;\nhe dared to be impertinent even to his grandmother; and once, when she\ntold him to bow to a visitor at Osborne, he disobeyed her outright.\nThis would not do: the order was sternly repeated, and the naughty boy,\nnoticing that his grandmama had suddenly turned into a most terrifying\nlady, submitted his will to hers, and bowed very low indeed.\nIt would have been well if all the Queen's domestic troubles could\nhave been got over as easily. Among her more serious distresses was the\nconduct of the Prince of Wales. The young man was now independent and\nmarried; he had shaken the parental yoke from his shoulders; he was\npositively beginning to do as he liked. Victoria was much perturbed,\nand her worst fears seemed to be justified when in 1870 he appeared as\na witness in a society divorce case. It was clear that the heir to the\nthrone had been mixing with people of whom she did not at all approve.\nWhat was to be done? She saw that it was not only her son that was to\nblame--that it was the whole system of society; and so she despatched\na letter to Mr. Delane, the editor of The Times, asking him if he would\n\"frequently WRITE articles pointing out the IMMENSE danger and evil of\nthe wretched frivolity and levity of the views and lives of the Higher\nClasses.\" And five years later Mr. Delane did write an article upon that\nvery subject. Yet it seemed to have very little effect.",

For more and more\ndid she find solace and refreshment in her Highland domain; and twice\nyearly, in the spring and in the autumn, with a sigh of relief, she set\nher face northwards, in spite of the humble protests of Ministers, who\nmurmured vainly in the royal ears that to transact the affairs of State\nover an interval of six hundred miles added considerably to the cares\nof government. Her ladies, too, felt occasionally a slight reluctance to\nset out, for, especially in the early days, the long pilgrimage was not\nwithout its drawbacks. For many years the Queen's conservatism forbade\nthe continuation of the railway up Deeside, so that the last stages\nof the journey had to be accomplished in carriages. But, after all,\ncarriages had their good points; they were easy, for instance, to get\nin and out of, which was an important consideration, for the royal train\nremained for long immune from modern conveniences, and when it drew up,\non some border moorland, far from any platform, the highbred dames were\nobliged to descend to earth by the perilous foot-board, the only pair\nof folding steps being reserved for Her Majesty's saloon. In the days of\ncrinolines such moments were sometimes awkward; and it was occasionally\nnecessary to summon Mr. Johnstone, the short and sturdy Manager of the\nCaledonian Railway, who, more than once, in a high gale and drenching\nrain with great difficulty \"pushed up\"--as he himself described it--some\nunlucky Lady Blanche or Lady Agatha into her compartment. But Victoria\ncared for none of these things. She was only intent upon regaining, with\nthe utmost swiftness, her enchanted Castle, where every spot was charged\nwith memories, where every memory was sacred, and where life was passed\nin an incessant and delightful round of absolutely trivial events.\nAnd it was not only the place that she loved; she was equally attached\nto \"the simple mountaineers,\" from whom, she said, \"she learnt many\na lesson of resignation and faith.\" Smith and Grant and Ross and\nThompson--she was devoted to them all; but, beyond the rest, she was\ndevoted to John Brown. The Prince's gillie had now become the Queen's\npersonal attendant--a body servant from whom she was never parted, who\naccompanied her on her drives, waited on her during the day, and\nslept in a neighbouring chamber at night. She liked his strength, his\nsolidity, the sense he gave her of physical security; she even liked his\nrugged manners and his rough unaccommodating speech. She allowed him to\ntake liberties with her which would have been unthinkable from anybody\nelse. To bully the Queen, to order her about, to reprimand her--who\ncould dream of venturing upon such audacities? And yet, when she\nreceived such treatment from John Brown, she positively seemed to enjoy\nit. The eccentricity appeared to be extraordinary; but, after all, it\nis no uncommon thing for an autocratic dowager to allow some trusted\nindispensable servant to adopt towards her an attitude of authority\nwhich is jealously forbidden to relatives or friends: the power of a\ndependent still remains, by a psychological sleight-of-hand, one's own\npower, even when it is exercised over oneself. When Victoria meekly\nobeyed the abrupt commands of her henchman to get off her pony or put on\nher shawl, was she not displaying, and in the highest degree, the force\nof her volition? People might wonder; she could not help that; this was\nthe manner in which it pleased her to act, and there was an end of it.\nTo have submitted her judgment to a son or a Minister might have seemed\nwiser or more natural; but if she had done so, she instinctively felt,\nshe would indeed have lost her independence. And yet upon somebody\nshe longed to depend. Her days were heavy with the long process of\ndomination. As she drove in silence over the moors she leaned back in\nthe carriage, oppressed and weary; but what a relief--John Brown was\nbehind on the rumble, and his strong arm would be there for her to lean\nupon when she got out.\nHe had, too, in her mind, a special connection with Albert. In their\nexpeditions the Prince had always trusted him more than anyone; the\ngruff, kind, hairy Scotsman was, she felt, in some mysterious way,\na legacy from the dead. She came to believe at last--or so it\nappeared--that the spirit of Albert was nearer when Brown was near.",

But it was also noticed that sometimes in such\nmoments of doubt and hesitation Her Majesty's looks would fix themselves\nupon John Brown.\nEventually, the \"simple mountaineer\" became almost a state personage.\nThe influence which he wielded was not to be overlooked. Lord\nBeaconsfield was careful, from time to time, to send courteous messages\nto \"Mr. Brown\" in his letters to the Queen, and the French Government\ntook particular pains to provide for his comfort during the visits of\nthe English Sovereign to France. It was only natural that among the\nelder members of the royal family he should not have been popular, and\nthat his failings--for failings he had, though Victoria would never\nnotice his too acute appreciation of Scotch whisky--should have been\nthe subject of acrimonious comment at Court. But he served his mistress\nfaithfully, and to ignore him would be a sign of disrespect to her\nbiographer. For the Queen, far from making a secret of her affectionate\nfriendship, took care to publish it to the world. By her orders two\ngold medals were struck in his honour; on his death, in 1883, a long and\neulogistic obituary notice of him appeared in the Court Circular; and a\nBrown memorial brooch--of gold, with the late gillie's head on one side\nand the royal monogram on the other--was designed by Her Majesty for\npresentation to her Highland servants and cottagers, to be worn by them\non the anniversary of his death, with a mourning scarf and pins. In the\nsecond series of extracts from the Queen's Highland Journal, published\nin 1884, her \"devoted personal attendant and faithful friend\" appears\nupon almost every page, and is in effect the hero of the book. With an\nabsence of reticence remarkable in royal persons, Victoria seemed to\ndemand, in this private and delicate matter, the sympathy of the whole\nnation; and yet--such is the world--there were those who actually\ntreated the relations between their Sovereign and her servant as a theme\nfor ribald jests.",

The nation's attitude\ntowards her, critical and even hostile as it had been for so many years,\naltogether changed; while there was a corresponding alteration in the\ntemper of--Victoria's own mind.\nMany causes led to this result. Among them were the repeated strokes of\npersonal misfortune which befell the Queen during a cruelly short space\nof years. In 1878 the Princess Alice, who had married in 1862 the Prince\nLouis of Hesse-Darmstadt, died in tragic circumstances. In the following\nyear the Prince Imperial, the only son of the Empress Eugenie, to whom\nVictoria, since the catastrophe of 1870, had become devotedly attached,\nwas killed in the Zulu War. Two years later, in 1881, the Queen lost\nLord Beaconsfield, and, in 1883, John Brown.

            "text": "An event which occurred in 1882 revealed and accentuated the feelings of\nthe nation. As the Queen, at Windsor, was walking from the train to her\ncarriage, a youth named Roderick Maclean fired a pistol at her from a\ndistance of a few yards. An Eton boy struck up Maclean's arm with an\numbrella before the pistol went off; no damage was done, and the culprit\nwas at once arrested. This was the last of a series of seven attempts\nupon the Queen--attempts which, taking place at sporadic intervals over\na period of forty years, resembled one another in a curious manner. All,\nwith a single exception, were perpetrated by adolescents, whose motives\nwere apparently not murderous, since, save in the case of Maclean, none\nof their pistols was loaded. These unhappy youths, who, after buying\ntheir cheap weapons, stuffed them with gunpowder and paper, and then\nwent off, with the certainty of immediate detection, to click them in\nthe face of royalty, present a strange problem to the psychologist. But,\nthough in each case their actions and their purposes seemed to be so\nsimilar, their fates were remarkably varied. The first of them, Edward\nOxford, who fired at Victoria within a few months of her marriage, was\ntried for high treason, declared to be insane, and sent to an asylum for\nlife. It appears, however, that this sentence did not commend itself to\nAlbert, for when, two years later, John Francis committed the same of\nfence, and was tried upon the same charge, the Prince propounced that\nthere was no insanity in the matter. \"The wretched creature,\" he told\nhis father, was \"not out of his mind, but a thorough scamp.\" \"I hope,\"\nhe added, \"his trial will be conducted with the greatest strictness.\"\nApparently it was; at any rate, the jury shared the view of the Prince,\nthe plea of insanity was, set aside, and Francis was found guilty of\nhigh treason and condemned to death; but, as there was no proof of\nan intent to kill or even to wound, this sentence, after a lengthened\ndeliberation between the Home Secretary and the Judges, was commuted for\none of transportation for life. As the law stood, these assaults, futile\nas they were, could only be treated as high treason; the discrepancy\nbetween the actual deed and the tremendous penalties involved was\nobviously grotesque; and it was, besides, clear that a jury, knowing\nthat a verdict of guilty implied a sentence of death, would tend to\nthe alternative course, and find the prisoner not guilty but insane--a\nconclusion which, on the face of it, would have appeared to be the more\nreasonable. In 1842, therefore, an Act was passed making any attempt\nto hurt the Queen a misdemeanor, punishable by transportation for seven\nyears, or imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not\nexceeding three years--the misdemeanant, at the discretion of the Court,\n\"to be publicly or privately whipped, as often, and in such manner\nand form, as the Court shall direct, not exceeding thrice.\" The four\nsubsequent attempts were all dealt with under this new law; William\nBean, in 1842, was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment; William\nHamilton, in 1849, was transported for seven years; and, in 1850, the\nsame sentence was passed upon Lieutenant Robert Pate, who struck the\nQueen on the head with his cane in Piccadilly. Pate, alone among these\ndelinquents, was of mature years; he had held a commission in the Army,\ndressed himself as a dandy, and was, the Prince declared, \"manifestly\nderanged.\" In 1872 Arthur O'Connor, a youth of seventeen, fired\nan unloaded pistol at the Queen outside Buckingham Palace; he\nwas immediately seized by John Brown, and sentenced to one year's\nimprisonment and twenty strokes of the birch rod. It was for his bravery\nupon this occasion that Brown was presented with one of his gold medals.\nIn all these cases the jury had refused to allow the plea of insanity;\nbut Roderick Maclean's attempt in 1882 had a different issue. On this\noccasion the pistol was found to have been loaded, and the public\nindignation, emphasised as it was by Victoria's growing popularity,\nwas particularly great. Either for this or for some other reason the\nprocedure of the last forty years was abandoned, and Maclean was tried\nfor high treason. The result was what might have been expected: the jury\nbrought in a verdict of \"not guilty, but insane\"; and the prisoner was\nsent to an asylum during Her Majesty's pleasure. Their verdict, however,\nproduced a remarkable consequence. Victoria, who doubtless carried in\nher mind some memory of Albert's disapproval of a similar verdict in\nthe case of Oxford, was very much annoyed. What did the jury mean, she\nasked, by saying that Maclean was not guilty? It was perfectly clear\nthat he was guilty--she had seen him fire off the pistol herself. It was\nin vain that Her Majesty's constitutional advisers reminded her of the\nprinciple of English law which lays down that no man can be found\nguilty of a crime unless he be proved to have had a criminal intention.\nVictoria was quite unconvinced. \"If that is the law,\" she said, \"the law\nmust be altered:\" and altered it was. In 1883 an Act was passed changing\nthe form of the verdict in cases of insanity, and the confusing anomaly\nremains upon the Statute Book to this day.",

During the crisis\nin the Sudan, the popular temper was her own. She had been among the\nfirst to urge the necessity of an expedition to Khartoum, and, when the\nnews came of the catastrophic death of General Gordon, her voice led the\nchorus of denunciation which raved against the Government. In her rage,\nshe despatched a fulminating telegram to Mr. Gladstone, not in the usual\ncypher, but open; and her letter of condolence to Miss Gordon, in which\nshe attacked her Ministers for breach of faith, was widely published.\nIt was rumoured that she had sent for Lord Hartington, the Secretary\nof State for War, and vehemently upbraided him. \"She rated me,\" he was\nreported to have told a friend, \"as if I'd been a footman.\" \"Why didn't\nshe send for the butler?\" asked his friend. \"Oh,\" was the reply, \"the\nbutler generally manages to keep out of the way on such occasions.\"\nBut the day came when it was impossible to keep out of the way any\nlonger.

Her habit of life was suddenly altered; abandoning\nthe long seclusion which Disraeli's persuasions had only momentarily\ninterrupted, she threw herself vigorously into a multitude of public\nactivities. She appeared at drawing-rooms, at concerts, at reviews; she\nlaid foundation-stones; she went to Liverpool to open an international\nexhibition, driving through the streets in her open carriage in heavy\nrain amid vast applauding crowds. Delighted by the welcome which met\nher everywhere, she warmed to her work. She visited Edinburgh, where the\novation of Liverpool was repeated and surpassed. In London, she opened\nin high state the Colonial and Indian Exhibition at South Kensington.\nOn this occasion the ceremonial was particularly magnificent; a blare\nof trumpets announced the approach of Her Majesty; the \"Natiohal Anthem\"\nfollowed; and the Queen, seated on a gorgeous throne of hammered gold,\nreplied with her own lips to the address that was presented to her.

For\nshe was a part of the establishment--an essential part as it seemed--a\nfixture--a magnificent, immovable sideboard in the huge saloon of\nstate. Without her the heaped-up banquet of 1890 would have lost\nits distinctive quality--the comfortable order of the substantial\nunambiguous dishes, with their background of weighty glamour, half out\nof sight.\nHer own existence came to harmonise more and more with what was around\nher. Gradually, imperceptibly, Albert receded. It was not that he was\nforgotten--that would have been impossible--but that the void created\nby his absence grew less agonising, and even, at last, less obvious.\nAt last Victoria found it possible to regret the bad weather without\nimmediately reflecting that her \"dear Albert always said we could not\nalter it, but must leave it as it was;\" she could even enjoy a good\nbreakfast without considering how \"dear Albert\" would have liked the\nbuttered eggs. And, as that figure slowly faded, its place was taken,\ninevitably, by Victoria's own. Her being, revolving for so many years\nround an external object, now changed its motion and found its centre\nin itself. It had to be so: her domestic position, the pressure of\nher public work, her indomitable sense of duty, made anything else\nimpossible. Her egotism proclaimed its rights. Her age increased still\nfurther the surrounding deference; and her force of character, emerging\nat length in all its plenitude, imposed absolutely upon its environment\nby the conscious effort of an imperious will.\nLittle by little it was noticed that the outward vestiges of Albert's\nposthumous domination grew less complete. At Court the stringency of\nmourning was relaxed. As the Queen drove through the Park in her open\ncarriage with her Highlanders behind her, nursery-maids canvassed\neagerly the growing patch of violet velvet in the bonnet with its jet\nappurtenances on the small bowing head.\nIt was in her family that Victoria's ascendancy reached its highest\npoint. All her offspring were married; the number of her descendants\nrapidly increased; there were many marriages in the third generation;\nand no fewer than thirty-seven of her great-grandchildren were living at\nthe time of her death. A picture of the period displays the royal family\ncollected together in one of the great rooms at Windsor--a crowded\ncompany of more than fifty persons, with the imperial matriarch in\ntheir midst. Over them all she ruled with a most potent sway. The small\nconcerns of the youngest aroused her passionate interest; and the oldest\nshe treated as if they were children still. The Prince of Wales, in\nparticular, stood in tremendous awe of his mother. She had steadily\nrefused to allow him the slightest participation in the business of\ngovernment; and he had occupied himself in other ways. Nor could it\nbe denied that he enjoyed himself--out of her sight; but, in that\nredoubtable presence, his abounding manhood suffered a miserable\neclipse. Once, at Osborne, when, owing to no fault of his, he was too\nlate for a dinner party, he was observed standing behind a pillar and\nwiping the sweat from his forehead, trying to nerve himself to go up to\nthe Queen. When at last he did so, she gave him a stiff nod, whereupon\nhe vanished immediately behind another pillar, and remained there until\nthe party broke up. At the time of this incident the Prince of Wales was\nover fifty years of age.\nIt was inevitable that the Queen's domestic activities should\noccasionally trench upon the domain of high diplomacy; and this was\nespecially the case when the interests of her eldest daughter, the\nCrown Princess of Prussia, were at stake. The Crown Prince held liberal\nopinions; he was much influenced by his wife; and both were detested by\nBismarck, who declared with scurrilous emphasis that the Englishwoman\nand her mother were a menace to the Prussian State. The feud was still\nfurther intensified when, on the death of the old Emperor (1888), the\nCrown Prince succeeded to the throne. A family entanglement brought on\na violent crisis. One of the daughters of the new Empress had become\nbetrothed to Prince Alexander of Battenberg, who had lately been\nejected from the throne of Bulgaria owing to the hostility of the Tsar.\nVictoria, as well as the Empress, highly approved of the match. Of the\ntwo brothers of Prince Alexander, the elder had married another of her\ngrand-daughters, and the younger was the husband of her daughter, the\nPrincess Beatrice; she was devoted to the handsome young man; and she\nwas delighted by the prospect of the third brother--on the whole the\nhandsomest, she thought, of the three--also becoming a member of her\nfamily. Unfortunately, however, Bismarck was opposed to the scheme.\nHe perceived that the marriage would endanger the friendship between\nGermany and Russia, which was vital to his foreign policy, and he\nannounced that it must not take place. A fierce struggle between the\nEmpress and the Chancellor followed. Victoria, whose hatred of her\ndaughter's enemy was unbounded, came over to Charlottenburg to join in\nthe fray. Bismarck, over his pipe and lager, snorted out his alarm. The\nQueen of England's object, he said, was clearly political--she wished to\nestrange Germany and Russia--and very likely she would have her way. \"In\nfamily matters,\" he added, \"she is not used to contradiction;\" she would\n\"bring the parson with her in her travelling bag and the bridegroom in\nher trunk, and the marriage would come off on the spot.\" But the man\nof blood and iron was not to be thwarted so easily, and he asked for a\nprivate interview with the Queen. The details of their conversation are\nunknown; but it is certain that in the course of it Victoria was forced\nto realise the meaning of resistance to that formidable personage, and\nthat she promised to use all her influence to prevent the marriage. The\nengagement was broken off; and in the following year Prince Alexander of\nBattenberg united himself to Fraulein Loisinger, an actress at the court\ntheatre of Darmstad.\nBut such painful incidents were rare. Victoria was growing very old;\nwith no Albert to guide her, with no Beaconsfield to enflame her, she\nwas willing enough to abandon the dangerous questions of diplomacy\nto the wisdom of Lord Salisbury, and to concentrate her energies upon\nobjects which touched her more nearly and over which she could\nexercise an undisputed control. Her home--her court--the monuments\nat Balmoral--the livestock at Windsor--the organisation of her\nengagements--the supervision of the multitudinous details of her daily\nroutine--such matters played now an even greater part in her existence\nthan before. Her life passed in an extraordinary exactitude. Every\nmoment of her day was mapped out beforehand; the succession of her\nengagements was immutably fixed; the dates of her journeys--to Osborne,\nto Balmoral, to the South of France, to Windsor, to London--were hardly\naltered from year to year. She demanded from those who surrounded her\na rigid precision in details, and she was preternaturally quick in\ndetecting the slightest deviation from the rules which she had laid\ndown. Such was the irresistible potency of her personality, that\nanything but the most implicit obedience to her wishes was felt to be\nimpossible; but sometimes somebody was unpunctual; and unpunctuality\nwas one of the most heinous of sins. Then her displeasure--her dreadful\ndispleasure--became all too visible. At such moments there seemed\nnothing surprising in her having been the daughter of a martinet.\nBut these storms, unnerving as they were while they lasted, were quickly\nover, and they grew more and more exceptional. With the return of\nhappiness a gentle benignity flowed from the aged Queen. Her smile, once\nso rare a visitant to those saddened features, flitted over them with an\neasy alacrity; the blue eyes beamed; the whole face, starting suddenly\nfrom its pendulous expressionlessness, brightened and softened and cast\nover those who watched it an unforgettable charm. For in her last years\nthere was a fascination in Victoria's amiability which had been lacking\neven from the vivid impulse of her youth. Over all who approached\nher--or very nearly all--she threw a peculiar spell. Her grandchildren\nadored her; her ladies waited upon her with a reverential love. The\nhonour of serving her obliterated a thousand inconveniences--the\nmonotony of a court existence, the fatigue of standing, the necessity\nfor a superhuman attentiveness to the minutia: of time and space. As one\ndid one's wonderful duty one could forget that one's legs were aching",

            "text": "from the infinitude of the passages at Windsor, or that one's bare arms\nwere turning blue in the Balmoral cold.\nWhat, above all, seemed to make such service delightful was the detailed\ninterest which the Queen took in the circumstances of those around\nher. Her absorbing passion for the comfortable commonplaces, the small\ncrises, the recurrent sentimentalities, of domestic life constantly\ndemanded wider fields for its activity; the sphere of her own family,\nvast as it was, was not enough; she became the eager confidante of\nthe household affairs of her ladies; her sympathies reached out to\nthe palace domestics; even the housemaids and scullions--so it\nappeared--were the objects of her searching inquiries, and of her\nheartfelt solicitude when their lovers were ordered to a foreign\nstation, or their aunts suffered from an attack of rheumatism which was\nmore than usually acute.\nNevertheless the due distinctions of rank were immaculately preserved.\nThe Queen's mere presence was enough to ensure that; but, in addition,\nthe dominion of court etiquette was paramount. For that elaborate code,\nwhich had kept Lord Melbourne stiff upon the sofa and ranged the other\nguests in silence about the round table according to the order of\nprecedence, was as punctiliously enforced as ever. Every evening after\ndinner, the hearth-rug, sacred to royalty, loomed before the profane in\ninaccessible glory, or, on one or two terrific occasions, actually lured\nthem magnetically forward to the very edge of the abyss. The Queen, at\nthe fitting moment, moved towards her guests; one after the other they\nwere led up to her; and, while dialogue followed dialogue in constraint\nand embarrassment, the rest of the assembly stood still, without a word.\nOnly in one particular was the severity of the etiquette allowed to\nlapse. Throughout the greater part of the reign the rule that ministers\nmust stand during their audiences with the Queen had been absolute. When\nLord Derby, the Prime Minister, had an audience of Her Majesty after\na serious illness, he mentioned it afterwards, as a proof of the royal\nfavour, that the Queen had remarked \"How sorry she was she could not ask\nhim to be seated.\" Subsequently, Disraeli, after an attack of gout\nand in a moment of extreme expansion on the part of Victoria, had\nbeen offered a chair; but he had thought it wise humbly to decline the\nprivilege. In her later years, however, the Queen invariably asked Mr.\nGladstone and Lord Salisbury to sit down.\nSometimes the solemnity of the evening was diversified by a concert, an\nopera, or even a play. One of the most marked indications of\nVictoria's enfranchisement from the thraldom of widowhood had been\nher resumption--after an interval of thirty years--of the custom of\ncommanding dramatic companies from London to perform before the Court at\nWindsor. On such occasions her spirits rose high. She loved acting; she\nloved a good plot; above all, she loved a farce. Engrossed by everything\nthat passed upon the stage she would follow, with childlike innocence,\nthe unwinding of the story; or she would assume an air of knowing\nsuperiority and exclaim in triumph, \"There! You didn't expect that, did\nyou?\" when the denouement came. Her sense of humour was of a vigorous\nthough primitive kind. She had been one of the very few persons who had\nalways been able to appreciate the Prince Consort's jokes; and, when\nthose were cracked no more, she could still roar with laughter, in the\nprivacy of her household, over some small piece of fun--some oddity of\nan ambassador, or some ignorant Minister's faux pas. When the jest grew\nsubtle she was less pleased; but, if it approached the confines of the\nindecorous, the danger was serious. To take a liberty called down at\nonce Her Majesty's most crushing disapprobation; and to say something\nimproper was to take the greatest liberty of all. Then the royal\nlips sank down at the corners, the royal eyes stared in astonished\nprotrusion, and in fact, the royal countenance became inauspicious in\nthe highest degree. The transgressor shuddered into silence, while the\nawful \"We are not amused\" annihilated the dinner table. Afterwards,\nin her private entourage, the Queen would observe that the person in\nquestion was, she very much feared, \"not discreet\"; it was a verdict\nfrom which there was no appeal.\nIn general, her aesthetic tastes had remained unchanged since the days\nof Mendelssohn, Landseer, and Lablache. She still delighted in the\nroulades of Italian opera; she still demanded a high standard in the\nexecution of a pianoforte duet. Her views on painting were decided;\nSir Edwin, she declared, was perfect; she was much impressed by Lord\nLeighton's manners; and she profoundly distrusted Mr. Watts. From time\nto time she ordered engraved portraits to be taken of members of\nthe royal family; on these occasions she would have the first proofs\nsubmitted to her, and, having inspected them with minute particularity,\nshe would point out their mistakes to the artists, indicating at the\nsame time how they might be corrected. The artists invariably discovered\nthat Her Majesty's suggestions were of the highest value. In literature\nher interests were more restricted. She was devoted to Lord Tennyson;\nand, as the Prince Consort had admired George Eliot, she perused\n\"Middlemarch:\" she was disappointed. There is reason to believe,\nhowever, that the romances of another female writer, whose popularity\namong the humbler classes of Her Majesty's subjects was at one time\nenormous, secured, no less, the approval of Her Majesty. Otherwise she\ndid not read very much.\nOnce, however, the Queen's attention was drawn to a publication which it\nwas impossible for her to ignore. \"The Greville Memoirs,\" filled with a\nmass of historical information of extraordinary importance, but filled\nalso with descriptions, which were by no means flattering, of George\nIV, William IV, and other royal persons, was brought out by Mr. Reeve.\nVictoria read the book, and was appalled. It was, she declared, a\n\"dreadful and really scandalous book,\" and she could not say \"how\nHORRIFIED and INDIGNANT\" she was at Greville's \"indiscretion,\nindelicacy, ingratitude towards friends, betrayal of confidence and\nshameful disloyalty towards his Sovereign.\" She wrote to Disraeli to\ntell him that in her opinion it was \"VERY IMPORTANT that the book should\nbe severely censured and discredited.\" \"The tone in which he speaks of\nroyalty,\" she added, \"is unlike anything one sees in history even,\nand is most reprehensible.\" Her anger was directed with almost equal\nvehemence against Mr. Reeve for his having published \"such an abominable\nbook,\" and she charged Sir Arthur Helps to convey to him her deep\ndispleasure. Mr. Reeve, however, was impenitent. When Sir Arthur told\nhim that, in the Queen's opinion, \"the book degraded royalty,\" he\nreplied: \"Not at all; it elevates it by the contrast it offers between\nthe present and the defunct state of affairs.\" But this adroit defence\nfailed to make any impression upon Victoria; and Mr. Reeve, when he\nretired from the public service, did not receive the knighthood which\ncustom entitled him to expect. Perhaps if the Queen had known how many\ncaustic comments upon herself Mr. Reeve had quietly suppressed in the\npublished Memoirs, she would have been almost grateful to him; but, in\nthat case, what would she have said of Greville? Imagination boggles at\nthe thought. As for more modern essays upon the same topic, Her Majesty,\nit is to be feared, would have characterised them as \"not discreet.\"\nBut as a rule the leisure hours of that active life were occupied with\nrecreations of a less intangible quality than the study of literature or\nthe appreciation of art. Victoria was a woman not only of vast property\nbut of innumerable possessions. She had inherited an immense quantity\nof furniture, of ornaments, of china, of plate, of valuable objects of\nevery kind; her purchases, throughout a long life, made a formidable\naddition to these stores; and there flowed in upon her, besides, from\nevery quarter of the globe, a constant stream of gifts. Over this\nenormous mass she exercised an unceasing and minute supervision, and the\narrangement and the contemplation of it, in all its details, filled her\nwith an intimate satisfaction. The collecting instinct has its roots in\nthe very depths of human nature; and, in the case of Victoria, it seemed\nto owe its force to two of her dominating impulses--the intense sense,\nwhich had always been hers, of her own personality, and the craving\nwhich, growing with the years, had become in her old age almost an\nobsession, for fixity, for solidity, for the setting up of palpable\nbarriers against the outrages of change and time. When she considered\nthe multitudinous objects which belonged to her, or, better still, when,\nchoosing out some section of them as the fancy took her, she actually\nsavoured the vivid richness of their individual qualities, she saw\nherself deliciously reflected from a million facets, felt herself\nmagnified miraculously over a boundless area, and was well pleased.\nThat was just as it should be; but then came the dismaying\nthought--everything slips away, crumbles, vanishes; Sevres\ndinner-services get broken; even golden basins go unaccountably astray;\neven one's self, with all the recollections and experiences that make\nup one's being, fluctuates, perishes, dissolves... But no! It could\nnot, should not be so! There should be no changes and no losses! Nothing\nshould ever move--neither the past nor the present--and she herself\nleast of all! And so the tenacious woman, hoarding her valuables,\ndecreed their immortality with all the resolution of her soul. She would\nnot lose one memory or one pin.\nShe gave orders that nothing should be thrown away--and nothing was.\nThere, in drawer after drawer, in wardrobe after wardrobe, reposed the\ndresses of seventy years. But not only the dresses--the furs and the\nmantles and subsidiary frills and the muffs and the parasols and the\nbonnets--all were ranged in chronological order, dated and complete. A\ngreat cupboard was devoted to the dolls; in the china room at Windsor a\nspecial table held the mugs of her childhood, and her children's mugs as\nwell. Mementoes of the past surrounded her in serried accumulations.\nIn every room the tables were powdered thick with the photographs of\nrelatives; their portraits, revealing them at all ages, covered the\nwalls; their figures, in solid marble, rose up from pedestals, or\ngleamed from brackets in the form of gold and silver statuettes. The\ndead, in every shape--in miniatures, in porcelain, in enormous life-size\noil-paintings--were perpetually about her. John Brown stood upon her\nwriting-table in solid gold. Her favourite horses and dogs, endowed with\na new durability, crowded round her footsteps. Sharp, in silver gilt,\ndominated the dinner table; Boy and Boz lay together among unfading\nflowers, in bronze. And it was not enough that each particle of the\npast should be given the stability of metal or of marble: the whole\ncollection, in its arrangement, no less than its entity, should be\nimmutably fixed. There might be additions, but there might never be\nalterations. No chintz might change, no carpet, no curtain, be replaced\nby another; or, if long use at last made it necessary, the stuffs and\nthe patterns must be so identically reproduced that the keenest eye\nmight not detect the difference. No new picture could be hung upon the\nwalls at Windsor, for those already there had been put in their places\nby Albert, whose decisions were eternal. So, indeed, were Victoria's.\nTo ensure that they should be the aid of the camera was called in. Every\nsingle article in the Queen's possession was photographed from several\npoints of view. These photographs were submitted to Her Majesty, and\nwhen, after careful inspection, she had approved of them, they were\nplaced in a series of albums, richly bound. Then, opposite each\nphotograph, an entry was made, indicating the number of the article, the\nnumber of the room in which it was kept, its exact position in the room\nand all its principal characteristics. The fate of every object which\nhad undergone this process was henceforth irrevocably sealed. The\nwhole multitude, once and for all, took up its steadfast station. And\nVictoria, with a gigantic volume or two of the endless catalogue always\nbeside her, to look through, to ponder upon, to expatiate over, could\nfeel, with a double contentment, that the transitoriness of this world\nhad been arrested by the amplitude of her might.\nThus the collection, ever multiplying, ever encroaching upon new fields\nof consciousness, ever rooting itself more firmly in the depths of\ninstinct, became one of the dominating influences of that strange\nexistence. It was a collection not merely of things and of thoughts,\nbut of states of mind and ways of living as well. The celebration of\nanniversaries grew to be an important branch of it--of birthdays and\nmarriage days and death days, each of which demanded its appropriate\nfeeling, which, in its turn, must be itself expressed in an appropriate\noutward form. And the form, of course--the ceremony of rejoicing\nor lamentation--was stereotyped with the rest: it was part of the\ncollection. On a certain day, for instance, flowers must be strewn on\nJohn Brown's monument at Balmoral; and the date of the yearly departure\nfor Scotland was fixed by that fact. Inevitably it was around the\ncentral circumstance of death--death, the final witness to human\nmutability--that these commemorative cravings clustered most thickly.\nMight not even death itself be humbled, if one could recall enough--if\none asserted, with a sufficiently passionate and reiterated emphasis,\nthe eternity of love? Accordingly, every bed in which Victoria slept had\nattached to it, at the back, on the right-hand side, above the pillow,\na photograph of the head and shoulders of Albert as he lay dead,\nsurmounted by a wreath of immortelles. At Balmoral, where memories came\ncrowding so closely, the solid signs of memory appeared in surprising\nprofusion. Obelisks, pyramids, tombs, statues, cairns, and seats of\ninscribed granite, proclaimed Victoria's dedication to the dead. There,\ntwice a year, on the days that followed her arrival, a solemn\npilgrimage of inspection and meditation was performed. There, on August\n26--Albert's birthday--at the foot of the bronze statue of him in\nHighland dress, the Queen, her family, her Court, her servants, and her\ntenantry, met together and in silence drank to the memory of the dead.\nIn England the tokens of remembrance pullulated hardly less. Not a\nday passed without some addition to the multifold assemblage--a gold\nstatuette of Ross, the piper--a life-sized marble group of Victoria and\nAlbert, in medieval costume, inscribed upon the base with the words:\n\"Allured to brighter worlds and led the way-\" a granite slab in the\nshrubbery at Osborne, informing the visitor of \"Waldmann: the very\nfavourite little dachshund of Queen Victoria; who brought him from\nBaden, April 1872; died, July 11, 1881.\"\nAt Frogmore, the great mausoleum, perpetually enriched, was visited\nalmost daily by the Queen when the Court was at Windsor. But there was\nanother, a more secret and a hardly less holy shrine. The suite of rooms\nwhich Albert had occupied in the Castle was kept for ever shut away\nfrom the eyes of any save the most privileged. Within those precincts\neverything remained as it had been at the Prince's death; but the\nmysterious preoccupation of Victoria had commanded that her husband's\nclothing should be laid afresh, each evening, upon the bed, and that,\neach evening, the water should be set ready in the basin, as if he were\nstill alive; and this incredible rite was performed with scrupulous\nregularity for nearly forty years.",

            "text": "Such was the inner worship; and still the flesh obeyed the spirit; still\nthe daily hours of labour proclaimed Victoria's consecration to duty\nand to the ideal of the dead. Yet, with the years, the sense of\nself-sacrifice faded; the natural energies of that ardent being\ndischarged themselves with satisfaction into the channel of public work;\nthe love of business which, from her girlhood, had been strong within\nher, reasserted itself in all its vigour, and, in her old age, to\nhave been cut off from her papers and her boxes would have been, not a\nrelief, but an agony to Victoria. Thus, though toiling Ministers might\nsigh and suffer, the whole process of government continued, till the\nvery end, to pass before her. Nor was that all; ancient precedent\nhad made the validity of an enormous number of official transactions\ndependent upon the application of the royal sign-manual; and a great\nproportion of the Queen's working hours was spent in this mechanical\ntask. Nor did she show any desire to diminish it. On the contrary, she\nvoluntarily resumed the duty of signing commissions in the army, from\nwhich she had been set free by Act of Parliament, and from which,\nduring the years of middle life, she had abstained. In no case would she\ncountenance the proposal that she should use a stamp. But, at last, when\nthe increasing pressure of business made the delays of the antiquated\nsystem intolerable, she consented that, for certain classes of\ndocuments, her oral sanction should be sufficient. Each paper was read\naloud to her, and she said at the end \"Approved.\" Often, for hours at a\ntime, she would sit, with Albert's bust in front of her, while the word\n\"Approved\" issued at intervals from her lips. The word came forth with\na majestic sonority; for her voice now--how changed from the silvery\ntreble of her girlhood--was a contralto, full and strong.\nIV\nThe final years were years of apotheosis. In the dazzled imagination\nof her subjects Victoria soared aloft towards the regions of divinity\nthrough a nimbus of purest glory. Criticism fell dumb; deficiencies\nwhich, twenty years earlier, would have been universally admitted, were\nnow as universally ignored. That the nation's idol was a very incomplete\nrepresentative of the nation was a circumstance that was hardly noticed,\nand yet it was conspicuously true. For the vast changes which, out of\nthe England of 1837, had produced the England of 1897, seemed scarcely\nto have touched the Queen. The immense industrial development of the\nperiod, the significance of which had been so thoroughly understood\nby Albert, meant little indeed to Victoria. The amazing scientific\nmovement, which Albert had appreciated no less, left Victoria perfectly\ncold. Her conception of the universe, and of man's place in it, and of\nthe stupendous problems of nature and philosophy remained, throughout\nher life, entirely unchanged. Her religion was the religion which she\nhad learnt from the Baroness Lehzen and the Duchess of Kent. Here, too,\nit might have been supposed that Albert's views might have influenced\nher. For Albert, in matters of religion, was advanced. Disbelieving\naltogether in evil spirits, he had had his doubts about the miracle\nof the Gaderene Swine. Stockmar, even, had thrown out, in a remarkable\nmemorandum on the education of the Prince of Wales, the suggestion that\nwhile the child \"must unquestionably be brought up in the creed of the\nChurch of England,\" it might nevertheless be in accordance with\nthe spirit of the times to exclude from his religious training the\ninculcation of a belief in \"the supernatural doctrines of Christianity.\"\nThis, however, would have been going too far; and all the royal children\nwere brought up in complete orthodoxy. Anything else would have grieved\nVictoria, though her own conceptions of the orthodox were not very\nprecise. But her nature, in which imagination and subtlety held so small\na place, made her instinctively recoil from the intricate ecstasies\nof High Anglicanism; and she seemed to feel most at home in the simple\nfaith of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. This was what might have\nbeen expected; for Lehzen was the daughter of a Lutheran pastor, and the\nLutherans and the Presbyterians have much in common. For many years Dr.\nNorman Macleod, an innocent Scotch minister, was her principal spiritual\nadviser; and, when he was taken from her, she drew much comfort from\nquiet chats about life and death with the cottagers at Balmoral.\nHer piety, absolutely genuine, found what it wanted in the sober\nexhortations of old John Grant and the devout saws of Mrs. P.\nFarquharson. They possessed the qualities, which, as a child of\nfourteen, she had so sincerely admired in the Bishop of Chester's\n\"Exposition of the Gospel of St. Matthew;\" they were \"just plain and\ncomprehensible and full of truth and good feeling.\" The Queen, who gave\nher name to the Age of Mill and of Darwin, never got any further than\nthat.\nFrom the social movements of her time Victoria was equally remote.\nTowards the smallest no less than towards the greatest changes she\nremained inflexible. During her youth and middle age smoking had been\nforbidden in polite society, and so long as she lived she would not\nwithdraw her anathema against it. Kings might protest; bishops and\nambassadors, invited to Windsor, might be reduced, in the privacy of\ntheir bedrooms, to lie full-length upon the floor and smoke up the\nchimney--the interdict continued! It might have been supposed that a\nfemale sovereign would have lent her countenance to one of the most\nvital of all the reforms to which her epoch gave birth--the emancipation\nof women--but, on the contrary, the mere mention of such a proposal sent\nthe blood rushing to her head. In 1870, her eye having fallen upon the\nreport of a meeting in favour of Women's Suffrage, she wrote to Mr.\nMartin in royal rage--\"The Queen is most anxious to enlist everyone\nwho can speak or write to join in checking this mad, wicked folly of\n'Woman's Rights,' with all its attendant horrors, on which her poor\nfeeble sex is bent, forgetting every sense of womanly feeling and\npropriety. Lady--ought to get a GOOD WHIPPING. It is a subject which\nmakes the Queen so furious that she cannot contain herself. God\ncreated men and women different--then let them remain each in their own\nposition. Tennyson has some beautiful lines on the difference of men and\nwomen in 'The Princess.' Woman would become the most hateful, heartless,\nand disgusting of human beings were she allowed to unsex herself; and\nwhere would be the protection which man was intended to give the weaker\nsex? The Queen is sure that Mrs. Martin agrees with her.\" The argument\nwas irrefutable; Mrs. Martin agreed; and yet the canker spread.\nIn another direction Victoria's comprehension of the spirit of her age\nhas been constantly asserted. It was for long the custom for courtly\nhistorians and polite politicians to compliment the Queen upon the\ncorrectness of her attitude towards the Constitution. But such praises\nseem hardly to be justified by the facts. In her later years Victoria\nmore than once alluded with regret to her conduct during the Bedchamber\ncrisis, and let it be understood that she had grown wiser since. Yet\nin truth it is difficult to trace any fundamental change either in her\ntheory or her practice in constitutional matters throughout her life.\nThe same despotic and personal spirit which led her to break off the\nnegotiations with Peel is equally visible in her animosity towards\nPalmerston, in her threats of abdication to Disraeli, and in her desire\nto prosecute the Duke of Westminster for attending a meeting upon\nBulgarian atrocities. The complex and delicate principles of the\nConstitution cannot be said to have come within the compass of her\nmental faculties; and in the actual developments which it underwent\nduring her reign she played a passive part. From 1840 to 1861 the\npower of the Crown steadily increased in England; from 1861 to 1901 it\nsteadily declined. The first process was due to the influence of the\nPrince Consort, the second to that of a series of great Ministers.\nDuring the first Victoria was in effect a mere accessory; during the\nsecond the threads of power, which Albert had so laboriously collected,\ninevitably fell from her hands into the vigorous grasp of Mr. Gladstone,\nLord Beaconsfield, and Lord Salisbury. Perhaps, absorbed as she was in\nroutine, and difficult as she found it to distinguish at all clearly\nbetween the trivial and the essential, she was only dimly aware of what\nwas happening. Yet, at the end of her reign, the Crown was weaker than\nat any other time in English history. Paradoxically enough, Victoria\nreceived the highest eulogiums for assenting to a political evolution,\nwhich, had she completely realised its import, would have filled her\nwith supreme displeasure.\nNevertheless it must not be supposed that she was a second George III.\nHer desire to impose her will, vehement as it was, and unlimited by any\nprinciple, was yet checked by a certain shrewdness. She might oppose\nher Ministers with extraordinary violence, she might remain utterly\nimpervious to arguments and supplications; the pertinacity of her\nresolution might seem to be unconquerable; but, at the very last moment\nof all, her obstinacy would give way. Her innate respect and capacity\nfor business, and perhaps, too, the memory of Albert's scrupulous\navoidance of extreme courses, prevented her from ever entering an\nimpasse. By instinct she understood when the facts were too much for\nher, and to them she invariably yielded. After all, what else could she\ndo?\nBut if, in all these ways, the Queen and her epoch were profoundly\nseparated, the points of contact between them also were not few.\nVictoria understood very well the meaning and the attractions of power\nand property, and in such learning the English nation, too, had grown\nto be more and more proficient. During the last fifteen years of the\nreign--for the short Liberal Administration of 1892 was a mere interlude\nimperialism was the dominant creed of the country. It was Victoria's\nas well. In this direction, if in no other, she had allowed her mind to\ndevelop. Under Disraeli's tutelage the British Dominions over the seas\nhad come to mean much more to her than ever before, and, in particular,\nshe had grown enamoured of the East. The thought of India fascinated\nher; she set to, and learnt a little Hindustani; she engaged some Indian\nservants, who became her inseparable attendants, and one of whom, Munshi\nAbdul Karim, eventually almost succeeded to the position which had\nonce been John Brown's. At the same time, the imperialist temper of the\nnation invested her office with a new significance exactly harmonising\nwith her own inmost proclivities. The English polity was in the main\na common-sense structure, but there was always a corner in it where\ncommon-sense could not enter--where, somehow or other, the ordinary\nmeasurements were not applicable and the ordinary rules did not apply.\nSo our ancestors had laid it down, giving scope, in their wisdom, to\nthat mystical element which, as it seems, can never quite be eradicated\nfrom the affairs of men. Naturally it was in the Crown that the\nmysticism of the English polity was concentrated--the Crown, with its\nvenerable antiquity, its sacred associations, its imposing spectacular\narray. But, for nearly two centuries, common-sense had been predominant\nin the great building, and the little, unexplored, inexplicable corner\nhad attracted small attention. Then, with the rise of imperialism, there\nwas a change. For imperialism is a faith as well as a business; as\nit grew, the mysticism in English public life grew with it; and\nsimultaneously a new importance began to attach to the Crown. The\nneed for a symbol--a symbol of England's might, of England's worth,\nof England's extraordinary and mysterious destiny--became felt more\nurgently than ever before. The Crown was that symbol: and the Crown\nrested upon the head of Victoria. Thus it happened that while by the end\nof the reign the power of the sovereign had appreciably diminished, the\nprestige of the sovereign had enormously grown.\nYet this prestige was not merely the outcome of public changes; it was\nan intensely personal matter, too. Victoria was the Queen of England,\nthe Empress of India, the quintessential pivot round which the whole\nmagnificent machine was revolving--but how much more besides! For one\nthing, she was of a great age--an almost indispensable qualification for\npopularity in England. She had given proof of one of the most admired\ncharacteristics of the race--persistent vitality. She had reigned for\nsixty years, and she was not out. And then, she was a character. The\noutlines of her nature were firmly drawn, and, even through the mists\nwhich envelop royalty, clearly visible. In the popular imagination her\nfamiliar figure filled, with satisfying ease, a distinct and memorable\nplace. It was, besides, the kind of figure which naturally called forth\nthe admiring sympathy of the great majority of the nation. Goodness they\nprized above every other human quality; and Victoria, who had said\nthat she would be good at the age of twelve, had kept her word. Duty,\nconscience, morality--yes! in the light of those high beacons the\nQueen had always lived. She had passed her days in work and not in\npleasure--in public responsibilities and family cares. The standard\nof solid virtue which had been set up so long ago amid the domestic\nhappiness of Osborne had never been lowered for an instant. For more\nthan half a century no divorced lady had approached the precincts of the\nCourt. Victoria, indeed, in her enthusiasm for wifely fidelity, had laid\ndown a still stricter ordinance: she frowned severely upon any widow\nwho married again. Considering that she herself was the offspring of\na widow's second marriage, this prohibition might be regarded as an\neccentricity; but, no doubt, it was an eccentricity on the right side.\nThe middle classes, firm in the triple brass of their respectability,\nrejoiced with a special joy over the most respectable of Queens. They\nalmost claimed her, indeed, as one of themselves; but this would have\nbeen an exaggeration. For, though many of her characteristics were most\noften found among the middle classes, in other respects--in her manners,\nfor instance--Victoria was decidedly aristocratic. And, in one important\nparticular, she was neither aristocratic nor middle-class: her attitude\ntoward herself was simply regal.\nSuch qualities were obvious and important; but, in the impact of a\npersonality, it is something deeper, something fundamental and common to\nall its qualities, that really tells. In Victoria, it is easy to discern\nthe nature of this underlying element: it was a peculiar sincerity. Her\ntruthfulness, her single-mindedness, the vividness of her emotions and\nher unrestrained expression of them, were the varied forms which this\ncentral characteristic assumed. It was her sincerity which gave her at\nonce her impressiveness, her charm, and her absurdity. She moved\nthrough life with the imposing certitude of one to whom concealment was\nimpossible--either towards her surroundings or towards herself. There\nshe was, all of her--the Queen of England, complete and obvious; the\nworld might take her or leave her; she had nothing more to show, or to\nexplain, or to modify; and, with her peerless carriage, she swept along\nher path. And not only was concealment out of the question; reticence,\nreserve, even dignity itself, as it sometimes seemed, might be very well\ndispensed with. As Lady Lyttelton said: \"There is a transparency in her\ntruth that is very striking--not a shade of exaggeration in describing\nfeelings or facts; like very few other people I ever knew. Many may be\nas true, but I think it goes often along with some reserve. She talks\nall out; just as it is, no more and no less.\" She talked all out; and\nshe wrote all out, too. Her letters, in the surprising jet of their\nexpression, remind one of a turned-on tap. What is within pours forth\nin an immediate, spontaneous rush. Her utterly unliterary style has at\nleast the merit of being a vehicle exactly suited to her thoughts and\nfeelings; and even the platitude of her phraseology carries with it a\ncuriously personal flavour. Undoubtedly it was through her writings that\nshe touched the heart of the public. Not only in her \"Highland Journals\"\nwhere the mild chronicle of her private proceedings was laid bare\nwithout a trace either of affectation or of embarrassment, but also in\nthose remarkable messages to the nation which, from time to time, she\npublished in the newspapers, her people found her very close to them\nindeed. They felt instinctively Victoria's irresistible sincerity, and\nthey responded. And in truth it was an endearing trait.\nThe personality and the position, too--the wonderful combination of\nthem--that, perhaps, was what was finally fascinating in the case. The\nlittle old lady, with her white hair and her plain mourning clothes,\nin her wheeled chair or her donkey-carriage--one saw her so; and\nthen--close behind--with their immediate suggestion of singularity,\nof mystery, and of power--the Indian servants. That was the familiar\nvision, and it was admirable; but, at chosen moments, it was right that\nthe widow of Windsor should step forth apparent Queen. The last and the\nmost glorious of such occasions was the Jubilee of 1897. Then, as\nthe splendid procession passed along, escorting Victoria through the\nthronged re-echoing streets of London on her progress of thanksgiving\nto St. Paul's Cathedral, the greatness of her realm and the adoration\nof her subjects blazed out together. The tears welled to her eyes, and,\nwhile the multitude roared round her, \"How kind they are to me! How kind\nthey are!\" she repeated over and over again. That night her message flew\nover the Empire: \"From my heart I thank my beloved people. May God bless\nthem!\" The long journey was nearly done. But the traveller, who had\ncome so far, and through such strange experiences, moved on with the\nold unfaltering step. The girl, the wife, the aged woman, were the same:\nvitality, conscientiousness, pride, and simplicity were hers to the\nlatest hour.\nCHAPTER",
