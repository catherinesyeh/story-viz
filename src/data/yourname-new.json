I'd never seen the\nstyle of uniform she was wearing. Her expression was serious, even grave, as\nif the fate of the universe rested in her hands.\nStill, it was just a dream. It doesn't mean anything. By the time I think about\nit, I can't even remember her face. The echoes in my ears are already gone,\ntoo.\nEven so.\nEven so, my pulse is still racing abnormally fast. My chest is weirdly\nheavy. I'm sweaty all over. For the moment, I draw a deep breath.\nHaaaah...\nDo I have a cold? My nose and throat feel funny. My airways are a little\ntighter than usual. My chest...really is weirdly heavy. How do I put this?\nPhysically heavy. I look down at my body and see cleavage.\nCleavage.\nThe soft mounds reflect the morning sun, and the pale, smooth skin gleams.\nA deep-blue shadow lies between the two breasts, like a lake.\nMight as well squeeze 'em , I think, without missing a beat.\nMy hands gravitate toward them as naturally as an apple falling to the\nground.\n. ?\n...!\nThe sensation blows my mind. Whoa, I think. What is this? I keep kneading\nearnestly. This is just... Wow... Girls' bodies are amazing...\n\"Sis? What're you doin'?\"\nI glance in the direction of the voice. There's a little girl standing there.\nShe's just opened a sliding door. With my hands still pressed against my chest,\nI give her my honest impression.\n\"I was just thinking these feel way real... Huh?\"\nI look at the kid again. She's about ten, with twin ponytails and sharp eyes,\nand she looks like the sassy type.\n.. 'Sis'?\" I ask the girl, pointing at myself.\nSo that means this is my kid sister? The girl looks thoroughly appalled.\n\"You still asleep or somethin'? It's. Break. Fast. Time! Hurry up!\"\nShe slams the sliding door shut with a sharp thwack. Fierce little girl, I\nthink, hauling myself off the futon. Come to think of it, I am hungry. Suddenly, a\nfull-length mirror in the corner of my vision catches my eye. I walk a few steps\nacross the tatami mats decorating the floor to stand in front of it. Letting my\nloose nightshirt slip off my shoulders and fall to the floor leaves me naked. I\nstare at my full-length reflection in the mirror.\nLong black hair flows down my back, although it's sleep-tousled and\nsticking up in places. A small, round face holds big, curious eyes and lips that\nseem vaguely amused above a slim neck, deep collarbone, and a swelling\nbosom that seems to proclaim, Why yes, thank you, Fm quite healthy! Below\nare faint shadows of ribs, and then the soft curves of the waist.\nI haven't seen one in the flesh yet, but this is definitely a girl's body.\n...A girl?\nI'm...a girl?\nAbruptly, the drowsy fog enveloping my body is gone. My head clears\ninstantly, then plunges into confusion.\nI can't take it, and I scream.\n+ + +",

This place, Itomori, is a\ndinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either\nknow each other or at least know someone in common.\n\"Here are the morning announcements from Itomori.\"\nThe slow stream of words from the speaker is clipped into phrases. \"Here\nare...the morning anno uncements... from Itomori.\" There are speakers\noutside, too, all over town, so the broadcast echoes off the mountains and\noverlaps with itself as if it's being sung in rounds.\nTwice a day, morning and evening, this disaster-prevention radio broadcast\nplays throughout the town. Every house has a receiver to faithfully relay the\ndaily announcements about local events: the schedule for the sports meet, how\nto contact whoever's in charge of shoveling the snow, yesterday's births,\ntoday's funerals.\n\"With regard to the Itomori mayoral election, which will take place on\nthe twentieth of next month, the town election management committee\nhas\u2014\"\nClick.\nThe speaker over the lintel falls silent. Gran can't reach it herself, so she's\npulled the plug. She's past eighty and wearing her usual traditional kimono, but\neven so, the gesture wordlessly conveys her anger. Even as I'm impressed by\nher chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.\nPicking up where Saya's sister left off, the smiling NHK news lady starts\nspeaking.\n\"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only\nonce every twelve hundred years. For a few days, the comet is expected to be\nvisible to the naked eye. With the celestial show of the century just around the\ncorner, JAXA and research institutes worldwide are scrambling in preparation\nto study it.\"\nThere's a line of text on the screen \u2014Comet Tiamat visible to the naked\neye next month \u2014and a blurry picture of a comet. Our conversation has lost its\nmomentum, and the only noise comes from the three of us taking our meal and\nthe NHK broadcast. Our soft clinks and clicks sound a bit guilty, like\nwhispered chatter during class.\n\"... Just make up with him already, wouldja?\"\nOut of nowhere, Yotsuha says something tactless.\n\"It's an adult problem,\" I snap at her.\nThat's right\u2014this is an adult problem. Stupid election! Somewhere in the\nwind, a black kite gives a rather silly-sounding cry: Piiihyororo.",

Don't be stingy!\"\n\"C'mon, you're heavy.\"\n\"And you're rude!\"\nThis early in the morning, and they're already teasing each other like a\nmarried couple in a comedy skit.\n\"You two get along so well.\"\n\"We do not!\" they chorus.\nThey deny it so earnestly it's funny, and I giggle. My mental soundtrack\nswitches over to a jaunty guitar solo. The three of us have been friends for a\ngood ten years\u2014petite Saya, with her braids and straight-across bangs, and\ntall, skinny Tesshi with his burr cut and general lack of style. They always look\nlike they're fighting, but given how their conversation is always perfectly\nsynced, I secretly think they might make an excellent couple.\n\"Oh, Mitsuha, you did your hair properly today.\"\nSaya, who's gotten off the bike, touches the area around my hair cord,\ngrinning. My hair's fixed the same as always: two braids looped up and tied\ntogether in the back with the cord. My mom taught me how, a long time ago.\n\"Huh? What about my hair?\"\nHer comment sparks a recollection of the comments that sort of got lost in\nthe shuffle at breakfast. I did it \"properly\" today\u2014does that mean it was weird\nyesterday? As I'm trying to remember what happened, Tesshi leans in, looking\nconcerned. \"Hey, you did get your grandma to exorcise you, didn't you?\"\n\"Exorcise?\"\n\"Yeah, I swear you got yourself possessed by a fox!\"\n\".. .Excuse me?\" I frown at the unexpected remark.\nSaya speaks up for me, sounding disgusted. \"Would you quit blamin'\neverythin' on the occult already?! Mitsuha's probably just stressed, that's all.\nRight?\"\nStressed?\n\"Huh? Wait, hold it\u2014what's all this about?\"\nWhy is literally everybody worried about me? Yesterday was... I can't\nremember off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure it was just a regular day.\n...Hmm?\nWait, was it really? Yesterday, I...\n\"\u2014And most importantly!\"\nA deep voice from a megaphone erases my questions.\nOn the other side of the road, with its rows of vinyl greenhouses, a little\ncrowd of a dozen or so people is gathered in the ridiculously big municipal\nparking lot. Standing at its center, holding a microphone, is my dad, taller and\nbolder-looking than the rest. The banner he wears diagonally across his suit\njacket proudly proclaims, Incumbent\u2014Toshiki Miyamizu. He's stumping for\nthe mayoral election.\n\"Most importantly, economic revitalization, in order to sustain the\nvillage restoration project! Only when we have made that a reality will we\nbe able to establish a safe, worry-free community. As the incumbent, I\nintend to refine the community planning I've been involved with and see it\nthrough to completion! I will lead this region with new enthusiasm,\ncreating a local society in which everyone\u2014from our children to our senior\ncitizens\u2014can relax and enjoy fulfilling, active lives. I have renewed my\nresolve to make this vision my goal...\"\nIt's such a skillful speech that it's almost overbearing. It leaves me cold\u2014\nthis campaign address sounds like it belongs on TV, not in a parking lot\nsurrounded by fields. The whispers I hear from the crowd\u2014 \"You know it's\ngonna be Miyamizu again this term anyway, \" \"It sounds like he s been\nspreadin ' lots of cash around\" \u2014make my mood even darker.\n\"Hey, Miyamizu.\"\n\"...Mornin'.\"\nWonderful. The greeting comes from three classmates I'm less than fond of.\nEven in high school, they're part of the flashy \"in-crowd,\" and they snark at us\n\u2014the \"drones\"\u2014over every little thing.\n\"The mayor and the contractor,\" one of them says, shooting a deliberate\nglance at my orating father. When I follow suit, I see Tesshi's dad standing next\nto mine, beaming. He's wearing a jacket from his construction company and an\narmband that says Toshiki Miyamizu Supporter.\nThe guy looks back at me, then at Tesshi, and continues. \"Their kids are all\nbuddy-buddy, too. Did your folks tell you to hang out together?\"\nThis is so stupid. I don't even answer\u2014I walk faster, trying to get out of\nthere. Tesshi's expressionless. Only Saya looks bothered and a bit flustered.\n\"Mitsuha!\"\nSuddenly, a loud voice booms out. Yeep! My breath catches in my throat. I\ndon't believe this. My dad lowered his mic midspeech to shout at me without\nthe aid of electronic amplification. The whole crowd turns to look at me.\n\"Mitsuha, straighten up!\"\nI turn beet red. It's so unfair that I almost start crying. I want to run, but I\ndesperately fight back the urge and stride away instead.\nThe crowd is whispering. \"He's even tough on family.\"\n\"That's the mayor for you.\"\nI hear my classmates snickering. \"Ooh. Harsh.\"\n\"I kinda feel a little sorry for her.\"\nThis could not be worse.\nThe background music that was playing in my head a minute ago has\ndisappeared, and I remember that this town, without a soundtrack, is an\nabsolutely suffocating place.",

It's a window when outlines blur,\nmaking it hard to tell who people are. When you might meet something that\nisn't human. It's a time when people encounter demons or the dead, and it has\nanother name that reflects this.

I know twilight, of\ncourse, but the word I've heard people use to mean evening ever since I was\nlittle is half-light. When Miss Yuki hears this, she smiles gently.

I hear the elderly people in Itomori\nstill use ancient Japanese words here and there.\"\n\"'Cause this here's the sticks,\" proclaims one of the boys, and people start\ngiggling. He's not wrong. Sometimes Gran uses words that make me want to\nask her what language she's speaking. Some of her expressions were\nabandoned by most of the rest of Japan a couple of centuries back. Idly\npondering, I flip through my notebook, and then\u2014on a page that should be\nblank\u2014I see something written in big letters:\nWho are you?\n...Huh?\nWhat is this?

Why, oh\nwhy, in this tiny little town, do I have to have a father who's the mayor and a\ngrandmother who's the chief Shinto priestess at the shrine?

The meanin ' in those shapes is bound to resurface someday. Here,\nat Miyamizu Shrine \u2014\n\"Here, at Miyamizu Shrine, that's our solemn duty. And yet...\"\nAt that point, Gran lowers her mild eyes, sadly.\n\"And yet, that foolish son of mine... As if abandonin' the priesthood and\nleavin' this house weren't enough, he had to become a politician...\"\nGran sighs, and I sneak a small sigh of my own underneath it. Even I don't\nreally know whether I love this town or hate it, whether I want to go\nsomewhere far away or stay with my family and friends forever. When I\nremove my finished, brightly colored cord from the round stand, it makes a\nsoft, lonely click.\nI think the sound of the wooden Japanese flute that drifts from the shrine in the\ndarkness would probably terrify city folks. It sets the mood for some sinister\nevent, like in an old murder mystery novel. For a little while now, I've been\nperforming a ceremonial shrine maiden dance, feeling gloomy enough that I\nwish a killer like Jason or Jack the Ripper\u2014anybody really\u2014would just put\nme out of my misery.\nThis time every year, the Miyamizu Shrine holds its harvest festival, and\nYotsuha and I have the misfortune of being the stars of the show. On this day,\nwe wear crisp shrine maiden outfits, paint on bright-red lip rouge and wear\njingly hair ornaments, go out in front of the standing audience at the kagura\nhall, and dance the dance Gran taught us. It's one of the traditions whose\nmeaning was lost in the fire, and it's performed by two people, moving in sync.\nWe're both holding bells with colorful cords tied to them. We ring them,\ntwirling around and around, making the cords flare out and trail behind us.\nDuring my last spin, I spotted Tesshi and Saya out of the corner of my eye and\ngot even more depressed. Those little\u2014 I told them and told them not to come,\nand they're still here?! I'll hex them with my shrine maiden power! I'll text\nthem tons of curse stamps with Line! That said, the dance isn't the part I hate.\nSure, it's a little embarrassing, but since I've been doing it since I was little,\nI'm completely used to it. No, it's not this. It's that one ritual. The one that's\nmore embarrassing the older I get. That thing I have to do right after this. The\npart that seems intentionally designed to brutally humiliate women.\nOh, for the love of\u2014",

And seriously, doing it in shrine maiden clothes is just over the top!\nI mean, what's the point?! Mentally sniffling, I pick up another pinch of rice\nand put it in my mouth like a trooper. Then I chew again. Yotsuha is doing the\nexact same thing, her expression cool and composed. We have to do this over\nand over until the tiny boxes are full. Dribble... I spit saliva and rice again.\nInside, I'm crying my eyes out.\nAbruptly, my ears catch familiar voices. Feeling a bad premonition like a\nfaint ripple, I raise my eyes ever so slightly.\nCurses.\nI want to explode and take the shrine with me. I knew it: It's my three flashy\n\"in-crowd\" classmates.

And\nanyway, what's got you so shook up?\"\n\"It must be nice being a carefree, prepubescent little kid!\"\nI glare at Yotsuha. We've changed into T-shirts and just left the shrine office\nentrance.\nAfter the harvest festival, to close out the night, the two of us attended a\nbanquet for the local men and women who helped with the festival. Gran was\nthe hostess, and Yotsuha and I poured sake and made conversation.\n\"How old are you now, li'l Mitsuha? What?! Seventeen?! I see... Havin'a\nsweet young thing like you pour for me makes me feel young again. \"\n\"Yessir, go on and roll the years way back! Here, go ahead\u2014drink some\nmore!\"\nWe entertained almost desperately, wore ourselves out, and they finally\nturned us loose just now, saying, \"You kids can go on home.\" Gran and the\nother adults are still at the shrine office, carrying on with the banquet.\n\"Yotsuha, do you know what the average age was back there, in the office?\"\nOn the grounds, all the lights on the shrine approach are out, and the cool\nsounds of insect songs echo all around us.\n\"I dunno. Sixty?\"\n\"I did the math in the kitchen. It was seventy-eight. Seventy-eight!\"\n\"Huh.\"\n\"Now that we're gone, it's ninety-one in there! They're pushin' a hundred.\nThey're in the final stage of life. The underworld might send a reaper for the\nwhole place!\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that we should bail on this town ASAP, but\nYotsuha's response is terse. She seems preoccupied with something else. Well,\nshe's just a little kid. She wouldn't understand her big sister's agony. Giving\nup, I look at the sky. The vast expanse of it is filled with dazzling bright stars,\nshining transcendentally, as if human lives on Earth are none of their concern.\n\"...That's it!\"\nAs we descend the shrine's long stone stairway, side by side, Yotsuha\nsuddenly cries out. She's wearing a triumphant expression, as if having found a\ncake someone hid from her.\n\"Sis, why don't you chew up a whole bunch of that sake and use it to pay\nyour way to Tokyo?!\"\nFor a moment, I'm speechless.\n\".. .You've got quite the mind to come up with that.\"\n\"You could send snapshots and 'makin' of' documentary videos with it and\ncall it 'Shrine Maiden Sake' or somethin'! I bet that'd sell!\"\nShould I be worried that my nine-year-old sister sees the world like that?\nStill, I realize Yotsuha is actually concerned about me, in her own way. Aw, she\nreally is cute, I think, a little more fondly than before. Okay then, maybe I'll\ngive this sake business idea some serious thought... Wait, can you just sell\nsake on your own like that?\n\"Well? What do you think, Sis?\"\n\"Hmm...\"\n.. .And that's all I have to say.\n\".. .Wait, no! It'd be against the liquor laws!\"\nWait, was that the problem? I wonder, and when I come back to myself,\nI've broken into a run. All sorts of incidents and feelings and prospects and\ndoubts and despairs are jumbled together inside me, and it feels like my heart's\nabout to explode. I run down the steps, taking them two at a time, slam on the\nbrakes under the torii gate on the landing, and suck in a huge lungful of chilly\nnight air. Then I expel the cluttered mess in my chest along with it.\n\"I'm sick of this town! I'm sick of this life! Make me a hot guy in Tokyo in\nmy next life, puhleeeease!\"\nEeease. Eeease. Eeease. Eeease...\nMy wish echoes around the dark mountains, then disappears as though\ndrawn into Itomori Lake below me. The words came out on impulse, and\nthey're so dumb, my head cools right down, as does my sweat.\nOh, but even so.\nGods, if you're really there...\nPlease\u2014\nEven if the gods really do exist, I still don't know what to wish for.",

The eyebrows are stubborn-looking, but\nhis eyes are on the wide side and make him seem like a bit of a pushover. His\nchapped lips seem completely unacquainted with the concept of moisturizer,\nand his neck looks stiff. His cheeks are lean, with clean lines, and for some\nreason, there's a big bandage on one of them. When I touch it gingerly, there's a\ndull throb.\n\u2014But. Even though it hurts, I don't wake up. My throat is bone-dry. I twist\nthe faucet, fill my hands with tap water, and drink. It's unpleasantly warm and\nsmells like chemicals, like pool water.\n\"Taki, are you up?\"\nAbruptly, a man's voice calls from somewhere in the distance, and I give a\nlittle shriek of alarm. Taki?\n\"Breakfast was your job today, kid. Remember? You overslept.\"\nNervously, I peek into what looks like a living room. As he speaks, a\nmiddle-aged man in a suit glances at me, then immediately returns his attention\nto the dishes.\n\"I-Tm sorry!\"\nI apologize out of habit.\n\"I'm heading out. There's miso soup\u2014go ahead and finish it off.\"\n\"Um, yessir.\"\n\"And go to school. Even if you're late.\"\nOn that note, the man briskly piles up the dishes, puts them in the small\nkitchen, passes by me as I stand petrified in the doorway, goes to the foyer,\ndons his shoes, opens the door, steps out, and shuts it behind him. It all happens\nso fast there'd have been barely enough time for a kite to call once.\n\".. .What a weird dream,\" I say out loud.\nI take another look around the room. There are photos and design sketches\nof bridges and buildings and structures all over the walls. The floor is a\ncareless mess of magazines and paper bags and cardboard boxes. Compared to\nthe Miyamizu house, tidy as a venerable old Japanese inn (all thanks to Gran),\nthis place seems wild and lawless. The room is really small\u2014probably a\ncondominium.

The sky is a\nvivid cerulean blue, without the slightest blemish. On the border between the\nblue and green, ranks of buildings of all sizes line up neatly, like extra-intricate\norigami. Each and every one is stamped with minute, exquisite windows like\nthe mesh of a net. Some of the windows reflect blue, others are tinted green,\nand still others simply glitter in the morning sun. I can see a red tower, tiny\nwith distance, and a silver building whose rounded lines remind me vaguely of\na whale, and a shining black building that looks as though it's been cut from a\nblock of obsidian. I'm sure these buildings and several of the others are\nfamous\u2014even I recognize some of them. Far away, little toy cars flow in neat,\norderly lines.\nIt's the scenery of the biggest city in Japan, and compared with what I'd\nimagined, it's\u2014 Actually, come to think of it, I've never really tried to\nvisualize what it would be like before, but it's much, much more beautiful than\nit looks in the movies and on TV It hits me hard, right in the chest.\n\"Tokyo,\" I murmur.\nThis world is far too dazzling. I inhale deeply and squint, as if looking at\nthe sun.\n\"Hey, where'd you buy this?\" \"In Nishi-Azabu, on the way home from\nlessons.\" \"Guess who's gonna be opening for their next big concert?\" \"Yo,\nwanna skip club today and go catch a movie?\" \"An agency employee is coming\nto the mixer tonight.\"\nWh-what's with these conversations?

Maybe they're just reading posts off some celebrity's\nFacebook page?\nI watch the classroom from where I'm standing, half-hidden behind the\ndoor, timing my entrance. I used my smartphone's GPS to get here, and even\nthen, I got incredibly lost. By the time I found the school, the lunch bell was\nalready chiming away.\nStill, this school\u2014 Glass windows that take up entire walls, bare concrete,\ncolorful iron doors with round windows... It's so abnormally fancy, I have to\nwonder whether it's a World Expo venue or something. This Taki Tachibana\nguy, a boy my age, lives in a world like this? I think of his name, which I found\nin his student handbook, and his smug expression on his ID photo. They annoy\nme a little.\n\"Taaaki!\"\nSomebody abruptly throws an arm around my shoulders from behind, and I\ngive a wordless yelp. When I look, a bespectacled CEO-type (only neat and\nsophisticated) is smiling at me, close enough that our bangs are almost\ntouching. Eeeeeek! 'Scuse me, mister\u2014this is the closest I've ever been to a\nguy in my life!\n\"Look at you, showing up at noon. Let's go eat.\"\nWith that, the kid with glasses sets off down the hall, still hugging my\nshoulders. No, seriously, you're way too close!\n\"Ignore my text, will you?\" he accuses, but he doesn't sound mad. Then I\nfigure it out.\n\".. .Excuse me... Wait, Tsukasa?\"\n\"Ha-ha, 'excuse me'? Do I detect a note of contrition?\"\nI don't know how to respond to that, so for the moment, I quietly extricate\nmyself from his arm.\n\"...Yougot lost?\"\nTakagi\u2014a big, good-natured guy\u2014shouts, not bothering to hide his\nastonishment.\n\"How the heck did you manage to get lost on the way to school?\"\n\"Um...\" I falter. The three of us are sitting in a corner of the wide rooftop.\nIt's supposed to be lunchtime right now, but there aren't many people around.\nMaybe they're avoiding the summer sun.\n55\n\"Oh, um, 'scuse me\u2014\n'\"'Scuseme'?\"\nTakagi and Tsukasa eye each other dubiously. Oops, that's right: I'm Taki\nTachibana now.\n\"Uh, I mean, um... Oh. Pardon me...?\"\n\"Hunh?\"\n\"Sorry.\"\n\"Say what?\"\n\".Whatever?\"\nUh-huh, they nod, still looking bewildered. I see, so he's the \"whatever\"\ntype. Got it!\n\"I was just enjoyin' myself a little. Tokyo's kinda like a festival. Real\nlively.\"\n\".. .What's with the accent?\" asks Takagi.\n\"Huh?!\" I have an accent? I turn red.\n\"Taki, where's your lunch?\" Tsukasa prods.\n\"Huh?!!\" I didn't bring one!\nAs I hunt through my school bag, sweating bullets, they laugh. \"Do you have\na fever or something?\"\n\"Tsukasa, you got anything?\"\n\"Egg sandwich. Let's stick that croquette of yours in here.\"\nHere. The two of them hand me the improvised egg-croquette sandwich.\nTheir kindness touches my heart.\n\"Thank you...\"\nThey both grin at me wordlessly. To think boys could be so stylish and\nkind...!

They put serious effort into that.\"\nTsukasa and Takagi don't seem the least bit intimidated by this supremely\ntrendy space. They're smiling and discussing their impressions of the interior.\nApparently, these boys are touring different cafes because they're interested in\narchitecture. What kind of hobby is that?! Aren't high school guys into\nmagazines like MU7\\\n\"Taki, do you know what you want?\"\nPrompted by Tsukasa, I stop dissecting the cafe and let my eyes fall to the\nheavy, leather-bound menu.\n..! I\u2014I could live for a month on how much these pancakes cost!\"\n\"What era are you from, again?\" Takagi laughs.\n\"Umm...\"\nI stress about it for a little while and then remember: Oh. Right. This is a\ndream. Well, in that case, why not? It's Taki Tachibana's money anyway.

Move!\"\n\"Taki, you idiot, do your job!\"\n\"Taki!\"\nThe place is a dauntingly ritzy Italian restaurant.\nIt's a two-story building that's open all the way up, atrium-style. The\nceiling is hung with sparkling chandeliers, and there are big propellers up\nthere, too, spinning slowly. I've seen something like them in a movie. Taki\nTachibana is a bow tie-wearing waiter, and at dinnertime, the restaurant is\nhellishly busy.\nI'm being swept this way and that by a muddy torrent of confusion, getting\norders wrong, serving them wrong, getting tske d at by customers and yelled at\nby the chefs. Come on, people, I've never worked here before! Actually, I've\nnever worked a part-time job before, period! This is a total nightmare!\nWaaaah, seriously, when am I gonna wake up?! This is all your fault, stupid\nTaki Tachibana!\n\"\u2014'Scuse me. You. Boy.\"\n\"Huh? Uh, yes?!\"\nI've already gone a little ways past the customer who flagged me down,\nand I turn back hastily. How am I supposed to know to respond to \"boy,\" huh?\nWow. The man's an obvious thug, complete with open-collared shirt, gold\nchain, and lots of clunky rings. Still, if you go to the next city over from my\ntown, there are a lot of guys like him hanging out in front of the station. His\ntype feels a little more familiar to me than the celebrity-esque luster of the\nother customers. When he speaks, there's a thin smarm in his voice:\n\"Listen. There was a toothpick in my pizza.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nMr. Thug picks up the very last slice of basil pizza with his fingertips.\nThere's a toothpick sticking out of the edge where it was sliced, basically\nscreaming that someone jabbed it in there after the fact. Maybe he's joking\naround with me. I'm bewildered, unsure how to respond, and Mr. Thug\ncontinues with a seemingly fixed smile.\n\"It woulda been bad if I'd eaten that, right? We're just lucky I noticed it.\nWhat're you gonna do?\"\n\"Huh...?\"\nI get the feeling I really can't afford to say, You really stuck that in there\nyourself right, sir? I give a noncommittal smile instead... Conversely, his\nfades.\n\"I'm asking you what you're gonna do about it?!\"\nCrash! All of a sudden, he kicks the table up with his knee and starts\nyelling. Instantly, the murmur of conversation freezes. I tense up, too.\n\"\u2014Sir! Is something the matter?\"\nA woman appears and pushes me out of the way. She glances at me and\nwhispers, \"I've got this!\"\nSomeone else grabs my arm from behind and drags me away\u2014a waiter\nwho's probably worked there longer than me. \"You're acting pretty weird\ntoday,\" he says, looking concerned.\n\"I'm terribly sorry about that, sir!\" Out of the corner of my eye, I see the\nwoman bowing deeply to the thug.\nThe background hum returns, as if someone's twisted the volume backup.\nI'm pushing an industrial vacuum cleaner that's as big as a lawn mower\nover the floor. The restaurant's finally closed. The lights in the chandeliers\nhave dimmed, and all the tables have been stripped. One employee polishes\nglasses, another checks the stock in the refrigerator, and somebody else is\ndoing something with the computers at the cashier counter.\nThe woman who rescued me is wiping down the tables one by one. For a\nlittle while now, Fve been trying\u2014and failing\u2014to find an opportunity to speak\nto her. Her long hair has a soft wave to it. From the side, it hides her eyes, and\nI can't read her expression. Still, her lustrous, glossy lips are curved into a\ngentle smile. Her arms and legs are slender, and her waist is very small\u2014and\nyet she's got big boobs. She's just incredibly cool somehow. Passing her, I\ncatch a glimpse of the name tag on that proud bosom. It reads Okudera.\nPerfect!\n\"Miss Okudera?\"\nJust as I take the plunge and speak, somebody pokes me in the back of the\nhead.\n\"That's senpai to you!\" The guy who poked me sounds like he's joking. He\ngoes back into the kitchen, a stack of menus in one hand. I see, so she's got\nseniority on me. Okay!\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai! That was really...\"\n\"Taki. You had a rough day today, didn't you?\"\nAs she speaks, she turns and looks me right in the eye. Her long eyelashes\ncurve toward the ceiling, her perfectly shaped almond eyes are the epitome of\nbeauty, and her sexy voice sends a tickle down my back. I instinctively feel\ncompelled to tell her I love you! My cheeks flush a little, and I hastily look\ndown.\n\"Uh, no, it wasn't really 'rough,' just...\"\n\"That guy was totally full of it. I handled it according to the manual and let\nhim have his food for free, but...\"\nShe doesn't seem all that angry. She flips the rag over and starts wiping\ndown another table. Just as I'm about to try to prolong the conversation...\n\"Eek! Okudera-senpai!\"\nAnother waitress cries out.\n\"Your skirt!\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nMiss Okudera twists to inspect her rear, and her face rapidly flushes. Now\nthat I'm looking, I can see a rough, horizontal slash just above her thigh. With a\nshocked little shriek, she pulls her apron around to hide the tear.\n\"Are you hurt?\"\n\"Geez! Nasty. Was it that one dude?\"\n\"I think something like that's happened before...\"\n\"Was someone harassing you?\"\n\"Do you remember the guy's face?\"\nSeveral staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.\nEyes downcast, she's gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the\nwords I'd prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I\nsee little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.\nThis time, I need to rescue her.\nThe thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I'm doing,\nI've grabbed Okudera-senpai's hand and started walking. I hear voices at my\nback (\"Hey! Taki, you little...\"), but I ignore them.",

      "text": "By now, I've realized that Tokyo is filled with all sorts of scents.\nConvenience stores, family restaurants, the people I pass, the edge of the park,\nconstruction sites, the station at night, the inside of the train... Almost every ten\nsteps, the aromas change. I never knew human beings had such pronounced\nsmells when gathered in one place.\nAnd for every lighted window that skims past my vision, there's a person\nliving in this city. My heart is strangely stirred by the ranks of buildings that\nstretch as far as the eye can see, by their dizzying numbers and the\noverwhelming weight of them, almost like a mountain range.\nTaki Tachibana is one of the residents here, too. Softly, I extend a hand\ntoward the boy reflected in the train window. His face annoyed me a little, but\nI guess I don't hate it. I'm starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy,\nas if he's a fellow soldier who endured this rough day with me. But you know\n\"Y'know, this is a really impressive dream, if I do say so myself.\"\nBack at his house, I throw myself onto the bed where I woke up this\nmorning.\nI'll tell Tesshi and Saya about all this tomorrow: Listen to this dream 1\nhad!

I bet I'm gonna be a manga artist\u2014or no, wait,\nI'm not so great at art, but I bet writin' novels would be a cakewalk. I'll\nprobably make a ton of money! You wanna be my roommates in Tokyo?\nFantasizing about this and grinning to myself, I roll over onto my back, pick\nup Taki Tachibana's smartphone, and start skimming through it with my\nfingertip. Oh look, he keeps a diary\n[9/7 Ate at KFC with Tsukasa and Co.] [9/6\nMovie in Hibiya] [8/31 Architecture Tour\u2014\nBayside Edition] [8/25 Payday!]\nAs I scroll backward through the headers, I'm impressed in spite of myself.\n\"He's real thorough.\" Then I tap the photo app. Most of the pictures are\nlandscapes. After those, the majority are of him with Tsukasa and Takagi.\nEating ramen together, going to the park together... They sure are close. A beet\nbowl place, a soba shop at the station, a trendy hamburger joint. The road\nhome from school. Sunset through the gaps between the buildings. His friends'\nbacks. Jet contrails in the sky overhead.\n\"Lucky him, livin' in Tokyo...\"\nAs I murmur, a yawn slips out. Starting to get sleepy, I go to the next photo.\n\"Oh, it's Okudera-senpai.\"\nThe picture is of her back as she's cleaning the restaurant window, and it\nfeels like a candid shot. In the next, she's noticed and turned to face the\ncamera, beaming and flashing a peace sign.\n...Maybe he likes Okudera-senpai , I think out of nowhere. It's bound to be\nunrequited, though. She's in college. To her, high school guys are still just kids.\nI sit up on the bed and create an entry in his diary app. Then I start typing in\neverything I experienced today. About how I made a lot of mistakes but\nconnected with Okudera-senpai at the end. About how, on the way home from\nwork, we walked from the restaurant to the station together. I capture all of it in\nthe entry, wanting to report it\u2014or brag about it\u2014to Taki Tachibana. Once I'm\ndone, I yawn again. Then, out of nowhere...\nWho are you?\nFor some reason, I remember the line scribbled in my Japanese notebook.\nVaguely, I can picture Taki Tachibana in my body, writing that note in my room\nin Itomori before he falls asleep. What a bizarre idea. Still, there's something\noddly persuasive about it. I take a felt-tip marker from the desk, and on the\npalm of my hand, I write:\nMitsuha\nYaaaawwn...\nThat's the third yawn. Unsurprisingly, today wore me out. It was a colorful,\nthrilling day. It feels as if I spent all of it getting pelted by a rainbow-colored\nshower. Even without background music, this world dazzled me from start to\nfinish. I imagine how startled Taki Tachibana's going to react when he sees the\nwriting on his hand, and, smiling a little, I fall asleep.",

Either way, not\ngood. I swallow hard, and the three of them start in on me in menacing tones.\n\"Taki, you scumbag, whaddaya think you're doing, getting a jump on us?\"\n\"You'd better have an excuse, weasel.\" \"You two left together yesterday,\ndidn't you?\"\n\"Huh... Wait, no way\u2014seriously?! I did? With Okudera-senpai?!\"\nMeaning that journal entry was real?!\n\"What happened with you two after that?!\"\n\"Uh, no, I.. .1 really don't remember much...\"\n\"Don't gimme that crap!\"\nJust as it looks like somebody's gonna haul me up by my shirtfront, a cool\nvoice echoes through the hall.\n\"Okudera, reporting for duty.\"\nOkudera-senpai arrives, her long, bare legs and the shoulders peeking out\nof her top gleaming in the light. She greets us with a smile, strappy sandals\nclicking pleasantly.\n\"Hello, everyone.\"\n\"Hi!\"\nShe's sort of an idol at this place, and confronted with her stunning\npresence, the four of us reply in unison. For a moment, we almost forget about\nour problem. Then Okudera-senpai turns back and looks right at me.\n\"Let's make it another good day. Okay, Taki?\"\nI can almost hear a heart symbol punctuating that sentence, so sweetly\ndelivered, followed by a wink sent my way before she disappears through the\ndoor. I turn so red, it's like somebody dumped boiling water over my head.\nThis is way too much. I want to go polish all the glasses in the restaurant until\nthey shine, right this minute.\n\".Hey. Taki.\"\nThe guys' voices are so dark it's as though they're resounding from the\ndepths of the Earth, and I come back to myself with a jolt.\n\u2014Not good. As the senior staff cross-examines me, almost wailing, I\nwonder:\nWhat's going on here? Are they pranking me? Is everybody in on it? ...\nNah, couldn't be. What'd I do while I was out of it?\nWhat the heck is \"Mitsuha \"?",

Who are you????\nThe letters are big and messy, written roughly with a super-thick Magic\nMarker, from my palm all the way up to my elbow.\n\"Sis, what is that?\"\nWhen I look up, Yotsuha's standing in the open sliding door. I make a face\nthat says, That's what I want to know.\nMy little sister's face replies, Well, it doesn't really matter.\n\"You're not feelin' up your boobs today, huh? Break! Fast! Time! Hurry\nup!\"\nShe shuts the sliding door with a sharp clack , just like always, and I watch\nher from my futon. Huh? Boobs? I'm \"not feeling them up today\"? ...Excuse\nme? My mind produces a gratuitous image of myself happily squeezing my own\nboobs... B-but that's so perverted and gross!\n\"Mornin'!\" I say as I enter the classroom.\nThe minute I do, all my classmates' eyes are on me. Eep! I give a little\ngasp. Wh-what? Trying to make myself small and inconspicuous, I cross to my\nseat by the window. I hear whispers.\n\"Miyamizuwas really cool yesterday, huh.\"\n\"Uh-huh. I didn't think she had it in her.\"\n\"Her personality's kinda changed, though, yeah?\"\n\"U-um, people are lookin' at me...\"\n\"Well, what did you expect? After what you pulled yesterday, they can't\nhelp it,\" says Saya.\n\"'What I pulled yesterday'?\" I ask, sitting down.\nSaya peers into my face, looking puzzled and worried.\n\u2014You know.. .durin' art yesterday, when we were sketchin' that still life.\nHuh? You really don't remember? Again? Honestly, Mitsuha, are you okay?\nYou and me were in the same group. We were supposed to be drawin' the vase\nand the apples\u2014y'know, the subject that doesn't make any sense. Except you\nsketched a landscape instead. Well, that bit doesn't matter. Anyway,\nMatsumoto's group was behind us, and they were talkin' nasty, the way they\nalways do.\nWhat, you want to know? Um, well, about the mayoral election.\nHuh? Details? Oh, you know, how the town administration is all just\nfigurin' out how to hand out subsidies, and it's the same no matter who does it,\nbut how there are \"some kids\" whose livelihood depends on it, et cetera.\nDumb stuff like that. When you heard them, you said, \"That's me they're talkin'\nabout, right?\" So I said I thought it probably was. I mean, if you ask me, I'm\ngonna answer, right? Then, Mitsuha, what do you suppose you did?\nYou seriously don't remember? You kicked the desk with the vase on it\nright toward Matsumoto's group! And with a great big grin on your face!\nMatsumoto and the others got scared, and of course, the vase broke, and the\nwhole class went dead quiet. Actually, you gave me the chills, too!\n\"Wh-wh-what in the world?\"\nI turn pale. After school, I run straight home. Yotsuha and Gran are in the\nliving room, drinking tea without a care in the world. Glancing at them out of\nthe corner of my eye, I run up the stairs, shut myself in my room, and open my\nclassics notebook. Who are you? it still reads. I turn a few more pages.\nMy skin crawls. Now there's a whole two pages filled with small letters in\nthe same handwriting. First, in big letters, Mitsuha Miyamizu. Then there are\nlots of question marks around it and bits of personal information about me.\nYear 2, Class 3 / Teshigawara friend, occult geek,\ndumb but a good guy / Sayaka \u00a3, friend, quiet, kinda\ncute\nLives with her grandma and her little sister Yotsuha /\nWay out in the sticks / Her dad is mayor / She's a shrine\nmaiden? / Sounds like her mom is dead / Her dad\ndoesn't live with them / Doesn't have many friends /\nHas boobs\nThen, in larger letters, What the heck is this life??\nI stare at the notebook. I'm trembling. The scenery of Tokyo shimmers in my\nmind, as faint as a rising haze. Cafes, a part-time job, guy friends, walking\nhome with someone...\nA corner of my heart catches the tail of an impossible conclusion.\n\"Is this...? Could we be...?\"",

I'll\nget to put in some more time on the cafe project I'm working on with\nTeshigawara after school. Yeah, and also\u2014\nI sit up on the futon and look down at my body.\nMitsuha's pajamas have gotten really conservative lately. She used to sleep\nin a baggy nightshirt without a bra. This morning, though, she's wearing\nunderwear that's kinda constricting and this shirt that's buttoned up all the way.\nThere's no telling when we're gonna swap, so she's being careful. Well, I get\nthat. I do. But.\nI reach for her breasts. This is my body today. Nothing wrong with\ntouching my own body, I think, just like always. Only. Except. But...\nMy hands pause, and I mutter quietly:\n\".. .Guess I shouldn't.\"\nThe sliding door rattles open.\n\".You really do like your boobs, don't you. Sis?\"\nThat's all the little sister says before closing the sliding door. I watch her\ngo.. .while kneading my breasts.\n.. .This is okay, right? From on top of her clothes. Just a little.\n\"Graaaaan. Why's the body of our shrine's god all the way out here?\"\nYotsuha whines.\nGran, who's walking in front of us, answers without turning around.\n\"Thanks to Mayugorou, I don't know, either.\"\nMayugorou?\n\".. .Who's that?\" I whisper to Yotsuha, who's plodding along next to me.\n\"Huh? Youdunno? He's famous.\"\nFamous? I don't really get how these relationships work in the country.\nThe three Miyamizu women\u2014me, the grandma, and Yotsuha\u2014have been\nhiking mountain roads for almost an hour already. Today, they tell me, we're\ntaking an offering up to the body of their shrine's god on top of the mountain.\nThese people are living in a folktale , I think, thoroughly impressed.\nThe sun shining through the canopy of maple leaves dyes them bright red.\nThe air is crisp and dry, and there's a strong scent of dead leaves in the\npleasant wind. October. Who knows when it happened, but it's full autumn in\nthis town now.\nCome to think of it, I wonder how old this old lady is.\nThe thought comes to me gazing at the small back ahead of me. Even on this\nmountain trail, she's wearing traditional clothes. She's a surprisingly strong\nwalker, but her back has a textbook stoop, and she's using a walking stick. I've\nnever lived with an old person, so I can't even begin to guess her age or what\nkind of shape she's in.\n\"Hey, Grandma!\"\nI break into a run, then kneel in front of her, offering my back. After all, this\nlittle old lady is raising Mitsuha and her sister, and she always packs us really\ngood lunches.\n\"Let me piggyback you. If you want...\"\n\"Oh, may I?\" Even as she speaks, she's happily lowering her weight onto\nmy back. I catch a distinct whiff of a mysterious fragrance I smelled once at\nsomebody else's house a very long time ago. For a moment, I get a strange,\nwarm feeling, as if this moment has happened before. The old lady weighs\nnothing.\n\"Grandma, you're way light\u2014 Whoa!\"\nThe moment I stand, the added cargo buckles my (Mitsuha's) knees.\nYotsuha hastily supports me, complaining, \"Come on, Sis!\" Come to think of it,\nMitsuha's body is pretty flimsy and thin and light, too. Moving through the\nworld this way.. .it's kinda amazing. The thought gets to me a bit.\n\"Mitsuha, Yotsuha.\"\nI hear the old lady's voice over my shoulder, sounding serene.\n\"Are you familiar with musubiT '\n\" MusubiT '\nYotsuha asks the question from beside me. She's hugging my backpack to\nher stomach. Below us, through the gaps between the trees, I can see the whole\nround lake. We've climbed pretty high. Mitsuha's body is all sweaty from\nclimbing with her grandma on her back.\n\"In the old language, our local guardian deity is called Musubi, 'creator of\nspirits.' It's a word with several very profound meanin's.\"\nGuardian deity? Where'd this come from all of a sudden? Still, the old\nlady's voice is like something out of the Manga Japan Folktales program, and\nit's oddly persuasive.\n\"Did you know?\" she starts again. \"Joinin' threads is called musubi. Joinin'\npeople is also musubi. The passage of time is musubi , too. They all use the\nsame word. It's a name for our god, and the god's power. It describes the\nbraided cords we make, divine acts, and the flow of time itself.\"\nI can hear the murmur of running water. Must be a stream around here, I\nthink.\n\"Cornin' together to form a shape, twistin' and tanglin', sometimes cornin'\nundone, breakin' off, then reunitin'. That's a braided cord. That's time. That's\nmusubi .\"\nWithout really meaning to, I visualize a stream of clear water. It runs up\nagainst rocks and splits, mingles with others, joins up again, and, seen as a\nwhole, it's all connected. I don't really understand what the old lady's saying,\nbut I feel as if I've learned something very important. Musubi. Even after I\nwake up, I'll make sure to remember that word. Sweat drips off my chin,\nfalling to the ground with a distinctive plop, and is absorbed into the dry\nmountain.\n\"Here, drink up.\"\nWe take a short break in the shade. The old lady hands me a thermos.\nIt's nothing big, just sweetened barley tea. Even so, it's shockingly good,\nand I drain two cups in a row. \"C'mon! Me too!\" Yotsuha pesters. This may be\nthe best drink I've ever had.\n\"That's another musubi.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nAs I hand the thermos to Yotsuha, I involuntarily look over at the old lady.\nShe's sitting at the base of a tree.\n\"Puttin' anythin' in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also\ncalled musubi. Did you know that? What you put in your body binds to your\nsoul, you see. And so, the offerin' we're makin' today is an important tradition\nmeant to connect the god and humans to each other, a custom that the Miyamizu\nfamily has observed for centuries.\"\nBefore I notice, the trees end, and the lake town below us\u2014now about the\nsize of a sketchbook\u2014is half-hidden beneath the clouds. When I look up, the\nwisps of cloud still overhead seem paper-thin, transparent and shining.\nThey're flowing rapidly into the distance and dissolving in the strong wind.\nWe're in a rocky area where only moss grows. We've finally reached the peak.\n\"I see it, I see it!\"\nYotsuha's skipping around. I catch up to her and follow her gaze. Ahead,\nthere's a crater-like basin about the size of an athletic field, as if the top of the\nmountain has been gouged out. The inside is a green, marshy area, and near its\ncenter stands a massive, solitary tree.\nI'd never even imagined a view like this one, and I stare.\nIt's almost like a natural floating garden. You'd never be able to see it from\nthe town. The boondocks are all kinds of awesome.\n\"This is the edge of the other side,\" the old lady says.\nWe've gone down to the basin floor, and there's a little brook flowing in\nfront of us. The big tree is beyond.\n\"Other side?\" Yotsuha and I say together.\n\"The hidden world, the next world.\"\nThe next world. Grandma's folktale voice strokes my back like a cold\nwind. My feet falter just a little. A sacred mountain, or a power spot, or a save\npoint\u2014whatever it is, the atmosphere saturating it really does seem to belong\nto some other world.\nThis better not be one of those places that doesn't let you leave once you go\nin.\n\"Yaaaay, it's the next world!\"\nYotsuha whoops and splashes across the little stream. Kids are really\nsomething, all dumb and full of energy. Well, the weather's nice, and the wind\nand the brook are both peaceful. I'd probably be embarrassed later if I got cold\nfeet over something like this. I take the old lady's hand so she won't get wet,\nand we cross the brook on the stepping-stones.",

      "text": "\"In order to return to our world...,\" the old lady begins, suddenly sounding\nsolemn, \"you two must leave behind what's most precious to you.\"\n\"Huh?!\" In spite of myself, my voice gets shrill.\n\"W-wait, Grandma\u2014don't say that after we're already here!\"\nThe old woman smiles at my protest, and her eyes squinch up. I can see the\ngaps where she's missing teeth, and it's really creepy.\n\"There's nothin' to fear. I meant the sake. Take it out,\" the old lady instructs,\nand both Yotsuha and I remove small urns from our backpacks. They're the\nkind of thing you tend to see on Shinto altars in people's houses. Made of\nglossy white ceramic, their rounded shapes are a few inches across, and they\nwiden into a pedestal at the base. The lids are sealed with braided cords, and I\ncan hear liquid splashing inside.\n\"Below the god's body,\" Grandma says, gazing at the enormous tree,\n\"there's a little shrine. Offer them there. That sake is half of you, you see.\"\nHalf of Mitsuha.\nI look at the urn in my hands. It's that special sake, the stuff she made by\nchewing up rice. This sake was made by \"binding\" rice and this body... And\nI'm the one offering it. Feeling awkward\u2014like I'm about to score a goal off a\npass from someone I've been fighting with\u2014but at the same time strangely\nproud, I start toward the great tree.\nThis might be the first time I've heard real evening cicadas.\nI know what they are because it's the sound effect they always use for\nevening in movies and games. Their melancholy, wavering song echoes all\naround me\u2014everywhere\u2014and it makes this whole experience seem a lot more\nmovielike than an actual movie.\nThere's a loud rustling, and a flock of sparrows bursts out of the brush right\nin front of me. Having been under the impression that birds just hung out in\ntrees, I'm startled, but Yotsuha runs after them, twirling around and around. She\nlooks like she's having fun. We must be pretty close to the town\u2014there are\nfaint dinnertime smells on the wind. The idea that it's possible to so clearly\ndistinguish the scents of everyday human life surprises me a little.\n\"It's already half-light.\"\nHaving completed the day's formal business, Yotsuha sounds relieved, like\nshe's finally finished her homework. The evening sun lights up the girl and the\nold lady sidelong, like a spotlight. It's almost too picture-perfect.\n\"Whoa...!\"\nThe sight of the village coming into view below us makes me exhale\ndespite myself. I can see Mitsuha's entire town around the edge of the lake.\nBlue shadows have already engulfed the town itself, but the lake yawning\nbeside reflects the red sky. On the hillsides here and there, pink evening mists\nare gathering. Dinner smoke rises from several houses, trailing high and thin,\nlike smoke signals. The sparrows skimming through the air over the town\ngleam randomly, like motes of dust after school.\n\"Think we'll be able to see the comet soon?\"\nYotsuha is searching the sky, blocking out the setting sun with her palm.\n\"Comet?\"\nNow that she mentions it, I remember they were talking about something\nlike that on TV during breakfast, about how the comet's been close enough to\nbe visible to the naked eye for a few days now and how, just after sunset today,\nwe'd probably be able to see it if we looked diagonally above Venus.\n\"The comet...\"\nI say it aloud one more time. Out of nowhere, I feel as if I've forgotten\nsomething.\nI narrow my eyes, searching the western sky, and find what I'm looking for\nright away. Above Venus, which is especially bright, I see the comet's shining\nblue tail. In the depths of my memory, something's trying to surface.\nThat's right. Once before, I...\nThat comet\u2014\n\".. .My, my. Mitsuha.\"\nBefore I know she's there, Grandma's peering up at me\u2014into me. My\nshadow is reflected at the bottom of her deep black eyes.\n\"You're dreamin', aren't you?\"\n!\nAll of a sudden...\nI wake up.\nI've flung the sheet away, and it falls off the bed without a sound. My\nheart's pounding hard enough to raise my ribs (at least I think it is), but I can't\nhear my heartbeat. That's weird\u2014 But just after the thought forms, little by\nlittle, I start hearing my blood pumping. The morning sparrows outside the\nwindow, car engines, the rumble of trains. As if I'm finally remembering\nwhere I am, my ears begin taking in Tokyo.\n\"...Tears?\"\nI touch my cheek and find droplets of water on my fingertips.\nWhy? I don't know. I wipe my eyes with my palm. Even as I do, the twilight\nlandscape from a moment ago and the old lady's words are disappearing, like\nwater soaking into sand.\nTweedle.\nBy my pillow, my phone chirps.\nI'm almost there. I'm looking forward to today, r;\nIt's a Line message from Okudera-senpai.\nAlmost here? What's she talking about? .. .And then I gasp.\n\"Wait, did Mitsuha\u2014? Not again!\" Panicked, I dive into my phone and read\nMitsuha's memo. \"Adate?!\"\nI bolt out of bed and get ready at top speed.\nDate with Okudera-senpai in Roppongi\ntomorrow! She'll be waiting in front of Yotsuya\nStation at 10:30. It's a date I want to go on, but\nif I'm unlucky and it ends up being you, be\ngrateful and enjoy it.\nFortunately, the place where we're meeting is nearby. I sprint flat out and\narrive with ten minutes to spare. As I catch my breath, I check my phone to\nmake sure. Okudera-senpai might not be here yet. Even though it's a weekend\nmorning, the area around the station is still pretty lively.\nI wipe away my sweat, straighten my jacket collar, and mutter \"Mitsuha,\nyou idiot\" three times. Then, just in case, I start looking for Okudera-senpai.\n...I'm on a date with the Okudera-senpai. Not only that, but as it happens,\nthis is my first date ever. A first date with Okudera-senpai, who's like an idol,\nor an actress, or Miss Japan? Yeah, that's setting the bar fiendishly high.\nMitsuha, you moron. It's not too late yet, so I'm begging you, switch places\nwith me!\n\"Taaaki!\"\n\"Waugh!\"\nA voice startles me from behind, and I give a really lame yell. Hastily, I\nturn around.\n\"Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?\"\n\"No, I wasn't waiting! Uh, I mean, yes, I was! Or, no...\"\nWhat's with that question?! If I tell her I waited, I might make her feel bad,\nand if I tell her I wasn't waiting, I risk making her think I was late. Aaagh,\nwhat's the right answer?\n\"Urn, I, er...\"\nFlustered, I lookup. Okudera-senpai is standing right there, smiling at me.\nMy eyes go wide. She's in black mules, a white flared miniskirt, and a\nblack off-the-shoulder blouse. The monochrome outfit leaves her shoulders and\nlegs dazzlingly exposed, and several gold accessories have been placed\nstrategically, as if placing a careful seal on the charms of her skin. There's a\nlarge mocha-colored ribbon on her small white hat.\nShe looks incredibly sophisticated and incredibly pretty.\n\"...I just got here.\"\n\"Oh, good!\" she laughs, sounding chipper.\n\"Shall we?\"\nShe takes my arm... Ah, for a moment\u2014just a moment\u2014your breast\ntouched my arm. I have a sudden, immediate urge to polish every window in\nthis town.\n\"The conversation keeps dying...\"\nIn the bathroom, I'm hanging my head real, real low. I feel like smashing it\nagainst the mirror.\nThree hours into the date, and I'm already more exhausted than I've ever\nbeen in my life. I had no idea I was this bad with girls. No, that's not it. I hope\nthat's not it. It's all Mitsuha's fault for throwing me into this situation\nunprepared. And more than anything, it's Okudera-senpai's fault for being too\npretty.\nI mean, everybody we pass stares at her with their mouths hanging open.\nThen they see me walking beside her and give me the stink-eye, like they're\nthinking, What's that little punk doing there? That's what it looks like to me,\nanyway.\nWell, sure. Even I know I'm out of my league. Look, I didn't ask her out! I\nwant to go around grabbing people's shoulders and making excuses for myself.\nConsequently, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about. Okudera-senpai can\ntell and tries starting conversations with me, but that makes me insanely\nuncomfortable, which makes it even harder to talk. It's a vicious cycle.\nDammit, Mitsuha, what do you and Okudera-senpai usually talk about?!\nHoping for a lifeline, I open my phone and check Mitsuha's memo.\n...That said, I bet you've never been on a date before.\nAnd so, below, I've put together a collection of handpicked\nlinks, just for you!\n\"Whoa, seriously?!\"\nLook at that! She's practically a god! I open the links as if clinging to them\nfor dear life.\nLink 1: How I gots me a girlfriend even tho I has a\ncommunication disorder\nLink 2: Conversation skills for the person who's never, ever\nbeen the tiniest bit popular!\nLink 3: \\bu won't make 'em sick anymore! A feature on\ntexts they'll love\n.. .Somehow I get the feeling she's selling me way, way short.\nWalking through the art museum, I'm finally feeling a little relieved.\nI'm not particularly interested in the photo exhibit, which is titled\nNostalgia, but it's great to be somewhere it isn't weird not to talk. Okudera-\nsenpai is five feet ahead of me, strolling slowly, placidly gazing at the pictures.\nFurano, Tsugaru, Sanriku, Rikuzen, Aizu, Shinshu... The exhibition is\ndivided regionally, but all the rustic scenery looks the same to me. I don't\nknow the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can\nmake out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it's\nsummer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem\noddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you\ngo. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. \"Shibuya\nand Ikebukuro,\" for example, or \"Akasaka and Kichijouji,\" or \"Meguro and\nTachikawa.\"\nEven so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.\nThis one is different from the others.\nWell, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place\u2014the contours\nof the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red\nshrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick\nout your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I\nnever actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations\nwhen I was a kid, but that's what this feels like. I'm having a surreal, powerful\nsense of deja vu about the place. This is\u2014\n\"Taki?\"\nWhen I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a\nsecond, I forgot she existed.\n\"You know, Taki,\" she says with an even smile, \"you seem like a different\nperson today.\"\nShe executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me\nbehind.\nI blew it.\nAll I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole\nthing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn't even\nconsider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.\nEven though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who'd invited her. Even though I\nshould've been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I've\nspent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.\nFrom the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi\nbuildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.\nMy eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She's not saying a word.\nHer hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,\nshe might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat\ntighten. I feel like the oxygen's suddenly thinned, and it's hard to breathe. I\ngrope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai?\"\nShe doesn't turn.\n\".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere\u2014\"\n\"Why don't we call it a day instead?\" she suggests with the tone of a patient\nteacher.\n\"Okay.\"\nOn the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-\nsenpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun\n\u2014I can't see it clearly.\n\"Taki... Forgive me if I'm wrong, all right?\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"A long time ago, you liked me a little bit, didn't you?\"\n\"Huh?!\" She knew?! How?!\n\"And now there's someone else you like, isn't there?\"\n\"Huuuuuuuh?!\" I gush sweat as if Fve suddenly teleported into a tropical\nrain forest. \"N-no, there isn't!\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Th-there isn't! There's absolutely nobody like that!\"\n\"I wonder...\"\nOkudera-senpai examines my face skeptically. Somebody else I like? No,\nthere's nobody like that. Fm pretty sure there isn't. Just for a moment, her long\nhair and the softness of her breasts flicker through my mind but vanish almost\nimmediately.\n\"Well, never mind.\"\nHer tone is bright and clear, and her face recedes.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Thank you for today. I'll see you at work.\"\nOkudera-senpai flutters a hand at me, then simply walks away, leaving me\nbehind. Mechanically, I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. Even so, no\nwords come out, and while I'm doing that, Okudera-senpai's back descends\nfrom the pedestrian bridge and disappears into the crowd in front of the station.\nI gaze at the evening sun, feeling as if I've been abandoned on the edge of\nsummer. There are no breaks in the cars streaming under the pedestrian bridge,\nand after I've been listening to them for a while, I start feeling as though I'm on\na real bridge, over a river. The late sun is as weak as a flashlight, and it's\ndisappearing behind the water tank on top of a mixed-use building. I focus on it\nthe entire time, intently, as if trying to reclaim something.\nIt feels like there are other things I should be doing, but I can't think of\nanything specific. I just want to go to Mitsuha's town again, fast. Becoming\nMitsuha means talking to her, too. When we're swapped, at the same time,\nwe're connected in some special way. We're trading experiences. We're bound\ntogether the way her grandma was talking about. If I turn into Mitsuha, I think\nI'll be able to talk about what happened today. I want to joke around with her.\n\"That's why you're not popular, you know. \" \"It's your fault for promising\nstuff without checking first. \"\nI open the memo on my phone. There's more to Mitsuha's note.\nThe comet should be visible just about the time\nthe date ends.\nEeeeee, how romantic! I can't wait for tomorrow.\nV\nWhether it's me or you, let's do our best on the\ndate!\nComet?\nI look up at the sky. The last traces of the sunset are already gone. A few of\nthe brightest stars are out, and a jet's flying past, humming faintly, but that's it.\nNeedless to say, there's no comet.\n\"What's she talking about?\" I mutter quietly.\nIf a comet people could actually see was passing, it would've been pretty\nbig news. Maybe Mitsuha got mixed up.\nAbruptly, my heart twinges uneasily in its darkest recesses.\nSomething's trying to surface in my mind.\nI flip through the phone and pull up Mitsuha's cell number, staring at those\neleven digits. Back when we first started swapping, I tried calling this number\nseveral times, but for some reason, it never went through. I touch it with a\nfingertip. The \"calling\" sound plays. Then I hear a voice from the speaker:\n\"The number you have dialed is unavailable. Either the number is not in\nservice or the unit is turned off or out of range... \"\nI pull the phone away from my ear and press end call.\nSo calls really don't get through. Well, whatever. I'll just tell her about this\ntrain wreck of a day next time we swap. I'll ask her about the comet, too. We'll\nswitch tomorrow or the day after, anyway. With that thought, I finally descend\nthe pedestrian bridge. There's a pale, smooth half-moon overhead, all alone, as\nif someone forgot it there.\nBut after that, Mitsuha and I never swapped again.",

      "text": "\"Approaching Nagoya ,\" a lazy voice announces over the train's\nloudspeaker.\nThe exchanges with Mitsuha started out of the blue one day and ended just\nas suddenly. No matter how much thought I gave it, I couldn't figure out why.\nAfter several weeks, it got harder to shake the suspicion they might just have\nbeen a string of extremely vivid dreams.\nI've got proof, though. I can't believe that the journal entries Mitsuha left on\nmy phone came out of my own head. That date with Okudera-senpai could\nnever have happened if I'd been myself. I'm convinced Mitsuha's a real girl.\nHer body heat, her pulse, the way she breathes, her voice, the red light\ndawning over her closed eyes, the vibrant sounds in her ears\u2014I felt all of that\nmyself. Experiencing her life was so intense, it convinced me, If she isn't\nalive, then nothing is. Mitsuha is real.\nBecause of that, the abrupt way it ended is making me oddly uneasy.\nSomething might have happened to her. Maybe she came down with a fever.\nMaybe there was some sort of accident. Even if I'm overthinking things, at the\nvery least, she's bound to be worried about the situation, too. That's why I\ndecided to go see her in person. But...\n. .Excuse me? You don't actually know where she is?\"\nWe're in a four-person box seat on the express train Hida. Okudera-senpai\nsounds incredulous, stuffing her face with a box lunch she picked up at the\nstation.\n\"...Right.\"\n\"Your only clue is what the town looks like? You can't even contact this\ngirl? Are you kidding me?!\"\nI didn't ask her to come with me. How come I'm getting blamed? I look at\nTsukasa, willing him to say something. He does, swallowing a bite of miso\ncutlet.\n\"You are an abysmal tour planner.\"\n\"This isn't a tour!\"\nI lose it for a second. These two think they're on some kind of field trip. I\ncan read their expressions clearly. There's just no help for this child. Why are\nthey acting all superior, anyway?\n\"Well, never mind,\" Okudera-senpai says. Unexpectedly, she smiles,\nthrowing out her chest. \"Don't you worry, Taki. We'll help you look.\"\n\"Eeeee, it's so cuuuute! Taki, look at this, looook!\"\nAt the local station we finally reached after noon, Okudera-senpai gushes\nover the area's laid-back mascot. It's a full-body plush cow costume wearing a\nstation employee cap. The camera on Tsukasa's phone fires off click after click\nin the little terminal.\n\"You guys are in the way.\"\nAs I glare at the local map posted in the station, I'm even more convinced\nthat these two are going to be no help whatsoever. I'll just have to find her\nmyself.\nThe plan goes like this:\nSince I don't know exactly where Mitsuha's town is, we'll take the train to\na spot that seems close to the scenery in my memory. From that point, all we'll\nhave to go on will be the landscape sketches I drew. We'll go around showing\nthe drawings to residents, asking if anyone recognizes them, slowly working\nour way north along the local line. There's a railroad crossing in one of the\nscenes I remember, so following the tracks should work.\nIt's a really vague approach, to the point where I can't really call it a\n\"plan\" at all, but I couldn't think of any other way. Besides, there can't be that\nmany towns built around lakes. I'm convinced I'll probably find some kind of\nhint by tonight, though I've got no grounds for thinking that.\nPsyching myself up, I take a confident first step, heading out to talk to the\ndriver of the lone taxi parked outside the station.\n\".. .This isn't gonna work...\"\nI'm slumped at a bus stop, my head drooping.\nAll the confidence I had when we started asking around has completely\ncaved.\nAfter that first taxi driver gave me a blunt \"N-nope, dunno,\" we tried police\nboxes, convenience stores, souvenir shops, guest houses, diners, and everyone\nfrom farmers to grade-school kids, oblivious to how we probably looked, but\nour results were solidly negative. The fact that there was only one local train\nevery two hours made it hard for us to get around, so we thought we'd try\nasking people on the bus. We boarded in high spirits but were the only\npassengers. I didn't even feel like asking the driver at that point, and the last\nstop was way out in the middle of nowhere, with no houses anywhere in sight.\nThe whole time, Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai cheerfully made the most of their\nday trip, playing word games, cards, phone games, variations on rock-paper-\nscissors, and eating snacks. Eventually, they ended up on either side of me on\nthe bus, leaning against my shoulders and dozing peacefully.\nNow, as the two of them guzzle cola in front of the bus stop, I sigh. They\nhear it and react together.\n\"Oh, come on, Taki! You're giving up already?!\"\n\"What about all our hard work?!\"\nI heave another sigh, so deep it almost brings my lungs up with it. Okudera-\nsenpai's wearing oddly gung-ho clothes meant for serious hiking. In contrast,\nTsukasa's in chinos like he's just strolling around the neighborhood. At this\npoint, both outfits really irritate me.\n\"You guys have been zero help.\nThey both look innocent, as if to say, Oh, really?\n\"I'll have a Takayama ramen.\"\n\"One Takayama ramen here.\"\n\"Uh, okay, then I'll have the same, too.\"\n\"You betcha. Three ramen!\" says the middle-aged lady cheerily.",

      "text": "On our fruitless way to the next (abnormally distant) station, we found a\nramen shop that was miraculously open and made a beeline inside. When the\nlady wearing a triangular kerchief told us, \"C'mon in,\" her smile seemed a\nbeacon, not unlike the appearance of a long-awaited search party when you're\nlost.\nThe ramen's good, too. Contrary to its name, it's perfectly ordinary ramen\n(I thought it might have Hi da beef on top, but it was regular braised pork), but\nas soon as I eat the noodles and veggies, I can feel my body recharging. After\ndraining the soup bowl dry and drinking two cups of water, I finally take a\nbreather.\n\"Do you think we'll be able to get back to Tokyo today?\" I ask Tsukasa.\n\"Hmm... I don't know. We may be cutting it close. Want me to check?\"\nTsukasa apparently didn't expect this but nevertheless pulls out his phone\nand starts looking up how to get home.\n\"Thanks,\" I tell him.\n\"Taki, you're sure that's all right?\" Okudera-senpai asks.\nShe's across the table from me and hasn't finished eating yet. I'm not\nimmediately sure how to answer, so I look out the window. The sun's just\nbarely caught on the edge of the mountains, shining peacefully over the fields\nalong the prefectural highway.\n\"I can't explain it, but it's starting to feel like I'm on the wrong track,\" I\nmutter, half to myself. It might be better to go back to Tokyo and rework my\nstrategy. It would be one thing if I had photos, but expecting to find the town\nwith sketches like these might have been asking too much. At least, that's how\nit starts to seem when I pick up my sketchbook and gaze at it. It's a completely\nordinary country town, with the sort of houses you see everywhere scattered\naround a round lake. Even though it felt so solid to me when I finished drawing\nit, it looks like an anonymous, mediocre landscape now.\n\"That's old Itomori, ain't it?\"\n\"Huh?\" I turn around and see the lady's apron. She's pouring water into my\nempty cup.\n\"Did you draw that, son? Say, can I have a look?\" She takes the sketchbook\nfrom me. \"This is a real good picture. Hon, c'mere a sec!\"\nThe woman shouts back toward the kitchen. The three of us watch her,\nmouths agape.\nThe ramen shop owner comes out of the kitchen and considers the sketch,\nsmiling a little. \"Oh, yeah. That was Itomori, for sure. Takes me back...\"\n\"My man's from Itomori, you see.\"\nItomori?\nSuddenly, I remember. I start up out of my chair.\n\"Itomori... Yeah, Itomori! Of course, why couldn't I remember that? It's\nItomori! It's near here, isn't it?!\"\nThe couple looks mystified, exchanging perplexed glances. The man opens\nhis mouth.\n\"Kid... You know about Itomori, don't you? That's where\u2014\"\nTsukasa interrupts loudly. \"Itomori?! Taki, don't tell me\u2014\"\n\"What, wait\u2014? You mean, the one where the comet...?!\"\nEven Okudera-senpai speaks up, eyes wide.",

The shadow of something that's been trying to\nsurface in my mind this whole time rustles stealthily, growing more and more\nominous.\nThe cry of a kite trails through the atmosphere, lonely enough to freeze the\nblood.\nA row of Do Not Enter barricades extends as far as the eye can see,\nthrowing long shadows over the cracked asphalt.\nA sign with vines tangled around it reads, In accordance with the\nDisaster Countermeasures Basic Act, this area is off-limits. KEEP OUT.\n\u2014Reconstruction Agency.\nAnd below me lies Itomori, devastated by some unimaginable force and\nmostly swallowed up by the lake.\n\".. .Is this really the place?\"\nOkudera-senpai walks up behind me, her voice trembling. Without waiting\nfor me to respond, Tsukasa answers, sounding desperately cheerful.\n\"It can't be! Like I've been saying, Taki's confused.\"\n\"...This is it.\"\nI tear my eyes away from the ruins below me, scanning my surroundings.\n\"It isn't just the town. I remember this schoolyard, the mountains around us,\nthe high school... I remember all of it perfectly!\"\nI have to shout the words to convince myself. Behind us is the school\nbuilding, black and sooty, with some of its windows broken. We're standing on\nthe grounds of Itomori High School, looking out across the lake.\n\"So you're saying this is the town you were looking for? The one where\nyour friend online lives?\" Tsukasa shouts, that parched smile still clinging to\nhis voice.\n\"That's not even possible! That disaster was three years ago. Hundreds of\npeople died! You remember it, right, Taki?!\"\nAt that, I finally turn toward Tsukasa.\n\"...Died?\"\nI meant to look at his face, but my gaze goes right through him, then through\nthe high school behind him, only to dissipate into the distance. I know I must be\nlooking at something, but there's nothing there.\n\"Three years ago...she died?\"\nAbruptly, I remember.\nThe comet I saw over Tokyo three years earlier. Countless shooting stars\nfalling through the western sky. I thought it was beautiful, like something out of\na dream. I got all excited about it.\nThat's when she died?\nDon't.\nI can't acknowledge that.\nI search for words. For proof.\n\"That can't be true... I mean, look, I've got the journal entries she wrote.\"\nI retrieve my phone out of my pocket. Spurred on by the inane fear that the\nbattery will die forever if I take too long, I flip through it in a panic and pull up\nMitsuha's journal entries. They're really there.\nI rub my eyes, hard. For a moment, the letters seemed to writhe.\n\"Wha...?\"\nFirst one letter, then another.\nThe words Mitsuha wrote begin dissolving into meaningless symbols.\nBefore long, the text flickers like a candle flame, and then it's gone. One by\none, her entries disappear entirely. It's as though an invisible man is holding\ndown delete. As I watch, all her sentences vanish.\n\"Why...?\" I ask very quietly.\nThe kite's cry echoes again, high and distant.\nThree years ago in October, right around this time of year, Tiamat, a comet\nwith a solar orbital period of twelve hundred years, made its closest approach\nto Earth. It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put\nHalley's Comet's seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4\nbillion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly\nseventy-five thousand miles of Earth\u2014closer than the moon. The tail of this\nshining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first\ntime in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it\nwelcomed Comet Tiamat.\nUntil the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet's\nnucleus would split in Earth's vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in\ndiameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,\nplummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per\nsecond. Tragically, it struck Japan\u2014a residential area called Itomori.\nThe town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision\noccurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which\nmust have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.\nThe meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The\ndestruction wasn't limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge\nhole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,\nmagnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds\nlater, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater\npart of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the\ntown's population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in\nhuman history.\nSince the crater had formed right beside Itomori Lake, water rushed in,\nultimately creating a gourd-shaped body of water, New Itomori Lake.\nDamage to the southern side of the town was relatively light, but even the\nthousand or so residents who escaped injury moved away, one after another. In\nless than a year, the town was having trouble functioning as a municipality.\nFourteen months after the meteorite fell, for all intents and purposes, Itomori\nwas gone.\n\u2014These are textbook facts, and of course, I knew most of them already.\nThree years ago, I was in middle school. I remember actually watching Comet\nTiamat from a hill in my neighborhood.\n.. .But that's weird.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nI lived in Itomori as Mitsuha, several times, right up until last month.\nThat means that what I saw, the place where she lived, wasn't Itomori.\nThe comet and my swapping with Mitsuha had nothing to do with each\nother.\nIt'd be normal to think that. It's what I want to think.\nHowever, paging through books in this city library near Itomori, I'm\nhopelessly confused. For a while now, in the deepest corner of my mind,\nsomeone's been whispering, This is where you were.\nVanished Itomori\u2014Complete Records\nItomori\u2014The Village That Sank in a Night\nThe Tragedy of Comet Tiamat\nI flip through tome after tome with titles like these. The photos of bygone\ndays in Itomori unmistakably show places I've been. This is the grade school\nYotsuha goes to. Miyamizu Shrine is where their grandma is the chief priestess.\nThis pointlessly big parking lot, the two snack bars right next to each other, the\nconvenience store that looks like a barn, the little railroad crossing on the\nmountain road, and of course Itomori High School... At this point, I recognize\nall of them clearly. Seeing those ruined streets with my own eyes has\nsharpened my memories.\nIt's hard to breathe. My heart is struggling, beating irregularly, and refuses\nto calm down.\nIt feels as though the vivid photos are silently absorbing the air and any\nsense of reality.\nItomori High\u2014Final Sports Festival\nThe photo above the caption shows high schoolers in the middle of a three-\nlegged race. The pair on the end seems familiar. One has straight-cut bangs and\nbraids. The other girl's hair is bound up with an orange cord.\nThe air gets even thinner.\nI feel as though hot blood is oozing down the back of my neck, but when I\nwipe it away with my hand, it's transparent sweat.\nTaki.\"\nI look up. Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai are standing there. They hand me a\nsingle book. Foil letters in a weighty font are stamped on its thick cover:\nItomori Comet Disaster List and Catalog of Victims\nI turn the pages. The victims' names and addresses are given by district. I\nrun my finger down them. I keep turning pages. Finally, my finger stops on\nnames I recognize.\nTeshigawara, Katsuhiko (17)\nNatori, Sayaka (17)\n\"Teshigawara and Saya...\"\nAs I murmur, I hear Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai suck in their breath.\nThen I find the names that prove it all.\nMiyamizu, Hitoha (82)\nMiyamizu, Mitsuha (17)\nMiyamizu, \\btsuha (9)\nThe other two peer over my shoulder at the list.\n\"That's her.? It has to be some kind of mistake! I mean, she's\u2014\"\nOkudera-senpai sounds as if she might burst into tears. \"She's been dead for\nthree years.\"\nTrying to deny her words, I shout, \"Just two or three weeks ago, she\u2014!\"\nIt's hard to breathe. I inhale desperately and continue. This time, it comes out\nas a whisper. \"She told me we'd be able to see the comet.\"\nI somehow manage to tear my eyes away from the letters that spell out\nMitsuha.\n\"So...!\"\nWhen I raise my head, my face is reflected in the dark window in front of\nme. Who are you? I think, out of nowhere.\nFrom deep in my mind, very far away, I hear a hoarse voice. \"...My, my.\nYou 're \u2014 \"\n\"\\fou're dreamin', aren't you?\"\nA dream? I'm drowning in a wave of confusion.\nWhat...\n...inthe world...\n...ami doing?\n+ + +",

The atmosphere\nin the room, which had seemed cold and isolated, suddenly softens. I feel\nterribly relieved.\n\"Uh, Okudera-senpai?\"\nI get up from my chair. She's crouched down in front of her backpack.\n\"I've been saying all sorts of weird stuff... I'm sorry about today.\"\nZipping her backpack as if carefully sealing something away, Okudera-\nsenpai stands. Somehow she seems to move in slow motion.\n\".. .It's fine,\" she says, shaking her head with a faint smile.\n\"I'm sorry we could only get one room.\"\n\"Tsukasa said the same thing to me downstairs,\" Okudera-senpai chuckles.\nWe're sitting facing each other across the little table by the window.\n\"I don't mind a bit. They say a group just happened to be staying here\ntonight, so they don't have any rooms to spare. The man who runs the inn said\nit's a teachers' union social.\"\nThen she laughingly tells me how they treated her to Asian pears in the\nlounge after she got out of the bath. She's the sort of person who makes\neveryone want to give her something. The scent of the inn's shampoo reaches\nme, like a rare perfume from a distant, foreign land.\n\"Look at that. Itomori used to make braided cords. How pretty,\" Okudera-\nsenpai murmurs, flipping through a volume of local Itomori materials. It's one\nof the books I borrowed from the library.\n\"My mother wears kimonos sometimes, so we have several of these at\nhome. Oh, say...\"\nLifting my teacup, my hand pauses. She's examining my right wrist.\n\"That one on your wrist, Taki. Is that a braided cord?\"\n\"Oh, this is...\"\nI set the cup down on the table and consider my arm. This is my good-luck\ncharm: a vivid orange cord, thicker than a thread, wound around my wrist.\n...Huh?\nIsn't this\u2014?\n\"I think somebody gave it to me a long time ago. I wear it sometimes, for\ngood luck...\"\nThe deepest part of my mind prickles again.\n\"Who was it?\" I murmur.\nI can't remember.\nStill, if I follow this cord, it feels like I'll find something.\n\"...You, too, Taki.\"\nThe gentle voice makes me raise my head to see concern on Okudera-\nsenpai's face. \"Why don't you go take a bath?\"\n\"Abath... Right...\"\nBut almost immediately my attention returns to the braided cord. I feel as\nthough I'll lose something forever if I let go here, and I desperately ransack my\nmemories. The dinner party is over, though I don't know when it ended. The\nquiet song of autumn insects fills the room.\n\"Somebody who made braided cords told me something once.\"\nWhose voice is that? It's kind and hoarse and tranquil. Like something from\na folktale.\n\"They said that cords are the flow of time itself. They twist and tangle,\ncome apart and reunite. They said that's time. That's...\"\nA mountain in autumn. The sound of a brook. The smell of water. The taste\nof sweet barley tea.\n\"That's musubi \u2014\"\nThe scene bursts into my mind.\nThe body of the god on top of the mountain. The sake we offered to it.\n\"...That place...!\"\nI pull a map out from under the pile of books and open it. It's a map of\nItomori from three years ago that I found in a small independent shop, covered\nin dust. The topography from back when there was just one lake. The place\nwhere we offered the sake should be far outside the area the meteorite\ndestroyed.\nIf I go there... If that sake's there...\nI pick up my pencil, searching for a landform that looks likely. It was way\nnorth of the shrine, a place like a caldera. Desperately, I try to find something\nalong those lines.\nI might be hearing Okudera-senpai's voice, distantly, but by now, I can't\ntear my eyes off the map.\n...ki... Taki.\nSomebody's calling my name. It's a girl's voice.\n\"Taki, Taki.\"\nHer voice is earnest, pleading, as if she's about to cry. A voice trembling\nwith loneliness, like the glimmer of distant stars.\n\"Don't you remember me?\"",

      "text": "I wake up.\n...That's right. I'm at an inn. I've been sleeping slumped over the table by\nthe window. I can sense Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai beyond the sliding door,\nasleep on their futons. The room is strangely quiet. I can't hear any insects or\ncars. The wind isn't blowing, either.\nI sit up. The rustle of my clothes is loud enough to startle me. Outside the\nwindow, the world is just beginning to shake off the darkness.\nI look at the cord on my wrist. The faint echoes of the girl's voice linger in\nmy ears.\n\u2014Who are you? I ask. I don't even know her name.\nNaturally, there's no answer.\nBut, well, that's all right.\nOkudera-senpai and Tsukasa\u2014\nThere's a place I need to check, no matter what. Please\ngo back to Tokyo ahead of me. I'm sorry for being\nselfish. I swear I'll come back later. Thanks.\n\u2014Taki\nI write a note. As an afterthought, I take a five-thousand-yen bill out of my\nwallet and put it under a teacup along with the memo.\nWe've never met, but I'm about to come looking for you.\n+ + +\nHe's gruff and doesn't say much, but he's a really nice guy , I think, studying\nthe sinewy hands on the steering wheel beside me.\nIt's the man from the ramen shop. He's the one who took us to Itomori High\nSchool yesterday, and to the city library. I called him really early this morning,\nand he still did me a favor and brought the car over. If this hadn't worked, I\nwas planning to hitchhike, but I can't imagine any cars would've given me a\nride to a ruined, abandoned town. I'm seriously lucky I met this guy in Hida.\nFrom the passenger-side window, I have a view down to the edge of New\nItomori Lake. Half-demolished houses and broken asphalt languish in the\nwater. Even a good ways offshore, I can see telephone poles and iron beams\njutting out of the lake. It should be a very disconcerting sight, but I must have\ngotten used to seeing it on TV and in photos, because I start feeling as if the\nplace has always been like this. For that reason, I don't really know how to\nprocess what I'm seeing. Should I get mad, grieve, get scared, or lament my\nown helplessness? The reality of losing an entire town is probably too much\nfor ordinary people to get their heads around. I give up searching for meaning\nin the scene and turn my eyes to the sky. Gray clouds hang over our heads, as if\nthe gods have set an enormous lid there.\nWe travel north along the lake, and when the car can't go any higher, the\nman sets the parking brake.\n\"Looks like rain,\" he mutters, glancing up through the windshield. \"This\nmountain ain't real steep, but don't push your luck. If anythin' happens, you call\nus.\"\n\"Yessir.\"\n\"Also, here\u2014\" He holds out a big lunch box to me. \"Eat this up top.\"\nAutomatically, I accept it with both hands. It's heavy.\n\"Th-thank you very much...\"\n.. .For everything. Seriously. Why would you do so much for me? Oh yeah,\nand the ramen was super good. I can't make any of the words come out the way\nI want them to\u2014all I manage is a tiny \"Thanks. Really.\" The guy smiles\nslightly, takes out a cigarette, and lights up.\n\"I dunno what's goin' on with you,\" he says, exhaling smoke. \"But that\npicture ofltomori you made. That was good.\"\nThere's a lump in my throat. Distant thunder rumbles softly.\nI'm walking up a path to the shrine that's as vague as a deer track.\nSometimes I stop to check the destination I've marked on the map against\nthe GPS on my phone. It's all right\u2014I'm getting closer. The surrounding\nscenery looks sort of familiar, but I've climbed this mountain only once, in a\ndream. I'm not very sure about it. That means, for now, all I can do is follow\nthe map.\nAfter I got out of the car, I bowed low and stayed that way until my ride\nwas completely out of sight. As I did, I thought about Tsukasa and Okudera-\nsenpai, too. In the end, this guy and those two came all the way out here\nbecause they were worried about me. I must've looked really pathetic. I bet\nthey thought I was about to cry the whole time. I was probably so aggressively\ndistracted that, even if they wanted to ditch me, they couldn't.\nI can't keep acting like that forever. I can't keep taking advantage of the\nhelp people offer me, I think firmly, gazing at New Itomori Lake through the\ngaps in the trees.\nSuddenly, a big raindrop hits my face. The leaves around me start to rustle\nand shake. I pull up my hood and break into a run.\nThe rain keeps falling, pouring down with enough force to carve the dirt\naway.\nThe temperature's falling rapidly, absorbed by the rain. I can feel it on my\nskin.\nI eat my lunch in a little cave while waiting for the weather to let up. There\nare three big rice balls the size of my fist and lots of side dishes. The thick-\nsliced braised pork and bean sprouts stir-fried in sesame oil make it look like\nsuch a stereotypical ramen-shop lunch that it's funny. My body shakes with\ncold, but as I eat, I gradually warm up again. Chewing the grains of rice and\nswallowing, I can sense exactly where my throat and stomach are.\nThis is musubi, I think.\n\"Putting anything in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also\ncalled musubi. What you put in your body binds to your soul, you see. \"\nThat day, I decided I'd remember those words even after I woke up. I say it\naloud:\n\"...They twist and tangle, sometimes come undone, and reunite. That's\nmusubi. That's time.\"\nI look at the cord on my wrist.\nIt hasn't worn through yet. The connection is still there.\nBefore I know it, the trees have vanished, and I'm in a mossy, rocky area.\nBelow me, I can see fragments of the gourd-shaped lake through gaps in the\nthick clouds. I've finally reached the peak.\n\"...It's there!\"\nSure enough, beyond me, there's the crater-shaped basin and the giant\nsacred tree.\n\"It's really there! It wasn't a dream!\"\nThe rain has subsided to a drizzle, dripping down my cheeks like tears. I\nscrub roughly at my face with my sleeve, then start down the slope into the\ncaldera.",

Is it swollen from the rain, or has enough time passed since that\ndream that the landscape changed? Either way, the great tree stands several\ndozen yards away on the other side.\nThis is the edge of the next world.\nI remember somebody saying that to me once.\nDoes that make this the Sanzu River?\nI step into the water. There's a big, echoing splash, as if I've stuck my foot\ninto a bathtub, and I realize, belatedly, that this basin is unnaturally quiet. The\nheavy water is above my knees, and every step I take makes a loud sloshing\nsound. I start feeling as if I'm tromping all over something pure and white with\nmuddy feet, defiling it. Until I arrived, this place had been perfectly silent. I'm\nnot welcome , I think instinctively. My body heat is being sucked away again,\ninto the cold water. Before long, the water's up to my chest, but I manage to get\nacross somehow.\nThe massive tree stands with its roots twined around a big slab of rock.\nI don't know whether the \"body of the god\" is the tree, the rock, or whether\nthe shape of the two of them tangled together is what people worship. There's\na little stairway in the gap between the roots and the stone, and when I go\ndown it, I find a yawning space wide enough for about four tatami mats.\nThe silence here is even deeper than it was outside.\nI unzip my jacket with freezing hands and take out my phone. I check to\nmake sure it didn't get wet, then turn it on. In the darkness, every single\nmovement sounds violently loud. With an electronic vvum that seems\ncompletely out of place here, the phone comes alive, and I use it as a flashlight.\nThis place is wholly devoid of color or warmth.\nThe tiny shrine the light reveals is completely gray. On a small stone altar,\ntwo four-inch urns sit side by side.\n\"It's the sake we carried up here.\"\nGently, I touch the surface. I don't know when it happened, but I'm not cold\nanymore.\n\"This is her little sister's...\"\nMy hand closes around the urn on the left, confirming its shape. When I pick\nit up, there's a slight resistance and a faint, dry tearing noise. The moss had put\ndown roots.\n\"And this is the one I brought.\"\nI sit down where I am, bring the urn close to my face, and shine the light on\nit. The porcelain was shiny before, but now it's thickly covered with moss. It\nmust have been a very long time. I put a thought that's been inside me all this\ntime into words.\n. .Then I was swapping with the Mitsuha from three years ago?\"\nI untie the braided cord sealing the lid. Underneath, there's a cork stopper.\n\"Were we three years out of sync? Did the swapping stop because she died\nthree years ago when the meteorite fell?\"\nI pull out the cork. The faint scent of alcohol rises. I pour the sake into the\nlid.\n\"Half of her...\"\nI bring the light closer to it. The sake is clear, with several tiny particles\nfloating in it. They reflect the light, glittering in the liquid.\n\" Musubi . Twisting and tangling, sometimes coming undone, then\nreuniting...\"\nI raise the lidful of sake to my lips.\n\"If time really can 'come undone,' then... Just one more time...\"\nTake me to her! I wish and down it in one gulp. When I swallow, the sound\nis so conspicuous it startles me. A lump of heat travels through my body. As it\nhits the bottom of my stomach, it bursts, scattering through me.\nBut nothing happens.\nFor a little while, I sit very still.\nI'm not used to alcohol, and I feel a little warm. My head feels slightly\nvague and dizzy... But that's all.\nIt's no good. It didn't work.\nI put one knee up, then stand. Abruptly, my feet tangle. My vision spins. I'm\nfalling , I think.\n...That's weird.\nI've fallen over backward, but no matter how much time passes, my back\ndoesn't hit the ground. My field of view rotates, slowly, up to the roof of the\ncave. My phone is still in my left hand. The light illuminates the ceiling.\n\"The comet...!\"\nInvoluntarily, I say it out loud.\nThere's a drawing of an enormous comet up there.\nIt's a very old picture, carved into the rock: a giant traveling star, trailing\nits long tail across the heavens. The red and blue pigments catch the light and\nshimmer. Gradually, the picture begins rising away from the ceiling of the\ncave.\nI stare.\nThe image, the illustrated comet, is falling toward me.\nSlowly, it bears down until it's nearly on top of me. It blazes with the heat\nof its friction against the atmosphere, and the lump of rock fuses into glass,\nshining like a jewel. Even those details are clear to me.\nI fall back, and my head hits the rock at the exact moment the comet strikes\nmy body.",

      "text": "The NHK lady is yapping cheerfully. I've just changed into my school\nuniform and come downstairs. It's been a while since my skirt-clad lower\nbody felt this vulnerable, and in order to shake the sensation, I'm standing tall\nand tough, glaring at the TV\n\"Comet Tiamat has now been visible to the naked eye for about a week. It\nwill be closest to Earth at approximately seven forty this evening, which is\nwhen it's expected to be brightest as well. The astronomy spectacular that only\ncomes once every twelve centuries has reached its climax, and various\nfestivities will be held all around the...\"\n\"Tonight! There's still time!\" I mutter. I'm trembling with nerves and\nexcitement.\n\"Good mornin', Mitsuha. Yotsuha went on ahead today.\"\nI turn around, and the old lady's standing there.\n\"Grandma! You're looking good!\" Without thinking, I run over to her. She\nhas a teapot on a tray, probably planning to enjoy some tea in the living room.\n\"Huh? ...My. You're...\"\nShe pulls down her reading glasses and takes a good look at my face. Her\neyes narrow softly.\n\"You aren't Mitsuha, are you?\"\n\"Wha...?\" How?! I feel guilty, as if some crime I knew would never come\nto light has been exposed. Hang on, though. This might make things easier.\n\"Grandma... You knew?\"\nThere's no particular change in the old lady's expression. As she speaks,\nshe lowers herself into a legless chair.\n\"No. But watchin' you lately reminded me. When I was a girl, I had some\nstrange dreams myself.\"\nHear that?! That's awesome\u2014this oughta be a quick conversation, then.\nJust what I'd expect from a Japanese folktale family. I join her at the table, and\nthe old lady fills a cup for me, too. Sipping her tea, she continues her story.\n\"They were very odd dreams. More than dreams, really. They were another\nlife. I became a boy I didn't know in a town I'd never seen before.\"\nI swallow hard. Exactly like us...\n\"But one day, they ended, just like that. All I remember now is that I had\nstrange dreams. My memories of who I became in them disappeared\ncompletely.\"\n\"Disappeared...\"\nMy heart skips a beat, as if I've been told the name of a disease I'm fated to\nget. She's right. For a little while, I forgot Mitsuha's name. I tried to convince\nmyself that it was all a delusion. The old lady's wrinkled face takes on a tinge\nof loneliness.\n\"So treasure who you are now and the things you're seein'. No matter how\nspecial it is, a dream's a dream. It'll disappear for sure someday, once you\nwake. We all had a time like that, you know: my mother, myself, and your\nmother.\"\n\"That's... What if...?!\"\nAbruptly, it hits me. This might be a role passed down through the\nMiyamizu family: the ability to communicate with someone living a few years\nin the future to escape the disaster that strikes every twelve hundred years. A\nshrine maiden's role. Something the Miyamizu bloodline acquired at some\npoint.. .a warning system inherited across generations.\n\"Maybe the Miyamizus' dreams were all for today!\"\nI look the old lady straight in the eye, speaking firmly. \"Grandma, listen.\"\nShe raises her head. From her expression, I can't tell how she'll take what\nI'm about to say.\n\"Tonight, a meteorite will strike the town of Itomori, and everyone will\ndie.\"\nThis time, the old lady's eyebrows knit in unmistakable doubt.\n\"Nobody'd believe hooey like that.\" That old broad says some\nsurprisingly normal stuff.\nI run down the hill to the high school, silently brooding to myself.\nShe believes the swapping dreams but not the meteorite strike. What sort of\nsense of balance does she have, anyway?\nI'm really late, and there's almost nobody around. The calls of the copper\npheasants echo, piichik paachik, and it's just another peaceful morning in\ntown. We 'll have to do it ourselves, I think.\n\"There's no way I'm letting anybody die!\"\nI shout it out loud, emphatically, as if hammering the resolution into my own\nmind. I run even faster. There's not even half a day left until that meteor comes\ndown.\n\"Mitsuha, wha...? Y-your hair...!\"\n\"Girl, that hair! What on earth?!\"\nThe second I enter the classroom, Teshigawara and Saya stare at my\n(Mitsuha's) face, dumbfounded.\n\"Oh yeah, the hair? It was way better before, right?\"\nAs I speak, I flip the shoulder-length bob away from the back of my neck.\nCome to think of it, Mitsuha lopped off most of that long hair of hers at some\npoint, didn't she? I prefer long black hair, so I'm not a fan of this... No, that's\nnot what's important now!\n\"Never mind that!\"\nTeshigawara's mouth is hanging open so wide, I can practically hear the\nsound effect for shock. Saya's examining me searchingly. I look back and forth\nbetween them.\n\"If nothing changes, everyone's gonna die tonight!\"\nThe hum in the classroom stops dead. All our classmates' eyes are on me.\n\"H-hold it, Mitsuha. What're you sayin'?!\"\nSaya hastily stands up, and Teshigawara grabs my arm and pulls me. As\nthey drag me out of the classroom, my head finally cools down a bit. I guess\nit's only natural that they wouldn't believe me. Maybe it's like the old lady\nsaid, and it's unreasonable to expect people to buy something like this out of\nthe blue. I was so excited about swapping for the first time in ages that I\nconvinced myself things would just work out somehow.\nHmm. This might be tougher than I expected.",

Tonight, Comet Tiamat is going to split and turn into a\nmeteorite, and it's hugely likely it's gonna hit this town. I can't reveal my\nsources, but I got the information through a reliable channel.\"\n\"That's.. .a full-on emergency!\"\n\"C'mon, Tesshi, what're you lookin' so serious for? Are you really that\ndumb?\"\nNaturally, Saya isn't having any of it.\n\"What's this source of yours, anyway? The CIA? NASA? What're you goin'\non about? 'Reliable channels'? You pretendin' you're a spy now? Honestly,\nMitsuha, what's the matter with you?!\"\nShe couldn't be more sensible. Getting desperate, I dump all the money out\nof Mitsuha's wallet.\n\"Saya, please! I'll pay, so take this and go buy whatever you want! Then at\nleast listen to what I've got to say!\"\nI'm begging, and my expression is dead serious. Startled, Saya takes a long,\nhard look at me.\n\"But you're always tight with your money... You're really goin' that far?\"\nHuh? She is? But she burned through my money like crazy!\nSaya sighs, as if she's resigned herself. \"...I guess I'll have to, then. None\nof this makes any sense, but fine, I'll at least listen. Tesshi, gimme the key to\nyour bike.\" She sets off for the main entrance, grumbling, \"This ain't enough\nfor more than a couple cheap sweets.\"\nGood. It looks like the amount wasn't enough, but she believes I'm serious\nnow.\n\"I'm goin' to the convenience store. Tesshi, you keep a close eye on\nMitsuha. She ain't quite right.\"\nAnd so Teshigawara and I sneak into a room in the club building nobody\nuses anymore and put together an evacuation plan for the town.\nThe goal is to get all 188 families\u2014about five hundred people\u2014out of the\ndanger zone before the meteorite falls. The first thing we think of is\nbroadcasting an evacuation order.\nAfter we run through the inevitable ridiculous ideas\u2014 We'll take over the\nprime minister's official residence! Or the Diet Building! Or the NHK\nShibuya Broadcasting Center, or at least the NHK Gifu-Takayama branch\noffice! \u2014we start talking about how not everybody in town will be at home\nwith their TVs or radios on and how even more people will be out and about\nbecause of the autumn festival tonight. Then we fall silent, thinking.\n\".. .The disaster alert system!\" Teshigawara shouts suddenly.\n\"Disaster alert system?\"\n\"Hunh? Don't go tellin' me you don't know. There are speakers all over\ntown, remember?\"\n\"Oh... That thing that starts talking out of the blue every morning and\nevening? Who was born, who's having a funeral, that sort of thing?\"\n\"Yeah. You can hear that all over town for sure, whether you're inside or\nout. If we send the order over that...!\"\n\"Huh? But, uh...how? That comes from the town hall, doesn't it? Would\nthey let us broadcast stuff if we asked?\"\n\"Pssh. No.\"\n\"Then what do we do? Hijack Town Hall? I mean, I guess we'd have a\nbetter shot at that than at taking over NHK, but...\"\n\"Heh-heh-heh.\" With a creepy smile, Teshigawara types something into his\nphone. Geez, this guy looks happy.\n\"We can do this!\"\nHe holds out his phone to me.\nSuperimposed frequencies, it reads, and below is an explanation.\n\"Wha...? Is this for real?\"\nTeshigawara flares his nostrils and nods proudly.\n\"Uh, Tesshi... Why do you even know stuff like this?\"\n\"Well, I always fantasize before I fall asleep, y'know? About destroyin' the\ntown, overthrowin' the school, stuff like that. Doesn't everybody?\"\n\"Huh...?\" That weirds me out a bit. But, no\u2014this is...\n\"This is awesome, Tesshi! It just might work!\"\nWithout thinking, I throw an arm around Teshigawara's shoulders.\n\"H-hey, don't get too close!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWhoa. Even his ears are red.\n\"What's this? Tesshi, are you embarrassed?\"\nI look up into Teshigawara's face from below, grinning at him. Well, well,\nMitsuha, you're not to be taken lightly, are you? C'mon, c'mon! I press my\nbody against him some more. Here you go\u2014have a freebie! We're sitting side\nby side on an old sofa, and Tesshi's already right by the wall, so he's got\nnowhere to run.\n\"Hey, Mitsuha, cut it out!\"\nTeshigawara resists, big body squirming. He's a guy, for sure... Well, so\nam I. Then, abruptly, Teshigawara jumps up, climbing onto the back of the sofa,\nand yells, \"I told you, knock it off! A single girl your age\u2014that ain't proper!\"\n\"Ha...\"\nEven his buzzed scalp is red. He's sweating bullets, and his eyes look\nalmost teary.\n\"Ha, ha-ha-ha! Tesshi, you're such a...!\"\nIn spite of myself, I crack up laughing.\nHe's a really good guy, and I'm positive I can count on him.\nI thought of him as a friend before, but I'd like to meet him and the others\nfor real and talk to them as a guy soon. Me and Mitsuha and Teshigawara and\nSaya. If Tsukasa and Takagi and Okudera-senpai were there, too, I know it'd\nbe a blast.\n\"Sorry, Tesshi. I was just so happy you believed me...\" I'm biting back\nlaughter, and Teshigawara's sulking. \"Will you help me think up the rest of the\nevacuation plan?\"\nI smile at him Tesshi's face is still red, but even so, he nods seriously.\nOnce this is over, I'll come see this guy, too, I think, feeling a little bit\ndazzled.\n\"A-a-a...a bomb?!\"\nSaya yells. She's eating a mini shortcake from a clear plastic wrapper.\n\"Technically, they're called water-gel explosives. They're kinda like\ndynamite,\" Teshigawara tells her, sounding proud. He's crunching away on\npotato chips, and I'm noshing on chocolate drops. Saya bought a ton of\nconvenience-store food and spread it all over the desk, so it sort of feels like\nwe're having a party.\nTeshigawara and I are standing behind a map, outlining our carefully\nengineered evacuation plan to Saya. I almost want to play some energetic\nmusic to set the stage. Something percussive and a bit unhinged\u2014something\nthat sounds like a strategy meeting.\nTaking a gulp of coffee milk from a pint-size pack, Teshigawara continues.\n\"There's lots of explosives in my dad's company's warehouse, for construction\nstuff. If I don't have to worry about gettin' caught afterward, I can snatch as\nmuch as we need.\"\n\"Then, next,\" I say, opening a melon bread wrapper. I'm really hungry, and\nfor some reason, everything I eat when I'm in Mitsuha's body tastes really\ngood.\n\"Y-y-y.. .you're gonna hijack the signal?!\" Saya's voice cracks.\nMunching on curry bread, Teshigawara explains. \"Rural wireless disaster\nalert systems like ours are easy to take over, as long as you know the\ntransmission frequency and the superimposed wake-up frequency. The\nspeakers are made so they'll activate as long as a specific frequency is layered\nover the audio.\"\nMelon bread in one hand, I pick up where he left off. \"That means we can\nsend the evacuation order all over town from the school broadcasting room.\"\nI point at the map of Itomori. There's a circle with a diameter of a little less\nthan a mile, centered on Miyamizu Shrine, and I trace its edge with my finger.\n\"This is the area that's supposed to take damage from the meteorite. As you\ncan see, Itomori High is outside it.\" I tap on the location of the high school.\n\"In other words, we just need to evacuate people here, to the schoolyard.\"\n\"B-but that's...\" Saya begins stammering nervously. \"That's a full-blown\ncrime!\"\nEven as she says it, she's putting the strawberry\u2014which she saved for last\n\u2014in her mouth.\n\"We'll never get the people around here to move without committing a\ncrime,\" I tell her coolly, sweeping away the chocolate drops I'd scattered over\nthe map. That's right. As long as it gets the people inside this circle to leave, it\ndoesn't matter whether it's a crime or not.\n\"Y'know, Mitsuha, it's like you're a different person.\"\nI grin and take a big bite of melon bread. When I'm in this body, I\nunconsciously start talking a bit like a girl, but I've completely abandoned\ntrying to act like Mitsuha. As long as these guys are still safe when\neverything's over, nothing else matters. As long as we're all alive, things will\nwork out.",

You're the one in charge of the broadcast, Saya,\" I tell her\ncheerfully.\n\"Why?!\"\n\"Well, you're in the broadcasting club, right?\"\n\"Plus, your big sis is in charge of the Town Hall broadcast. Get her to tell\nyou the wireless frequency,\" says Teshigawara.\n\"Huh? I can't just...\"\nIgnoring Saya's protest, Teshigawara happily points to himself. \"I'm the\nexplosives guy!\"\n\"And I'm going to go talk to the mayor,\" I say, pointing to myself.\n\"Huh?!\" Saya is speechless, and Teshigawara picks up the explanation.\n\"We can probably set up the evacuation on our own with the plan we just\ntalked about. But if the town hall and firefighters don't come out at the end,\nthere's no way we'll get everybody in all one hundred eighty-eight families to\nmove, y'know?\"\n\"That's why we need to persuade the mayor,\" I tell her. \"I'm his daughter. If\nI can explain it to him rationally, I'm sure he'll understand.\"\nTeshigawara folds his arms and nods, patting himself on the back. \"It's a\nperfect strategy!\" That's exactly how I feel. True, our methods are a bit rough,\nbut I don't think there's any other way to do it.\n\"Haaaaaah...\" Saya watches us with her mouth agape, though I can't tell\nwhether she's amazed or appalled. \"Well, I'm impressed you thought it through\nthat far, but... This is all just in case something happens, isn't it?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nI hadn't expected that question this late in the game, and I'm at a loss for\nwords.\n\"Uh.. .not exactly...\"\nIf Saya doesn't get on board, this plan won't work. I don't know what to\ntell her, and I search for something to say.\n\"That ain't necessarily so!\" Abruptly, Teshigawara jumps in, thrusting out\nthe screen on his phone. \"Do you know how Itomori Lake got made?\"\nSaya and I squint at the screen. It's a site that looks like the town's home\npage, with a header that says The Origins of Itomori Lake. Then the words A\nmeteoric lake from twelve hundred years ago, and Incredibly rare for Japan.\n\"It's a meteoric lake! This place already had at least one meteorite strike!\"\nAs Teshigawara says this, a triumphant look on his face, something clicks in\nmy mind. I start speaking before I even know what it is. \"That's right\u2014he's\nright... That's why!\"\nThat's why there was a picture of the comet in a place like that, I realize.\nComet Tiamat has a twelve-hundred-year cycle. Itomori Lake is a twelve-\nhundred-year-old meteoric lake. The meteorite strikes every twelve hundred\nyears, when the comet passes. A presaged disaster. That means it should be\navoidable. That picture was both a message and a warning.\nI feel as if I've picked up an unexpected ally. I can't hold still any longer.\nThe preparations for this were laid a thousand years ago!\n\"Good one, Tesshi!\"\nWithout thinking, I stick out my fist, and Teshigawara bumps it. \"Yeah!\"\nThis will work. It's gonna work!\n\"Let's do this!\"\nWe turn to Saya, speaking in unison, spit flying with enthusiasm.\n\".. .What are you talking about?\"\nThe voice is rough and heavy, like the sound of scissors cutting into thick\ncardboard.\nI get increasingly flustered. I talk louder, so as not to get steamrolled. \"I\ntold you! You have to evacuate the townspeople, just in case, or\u2014\"\n\"Be quiet a minute.\"\nHis voice isn't raised at all, but it shuts me up.\nMitsuha's dad, Mayor Miyamizu, closes his eyes wearily and leans back in\nthe upholstered chair in his office. The thick leather creaks audibly. Then he\nexhales, slowly, and gazes out the window. The shadows of the leaves sway in\nthe bright afternoon sunlight.\n\".. .The comet is going to split in two and fall on this town? More than five\nhundred people could die?\"\nHe taps the desk with his fingertips, leaving a long pause. Then finally, he\nreturns his gaze to me. The backs of my knees are sweating. For the first time, I\nrealize that's where Mitsuha gets sweaty when she's nervous.\n\"I know it's hard to believe, but I do have grounds for\u2014\"\n\"How dare you come to me with nonsense like that!\"\nOut of nowhere, he explodes. The creases between his eyes grow deeper.\n\"Do delusions run in the Miyamizu bloodline?\" he grumbles quietly, as if\ntalking to himself. He fixes me with a piercing look and speaks in a low tone.\n\"Listen, Mitsuha. If you're being serious with me, then you are ill.\"\n\"...Wha\u2014?\"\nThe words won't come. I realize the confidence I'd had in the clubroom\njust thirty minutes ago is gone without a trace. The uneasy feeling that I'm\nactually misguided is building rapidly. No, that's not true. I'm not deluded, and\nI'm not sick. I'm\u2014\n\"I'll send a car around for you.\" The mayor picks up the phone, suddenly\nsounding concerned. He starts dialing, initiating a call even as he's speaking to\nme. \"Have a doctor at the city hospital look at you. After that, I'll hear what\nyou have to say.\"\nThe words send an unpleasant jolt through me. This guy is seriously treating\nme, his own daughter, like a head case. The second it registers, my whole body\ngoes as cold as ice, while the core of my brain flares so hot it might as well be\non fire.\nIt's rage.\n\"\u2014Don't you talk down to me, you bastard!\"\nThe words come out as a scream. The mayor's wide eyes are right in front\nof me. Without thinking, I've grabbed him by his necktie and hauled him up.\nThe phone receiver falls to the floor beside the desk, and I hear the tiny buzz of\na dead line.\n\"...Ah\u2014\"\nI relax my grip. Slowly, the man's face recedes. Mayor Miyamizu's lips are\nslack and trembling slightly, in either shock or bewilderment. We're staring\neach other in the eye. Neither of us is able to look away. A cold sweat opens\nevery pore on my body.\n\"Mitsuha.\"\nThe mayor sounds as if he's struggling to squeeze the air out.\n\"No... Who are you?\"\nHe's trembling.

The town is too quiet, and even sounds\nfrom very far off reach my ears on the breeze. Tok-tok, tok-tok.\nAfter leaving the mayor's office, I trudge along the hill road overlooking\nthe lake, picturing a nail being driven into hard lumber in time with the noise.\nAn iron nail, wedged into dark, cramped splinters, destined to rust. They 're\nprobably getting ready for the autumn festival up at the shrine , I think\nabsently, gazing at the wooden lanterns that line the road.\nHearing children's voices above me\u2014\"'Kay, see you later!\"\u2014I lookup.\nFarther up the slope, kids with backpacks are waving to one another.\n\"Mm-hmm, I'll see you at the festival.\"\n\"Meet us below the shrine.\"\nWith that, a boy and girl part ways with their friend and come running\ntoward me. They're in the middle years of elementary school, probably about\nYotsuha's age.\nIt fell on the shrine.\n\"Don't go!\" The boy's just about to run past me, and without thinking, I grab\nhis shoulders. \"Get out of town! Tell your friends, too!\"\nBetween my arms, the expression of a kid I don't even know slides into\nterror.\n\"Wh-what's wrong with you?!\"\nHe shoves my hands away. I come back to my senses.\n\"Sis!\"\nWhen I turn toward the voice, Yotsuha's running down the hill toward me,\nwearing her backpack and a worried expression. The two kids make a break\nfor it and dash away. I can't do stuff like this. I'll just seem creepy.\n\"Sis?! What'd you do to those kids?!\" Yotsuha pounces on me, grabbing my\narms and looking up into my face.\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nI look at Yotsuha. She's anxiously waiting for me to say something. \"If\nMitsuha had tried...\" I murmur the thoughts as they come. \"Could she have\ntalked him into it? Is it just me who can't do it?\" Yotsuha's bewildered, but I\nignore her and keep going. \"Yotsuha, before evening comes, take Grandma and\nget out of town.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"If you stay here, you'll die!\"\n\"What?! Sis, c'mon\u2014what're you talkin' about?!\"\n\"This is important,\" I tell her, but Yotsuha desperately raises her voice,\ntrying to push my words back at me.\n\"Sis, snap out of it!\"\nHer eyes are tearing up. She's scared. As Yotsuha speaks, she stands on her\ntiptoes, gazing into my eyes. \"You took off for Tokyo all of a sudden yesterday,\ntoo. You've been weird all the time lately, Sis!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nI feel a strange sense of wrongness... Tokyo?\n\"Yotsuha, did you just say Tokyo?\"\n\"Heeey, Mitsuhaaa!\"\nIt's Saya. When I look up, she's waving wildly from the back of the bike\nTeshigawara's pedaling. It brakes, skidding a bit on the asphalt.\n\"Did you talk to your dad?! How'd it go?!\"\nTeshigawara's leaning forward. I can't respond. I'm confused. I don't know\nwhat to think anymore. The mayor wouldn't listen to a word I said. Not only\nthat, the guy asked his own daughter who she was. / made him do that. Is it\nbecause I'm in Mitsuha? Is that why it didn't work? In that case, where is she\nnow? Yotsuha says Mitsuha went to Tokyo yesterday. Why? When was\n\"yesterday\"?\n\"Hey, Mitsuha?\" I hear Teshigawara's puzzled voice.\n\"What's wrong with your sis?\" Sayaka asks Yotsuha.\nWhere is Mitsuha? Where am I, right now?\nWhat if... ?\nI lift my eyes. Beyond the houses, the rolling outlines of mountains build on\neach other, and beyond them, there's a misty blue ridgeline. The mountain I\nclimbed. The body of the god at the peak. The place where I drank the sake. A\nlight, cold wind blows up from the lake, stirring Mitsuha's newly short hair.\nThe strands stroke my cheeks softly, almost like someone's fingertips.\n\"Is she.. .there?\" I mutter.\n\"Huh? What? What's the matter? Is somethin' up there?\"\nYotsuha and Saya and Teshigawara all follow my gaze. Mitsuha, if you're\nthere\u2014\n\"Tesshi, let me borrow your bike!\"\nEven as I speak, I grab the handlebars, wrenching it away from him. I\nstraddle the seat, then kick off.\n\"Hey, wha\u2014? Mitsuha!\"\nThe seat's really high. Standing up to pedal, I start climbing the hill road.\n\"Mitsuha, what about the operation?!\"\nAs I get farther away, Teshigawara yells after me. He sounds like he might\nbe about to cry.\n\"Get ready, just like we planned! Please!\"\nMy shout echoes through the hushed town. Severed from her body,\nMitsuha's voice rebounds between the mountains and the lake, filling the air\nfor a moment. As if chasing that voice, I stomp on the pedals with all my might.\n\u25a0# + +",

Chilly, as\nif a moment earlier it had been touching ice. Who in the world would wake me\nup like that?\nI open my eyes.\nHuh?\nIt's really dark. Maybe it's still night.\nAnother tap on my cheek. No... This is water. Drops of water have been\nhitting my face. When I sit up, I finally notice.\n\".. .I'm Taki!\" Without meaning to, I say it out loud.\nAs I climb the narrow stone steps, the evening sun lances straight into my\neyes.\nI must have been in the dark for quite a while. Taki's eyes sting and tear up.\nWhen I've climbed all the way to the top, my guess is confirmed: I'm on the\nmountain of the body of the god.\nWhat is Taki doing here?\nWithout really understanding what's going on, I emerge from beneath the\ngiant tree and begin walking across the basin. Taki is wearing a heavy camping\nparka and hiking shoes with thick rubber soles. The ground is soft and wet, and\nit might have just stopped raining\u2014the low grass is thick with water droplets.\nWhen I look up, though, the sky is perfectly clear. Thin, shredded clouds\nstream in the wind, glowing and golden.\nMy memories are oddly vague.\nStill unable to remember anything, before long I come to the edge of the\nbasin, the foot of the slope. I lookup the hill. This whole area is a depression.\nThe top of this slope is the top of the mountain. I start climbing. As I do, I\nsearch my memories, trying to remember what I was doing before I came here.\nThen my fingers touch the edge.\nFestival music. A light summer kimono. My own face, hair cut short,\nreflected in a mirror.\nThat's right.\nYesterday was the autumn festival. Tesshi and Saya asked me to go, so I put\non my traditional clothes and went out. It was the day the comet was supposed\nto be brightest, so we were going to watch. Yes, that was it. It all seems very\ndistant somehow, but it was definitely yesterday.\nMy new haircut really startled Tesshi and Saya. Tesshi's mouth gaped so\nwide, you could practically hear the sound effect for shock. They were so\nshaken I felt a little sorry for them. The entire walk to the hill, they whispered\nbehind my back.\n\"Hey, do you think she got her heart broken? \"\n\"Why do you go there?! Are you some old guy from last century? \"\nWhen we'd climbed all the way up the narrow one-lane road and turned at\nthe traffic mirror, there it was: an enormous comet in the night sky, straight\nabove us. Its long, streaming tail shone emerald green, and its head was\nbrighter than the moon. If I strained my eyes, I could see particles glittering\naround it like fine dust. We forgot to talk to each other and just stood there with\nour mouths open like idiots, staring, fascinated, for a long time.\nThen, at some point, I realized the comet had split. There were two big,\nbright tips, and one seemed to be steadily coming closer. Before long, several\ndelicate shooting stars began shining around it. It was like the heavens were\nfalling. No\u2014that night, the stars actually did fall. It was a sight straight out of a\ndream, an impossibly beautiful night sky.\nI finally reach the top of the slope. The wind buffeting me is cold. Below\nme, a blanket of clouds unfolds like a shining carpet. Through them, I can see\nItomori Lake, which is beginning to be tinted with faint blue shadows.\nHuh? I think.\nHow strange.\nFor the past little while, I've been shaking so hard it's as if someone's put\nme on ice.\nOut of nowhere, I'm so scared I can't handle it.\nI'm terrified, anxious, sad, and lonely, and it feels like I might lose my\nmind. I'm gushing cold sweat as though a tap has broken.\nWhat if...?\nMaybe I have gone crazy. Maybe I cracked before I even knew it was\nhappening.\nI'm scared. I'm scared. I want to scream right this minute, but sticky breath\nis the only thing that comes out of my throat. My eyelids open wider and wider,\ndriven by a will that isn't mine. The surfaces of my eyes are desert dry.\nThey're gazing at the lake. I know. I've seen it.\nItomori is gone.\nA bigger round lake has formed, overlapping Itomori Lake.\nSomewhere inside my mind, I think, Well, of course it has.\nAfter a thing like that fell on us.\nAfter that leaden, sweltering mass came down on our heads.\nThat's right.\nThat night, I...\nIt's as if my joints have broken without a sound. I drop to my knees on the\nspot.\nThat night... I...\nThe air that leaks from my throat becomes a voice, just barely.\n\"That night...\"\nTaki's memories flood into me. The comet disaster that destroyed an entire\ntown. The fact that Taki really lived in Tokyo three years in the future. The fact\nthat, by then, I wasn't anywhere anymore. The night the star fell. Back then, I...\n\"...I died...?\"\nL + +\nWhere do human memories live?\nAre they in the synaptic circuitry of the brain? Do retinas and fingertips\nhold memories, too? Or is there an invisible, amorphous, mistlike, spiritual\ncollective somewhere, and that's where the memories reside? Something we'd\ncall the heart or the mind or the soul. Is it something you can take out and stick\nback in, like a memory card with an OS on it?\nThe asphalt cut out a while back, and I've been pedaling over unpaved\nmountain roads. The low sun flickers through the gaps among the trees.\nMitsuha's body is sweating nonstop, and my bangs are plastered to my\nforehead. As I pedal, I wipe the hair out of my face along with the sweat.\nMitsuha's soul must be in my body right now. After all, my heart's here, in\nhers. But... This is something I've been thinking for a while.\nEven now, we're together.\nMitsuha, or at least some fragment of her heart, is still here. For example,\nher fingers remember the shape of her uniform. When I put it on, I naturally\nknow the length of the zipper and the stiffness of the collar. When Mitsuha's\neyes see her friends, I feel relieved and happy. Without even asking, I can tell\nwho Mitsuha likes and who she's not comfortable around. When I see her\ngrandma, memories I shouldn't even have rise hazily in my mind, like a\nprojector with broken focus. Body and memories and emotions are bound\ntogether inseparably.\nTaki.\nI've been hearing Mitsuha's voice inside this body for a while now.\nTaki, Taki.\nHer tone is earnest, pleading, as if she's about to cry. A voice trembling\nwith loneliness, like the glimmer of distant stars.\nThe blurry image sharpens. Taki , Mitsuha's calling.\n\"Don't you remember me? \"\nAnd then I recall her memories of that day.\n+ + +",

      "text": "That day, instead of going to school, Mitsuha got on a train.\nShe went to a big terminal station, where the Shinkansen to Tokyo stopped.\nThe local train she took to get there was empty, despite the fact that it was rush\nhour, when students were heading to school. Since there were no schools along\nthe track, everyone who commuted around here drove.\n'Tmgoin' into Tokyo for a bit.\"\nThis had been Mitsuha's abrupt announcement to her little sister when they\nleft the house that morning.\n\"Huh? Now? Why?!\" Yotsuha asks, startled.\n\"Um... For a date?\"\n\"Wha\u2014?! Sis, you have a boyfriend in Tokyo?!\"\n\"Uh, well... It's not my date.\" Unsure how to explain herself, Mitsuha\nbreaks into a run. \"I'll be back tonight. Don't worry!\"\nGazing at the scenery flying past the window of the bullet train, Mitsuha\nwonders:\nWhy am I crashin ' Okudera-senpai and Takis date? It's not like the three\nof us can just hang out together. Besides, I've never been to Tokyo before.\nWill I even be able to find Taki? Even if I do, will it bother him that I'm\nshowin' up out of the blue? Will he be surprised? Maybe he 'll be upset...\nWith an uncomplicated ease almost inviting disappointment, the Shinkansen\nslides into Tokyo. The incredible crowds leave Mitsuha breathless, but she\ntries calling my cell. \"...Because the unit is out of range or turned off, the\nnumber you are trying to reach is... \" She hangs up. Just like the other calls, it\ndidn't go through.\nI'll never find him, Mitsuha thinks.\nStill, after staring at the station information board like it's a quiz, she heads\ninto the city, relying on her vague memories.\nBut if I do see him...\nShe rides the Yamanote Line, the city bus, walks, takes another train, then\nwalks some more.\nWhat 'll I do? It probably will bother him, right? Maybe it 'll be awkward.\nOr maybe \u2014\nShe sees the words Comet Tiamat at Closest Point Tomorrow on a big\noutdoor TV screen.\nOr, if I do find him, just maybe, will he\u2014?\nTired from walking, she gazes at the sparkling lights of the buildings from a\npedestrian bridge and thinks, almost praying:\nIf I find Taki, maybe he 'll be just a little bit happy...\nShe starts walking again, still thinking.\nI'll never find him searchin ' randomly like this. I won't, but I know one\nthing for sure. If we meet, we 'll know right away. \"You 're the one who was in\nme. I'm the one who was in you. \"\nMitsuha's certain of this, as if it's as simple as two plus two.\nThe evening sun sinks through the gap between the station platform roofs, as\nweak as a dying flashlight.\nMitsuha's feet are sore from all the walking she's done, and she plants\nherself on a bench with her legs kicked out in front of her. She stares absently\nat the setting sun, which is much paler and less reliable than in Itomori.\nA musical chime plays, and a voice announces: \"The local train to...\nChiba...is arriving on... Track Four. \" A yellow train glides onto the platform.\nThe cars kick up a warm wind that ruffles her hair. Mitsuha gazes at the train\nwindows without really seeing them.\nAbruptly, her breath catches.\nShe jumps to her feet as if she's been stung.\nHe 'd been there, in the window that had just passed in front of her.\nMitsuha breaks into a sprint. The cars have stopped, and she catches up to\nthe window almost immediately. The evening train is crowded, though, and she\ncan't find him again from outside. With a sound like a giant exhalation, the\ndoors open. The car's so tightly packed that the people are practically spilling\nout, making Mitsuha shiver. Even so\u2014murmuring \"Excuse me\" and sweating\nbehind the knees\u2014she pushes her way into the crowd. With another giant sigh,\nthe doors close. The train begins moving. Repeating \"Excuse me\" over and\nover, little by little, Mitsuha works her way forward. Then, in front of one boy,\nshe stops. The sounds around her vanish.\nIt's me. The middle school \"me\" from three years ago.\n+ + +",

      "text": "I can't go any higher on the bike.\nNo sooner have I had the thought than the front wheel catches on a root, and\nI slip.\nOn reflex, I grab the trunk of a nearby tree. The bike slips out from under\nme and tumbles down the slope, hitting the ground about ten feet below with a\nhuge racket. The wheels are bent all out of shape. \"Sorry, Teshigawara,\" I\nmutter softly, and I take off running up the narrow mountain track.\nWhy did I forget? Why didn't I remember until just now?\nAs I run, I stare at the memories welling up inside me.\nMitsuha, that day, three years ago, you came to see me\u2014\n+ +\nTaki. Taki, Taki.\nFor a while now, Mitsuha has been silently rolling my name around on her\ntongue. I haven't noticed her at all, even though I'm right in front of her. She\nkeeps fretting over what tone she should use to address me and what\nexpression she should wear, so earnestly she seems liable to burst into tears.\nThen, forcing a bright smile, she says:\n\"Taki.\"\nThe middle school me is startled hearing my name out of the blue, and I\nglance up. We're still about the same height, so her big, vaguely teary eyes are\nright in front of me.\n\"Huh...?\"\n\"Um, do you...\"\nSmiling desperately, Mitsuha points to herself. I'm bewildered.\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"Don't you remember me?\" asks this stranger, timidly, looking at me\nthrough her lashes.\n\"Who're you?\"\nMitsuha gives a small, breathy shriek, then quickly turns red. She lowers\nher eyes, speaking in a voice that's barely audible.\n\"Oh... I'm sorry...\"\nThe train sways. The passengers all adjust to keep their balance, except for\nMitsuha, who staggers into me. Her hair brushes the tip of my nose, and I catch\nthe faint scent of shampoo. \"I'm sorry,\" she mumbles again.\nWeird girl , thinks middle school me.\nMitsuha's muddled mind races desperately. But you're Taki, so why...? For\nboth of us, time passes awkwardly.\n\"The next station is ...Yotsuya. \" The announcement offers Mitsuha a bit of\nrelief. At the same time, though, she feels unbearably sad. Still, she can't stay\nhere any longer. The doors open, and she moves with the rest of the crowd to\nexit the train.\nWatching her receding back, I suddenly think, Maybe this weird girl is\nsomebody I should know. This inexplicable, intense impulse drives me to call\nout.\n\"'Scuse me! What's your name?\"\nMitsuha turns back, but the waves of disembarking passengers push her\nfarther away. Hurriedly, she undoes the braided cord tying back her hair. She\nholds it out to me and shouts:\n\"Mitsuha!\"\nWithout thinking, I reach for it. It's a vivid orange, like a thin ray of evening\nsun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that color tight.\n\"My name is Mitsuha!\"\n^ +\nThat day, three years ago, you came to see me.\nFinally, I know.\nA girl I didn't recognize spoke to me on the train once. To me, that was all\nit'd been, and I completely forgot about it. But Mitsuha had come to Tokyo\ncarrying the weight of all those feelings, had been hurt badly, gone back to her\nown town, and cut her hair.\nThere's a lump in my throat. Still, there's nothing I can do about it now, so I\njust keep running, hell for leather. My (Mitsuha's) face and body are smeared\nwith sweat and dirt. The next thing I know, the trees have ended, and I'm in a\nrocky, mossy area, with clouds like a golden carpet below me.\nI've finally reached the peak.\nI suck in a huge chestful of cold air. Then, as if I'm expelling all my\nemotions from the pit of my stomach, I yell at the top of my lungs.\n\"Mitsuhaaaa!\"\nI hear a voice.\nI lift my head. I stand, looking around.\nI'm up on the rocky area surrounding the body of the god's basin. The\nevening sun is almost gone, and all the shadows are stretched and elongated.\nThe world is divided sharply into light and darkness, but there's no one\naround.\n\".. .Taki?\" I murmur.\nI draw in a deep breath of cold air. Then I shout, using Taki's throat:\n\"Takiiii!\"\nI hear it.\nShe's here. Mitsuha is here.\nI set off running, climbing the slope up to the mountain's peak.\nI do a complete 360 scan of the area, but no one's there... She has to be\nhere, though. I feel it in my core.\n\"Mitsuhaaa! You're here, aren't you? In my body!\"\nIt's Taki!\nI'm sure of it. I shout a question into the empty sky:\n\"Taki! Taki, where are you?! I can hear you, but I can't\u2014!\"\nI start sprinting around the rim of the basin.\nI can hear a voice. Just a voice.\nI don't really know whether it\u2014my voice, Mitsuha's voice\u2014is actually\ncreating sound or whether it's just echoing in something like my soul. After all,\neven if we're in the same place, we must still be three years apart.\n\"Mitsuha, where are you?!\"\nEven so, I shout. I can't not shout. I sprint around the edge of the basin with\neverything I've got. If I do\u2014\nIf I do, I'll catch up to Taki. I run, spurred on by that delusion.\n\"Oh!\"\nCrying out in spite of myself, I stop.\nI stop, hastily looking back.\nJust now, I'm positive I passed her.\nThere's a warm presence in front of me. My heart is leaping in my chest.\nI can't see him, but I know Taki's here, very close to me.\nMy heart is racing.\nHe's here. I reach out my hand.\nShe's here. I reach out my hand.\n.. .But my fingers touch nothing.\n\"Mitsuha?\"\nI wait for a response. Nobody answers.\nIt's no good, then? We can't meet? One more time, I look around. I'm\nstanding stock-still, up on the mountain, all alone.\nAt my wits' end, I lower my head and let out a long, thin breath.\nThe wind blows gently, softly lifting my hair. My sweat has dried\ncompletely. Sensing a sudden drop in the temperature, I glance at the evening\nsun. While I was distracted, it slipped below the clouds. Released from direct\nsunlight, light and shadow melt together, and the world's outlines grow soft and\nvague. The sky is still bright, but the Earth is enveloped in pale shadows. The\nair is filled with pink, indirect light.\nThat's right. There were names for this time of day. Twilight, tasogare. The\ntime when the outlines blur, when you might encounter something not of this\nworld. I murmur its old name.\nHalf-light.\nOur voices overlap.\nIt can't be.\nSlowly, I shift my gaze away from the clouds to the space right in front of\nme.\nMitsuha's there.\nShe's watching me, eyes wide and round, mouth hanging open.\nThat lame expression strikes me as funny and lovable. The emotion is\nstronger than my surprise, and, slowly, I start to smile.\n\"Mitsuha.\"\nWhen I call to her, Mitsuha's eyes rapidly fill with tears.\n\".. .Taki? Taki? Taki? Taki?\"\nAs she repeats herself like an idiot, her hands find my arms. Her fingers\ntighten, squeezing.\n\"Taki, you're here for real!\"\nHer voice sounds hoarse and tight. Big tears roll down her cheeks.\nWe've finally met. Really met. We're facing each other, Mitsuha as\nMitsuha, me as myself, in our own bodies. I feel deeply relieved. A sense of\nprofound peace wells up inside me, as if, after being abroad for a long time in\na country where I didn't know the language, I've finally come home. A calm\njoy fills me.\nMitsuha just keeps sobbing.\n\"I came to see you,\" I tell her.\nHer tears are as clear and round as little marbles.\nI smile and keep going. \"Seriously, it was a rough trip! You're way out\nhere.\"\nThat's right: way, way out here. Somewhere even the time is different.\nMitsuha looks at me, blinking.\n\"Huh? But... How? Back then, I...\"\n\"I drank the sake you made.\"\nAs I tell her, remembering how much I've gone through for this, Mitsuha's\ntears stop dead.\n\"Huh...?\"\nShe's speechless. Well, sure she is. Anybody would be really moved by\nthat, right?\n\"Y...y...\"\nSlowly, Mitsuha backs away from me... Hmm?\n\"Y.. .you drank that?!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Idiot! Pervert!\"\n\"Huh\u2014? Wha...?!\"\nHer face is bright red. Apparently, she's mad. Wait, is that something to get\nmad about?!\n\"Oh, and\u2014! You touched my chest, didn't you?!\"\n\"What?!\" I'm completely rattled. \"H-how do you know about...?\"\n\"Yotsuha saw you!\" Mitsuha plants her hands on her hips, talking as though\nshe's scolding a child.\n\"Uh, yeah, sorry... I just...\" Teh! Rotten little blabbermouth. My palms are\ngetting sweaty. An excuse. I've gotta give her an excuse. On the spur of the\nmoment, I blurt out, \"Once! It was just once!\"\nLike that's any kind of excuse! I'm a moron!\n\"... Just once? Hmm...\"\nHuh? She's considering it. So \"just once\" is okay? I might actually get\nthrough this. However, as if correcting herself, Mitsuha's eyebrows come\ndown.\n\"No, it's the same no matter how many times you do it! Idiot!\"\nSo it's not going to work. Giving up, I clap my hands together and duck my\nhead in apology. \"Sorry!\" I really can't tell her that I actually felt 'em up every\ntime.\n\"Oh, that's...\"\nMitsuha's expression changes abruptly. She points at my right hand in\nsurprise. I glance at my wrist.\n\"Oh, yeah. This.\"\nIt's the braided cord. The one she gave me three years ago. I undo the little\nmetal fastener that keeps it in place and unwind it from my wrist, talking to\nMitsuha as I work.\n\"Listen, don't come visit me before we meet. How was I supposed to know\nit was you?\" I hand the cord to Mitsuha. \"Here.\" Remembering what she felt on\nthat train, a softness fills my chest. \"I've had it for three years. This time, you\nhang on to it.\"\nMitsuha looks up from the cord in her hands and smiles happily. \"Uh-huh!\"\nWhen she smiles\u2014 I hadn't noticed before, but it's like the whole world is\nhappy right along with her.\nMitsuha wraps the cord around her head vertically, like a headband, and\nties it into a bow over her left ear.\n\"How's this?\" She blushes, looking up at me through her lashes. The\nbraided cord bounces at the side of her bob, like a ribbon.\n\"Uh...\"\nIt doesn't really work, I think. It's sort of little-kiddish. And she didn't\nhave to chop off that much hair. First she shows up without asking, then she\ngets traumatized for no reason... I like long black hair, all right?\nThat's my immediate reaction. In cases like this, though, compliments are\nthe best move. Even I know that. Even the Conversation skills for the person\nwho's never, ever been the tiniest bit popular! link Mitsuha sent me said it\nwas always safe to compliment women.\n\".. .Well, it's not bad.\"\n\"Wha\u2014?!\" Mitsuha's expression immediately clouds over. Huh?\n\"You don't think it looks good on me!\"\n\"Huh?!\" How'd she know?!\n\"Ha...ha-ha... Sorry.\"\n\"Honestly! You're such a...!\"\nShe turns her face away, thoroughly disgusted. What is this? Talking to girls\nis friggin' impossible...\nThen Mitsuha bursts out laughing. She holds her sides, giggling. What's\nwith her, anyway? Crying and getting mad and laughing... Still, watching her,\nthe urge starts building inside me, too. I look down, put a hand over my face,\nand chuckle. Mitsuha's cracking up right along with me. For some reason,\nwe've started enjoying ourselves. We laugh out loud together. In our corner of\nthe softly shining, half-lit world, we giggle and titter like little kids.\nBit by bit, the temperature is falling. Little by little, the light is fading.\n\"Mitsuha.\"\nI suddenly remember the way I felt when I was a kid, when I'd played my\nheart out after school, wanting to stay with my friends for hours and hours\nlonger but knowing it was almost time to go home.\n\"You've still got things you need to do. Listen.\"\nI outline the plan for her that I'd hatched with Teshigawara and Saya. As\nshe listens, Mitsuha nods seriously, and I realize she remembers that the star\nfell, that the town vanished. That she died once. For her, tonight is a\nreenactment.\n\"It's here...\"\nMitsuha looks up at the sky, and as she whispers, her voice trembles\nslightly. I follow her gaze. In the western sky, which is turning a deep, dark\nblue, the shape of long-tailed Comet Tiamat is faintly visible.\n\"It's all right. You'll make it.\" I say this definitively, as much to convince\nmyself as anything.\n\"Yes, I'll try... Oh, half-light's already\u2014\"\nBefore I know it, Mitsuha's turned the color of pale shadows, too.\n\"\u2014It's already over,\" I finish. The last traces of the evening sun are fading\nfrom the sky. Night will be here soon. As if to shove down the anxiety suddenly\namassing inside me, I force a smile and speak cheerfully. \"Hey, Mitsuha. So\nwe don't forget each other after we wake up...\" I take a felt-tip pen from my\npocket. I catch Mitsuha's right hand, then write on her palm \"Let's write down\nour names. Here.\"\nI give the pen to Mitsuha.\nShe breaks into a smile. It's like watching a flower bloom. She takes my\nright hand and sets the tip of the pen against it.\nTunk.\nThere's a tiny, hard noise by my feet. I look down, and there's the pen on\nthe ground.\n\"Huh?\" I raise my head.\nThere's nobody in front of me.\n\"What...?\"\nI turn this way and that.\n\"Mitsuha? Hey, Mitsuha?\"\nI call louder. No response. Unnerved, I pace the area. The shadows are\nsinking into blue-black darkness. Below me are leaden, featureless clouds, and\nin the gloom below them, I can just make out gourd-shaped Itomori Lake.\nMitsuha's gone.\nNight is here.",

Almost no cars pass us,\nand we're starting to see the lights of scattered houses along the dark\nprefectural road. We're heading for an area between the slopes of the\nmountains, where the lights are concentrated: Miyamizu Shrine, the site of the\nautumn festival. Out of nowhere, I feel an odd nostalgia, as if I've come back\nhome after a long time away.\n\"Mitsuha, she wants to talk to you.\"\n\"Hello? Saya?!\" I put the smartphone to my own ear.\n\"Waaaaaah, Mitsuhaaaa!\" Saya sounds like she's in tears. \"C'mon, do I\nreally have to do this?!\"\nHer anxious voice sends a pang through my heart. If I were in her shoes, I'd\nprobably be crying, too. Even sneaking by yourself into the broadcasting room\nat night is something you'd do only for a friend.\n\"Saya, I'm sorry, but Embeggin' you! Please!\" At this point, that's all I can\nsay. \"I'll never ask you for anythin' else as long as I live, but if we don't do\nthis, a lot of people are gonna die! Once you start the announcement, repeat it\nfor as long as you can!\"\nThere's no response. All I can hear from the receiver are little muffled\nsniffling noises.\n\"Saya? Saya!\"\nI start getting nervous.\nAbruptly, I hear a tiny voice. \"Okay! Agh, I don't even care anymore! You\ntell Tesshi he better buy me somethin', too!\"\n\"What'd she say?\"\nPutting the smartphone in my skirt pocket, I yell back loud enough to be\nheard over the moped's engine. \"That you better buy her somethin', too!\"\n\"Awright, let's do this!\"\nTesshi shouts determinedly, as if trying to suppress something, and just then,\nbehind us, there's a bang like a big firework bursting.",

In slow motion, an enormous\ntransmission tower begins tilting.\n\"Tesshi...!\"\nMy voice quavers.\n\"Ha-ha!\"\nTesshi's breath is shaky, too. It sounds like a laugh.\nThere's an even bigger explosion, and the lights of the town instantly go\ndark.\n\"Hey,\" Tesshi intones, sounding kind of dazed.\n\"The power's out,\" I say, stating the obvious.\nIt worked. We did it.\nSuddenly, sirens well up, beginning to wail.\n000OOOOOOOO000000...!\nThe earsplitting noise reverberates from speakers all over town. It's an\nominous sound, like a giant's scream, and it ricochets off the mountains,\npervading the area.\nIt's Saya. She's hijacked the wireless disaster prevention system\nWe exchange wordless nods, then straddle the moped again. As we race\ntoward the shrine, the speakers broadcasting Saya's voice spur us on. Slowly,\ncalmly, as if her earlier tearful cries were fake, she delivers the message we\ncame up with:\n\"This is Town Hall. An explosion has occurred at Itomori Substation.\nThere is a danger of further explosions and forest fires.\"\nTesshi's moped goes off the prefectural road and climbs up a narrow\nmountain track. It's the gentler slope up to the shrine\u2014this way, we can take\nthe moped all the way to the back of the main building and avoid the stone\nstairs on the shrine approach. The seat shakes violently, and I cling to Tesshi's\nback as I listen to Saya's voice booming through the town. She sounds exactly\nlike her big sister. Nobody would suspect this isn't a broadcast from the town\nhall.\n\"People in the following districts are requested to evacuate to Itomori\nHigh School immediately. Kadoiri District, Sakagami District, Miyamori\nDistrict, Oyazawa District...\"\n\"This's it. C'mon, Mitsuha!\"\n\"Right!\"\nWe leap off the moped and run down the set of wooden steps up the slope\nof the mountain behind the shrine. From between the trees, I can see the roofs\nof the long rows of stalls set up on the shrine grounds and the people milling\naround among them, like fish crowded too closely in a dark tank. As we run,\nwe take off our helmets and throw them away.\n\"I repeat: This is Itomori Town Hall. An explosion has occurred at the\nsubstation. There is a danger of further explosions and forest fires...\"\nWhen we hit the bottom of the stairs, we're behind the main shrine building.\nThe silhouettes of the people gathered for the festival are just ahead, and I hear\nan uneasy murmur. Tesshi and I dash into their midst as if we're racing each\nother, yelling.\n\"Ruuun! A forest fire's cornin'! This place ain't safe!\"\nTesshi's voice is unbelievably loud, like he's using a megaphone. I shout,\ntoo, determined not to be outdone. \"Please run! There's a forest fire! Run!\" We\nemerge in the very center of the grounds.\n\"Yeah, they said there really is a forest fire!\"\n\"C'mon, let's get outta here.\"\n\"We're walkin' all the way to the high school?\"\nThe broadcast set the evacuation in motion, and our shouts are pushing it\nalong. Men and women in traditional wear, children, and old people holding\ntheir grandkids' hands all begin filing toward the shrine gate at the exit. I'm\nrelieved. If things go on like this, we'll make it for sure. It's all thanks to\nhim... \"Him\"?\n\"Mitsuha!\"\nTesshi calls my name sharply. I look up at him.\n\"This ain't good!\"\nFollowing his gaze around us, I see lots of people sitting down and taking it\neasy by the stalls or standing, idly talking. They're even smoking cigarettes or\ndrinking, chatting away and enjoying the evening.\n\"There's no way we're movin' all these folks unless an actual forest fire\ncomes through! We have to get them to send out the fire brigade and direct the\nevacuation. You get to the town hall, and this time make sure the mayor...\"\nTesshi's flustered voice is right above my head, but it sounds terribly far\naway... Him?\n\"Hey. Mitsuha? What's up?\"\n\"...Tesshi, listen, what'll I do?\"\nMy mind isn't working, and before I know it, I'm pleading to Tesshi.\n\"His name... I can't remember his name!\"\nTesshi's face twists with worry. Suddenly, he yells at me. \"Who the hell\ncares, you idiot?! Look around! You started all this!\"\nHe's glaring at me, furious. Belatedly, I notice that Saya's call to \"Please\nevacuate to Itomori High School\" is now erratic, as if she's about to burst\ninto tears.\n\"Mitsuha, go !\" Tesshi gives a heartrending yell, practically begging this\ntime. \"Go talk your dad around!\"\nMy spine straightens as though he's slapped me across the face.\n\"...Right!\"\nI nod as firmly as I can, then bolt into a sprint, trying to shake myself free.\nBehind me, I hear Tesshi scream again. \"I said run, y'all! Get to the high\nschool!\"",

My coffee cup rattles in my fingers as they tremble\nwith humiliation.\nTweedle.\nMy phone chirps from the table. I check the message, drain what's left of\nmy coffee in one gulp, and stand.\nCome to think of it, the three of us came to this cafe a lot when we were in\nhigh school. The memory strikes me after I've waved good-bye to Tsukasa and\nTakagi and started jogging toward the station. Life was so carefree back then. I\ndidn't have to think about the future or finding a job, and somehow, every day\nwas ludicrously fun. Especially that one summer\u2014I think it was during my\nsecond year of high school. It seems like that summer was especially thrilling.\nWhat happened that year? I think back and conclude there wasn't anything in\nparticular. I guess I must've just been at an age when absolutely anything was\nenough to trigger a giggling fit.\n...Wait, no, that's something they say about girls... Absentmindedly, I hop\ndown the stairs to the subway.\n\"Ooh. Job hunting, hmm?\"\nOkudera-senpai looks up from her phone, sees me in my suit, and smiles.\nIt's evening, and the area in front of Yotsuya Station is filled with the faintly\nlanguid hum of people released from their days at work or school.\n\"Ha-ha. Well, it's not going so great.\"\n\"Hmm...\" Okudera-senpai murmurs, bringing her face closer to mine. She\ninspects me from head to toe with a frown. Then, gravely, she asks, \"You don't\nthink it's because suits don't look good on you?\"\n\"I-is it really that bad?!\" Involuntarily, I look down at myself.\n\"Oh, come on, I'mjoking!\"\nOkudera-senpai beams, her expression changing easily.\n\"Let's walk a little,\" Okudera-senpai says, and I follow her. We set off,\ngoing against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut\nacross Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that\nthe trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass\nhave on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,\ntoo.\n\"What's going on today? Your text came out of the blue.\"\nFeeling as if I'm the only one who hasn't kept up with the season, I turn to\nOkudera-senpai beside me.\n\"What?\" Her glossy lips pout. \"I can't get in touch with you without a\nreason?\"\n\"No, no, no!\" I wave my hands hastily.\n\"You're happy to see me, aren't you? It's been a long time.\"\n\"Y-yes. I am.\"\nShe smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. \"I was in the area\nfor work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki.\" She was hired by a major\nclothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. \"Life in the suburbs\nis fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind,\" she tells me, gazing at\nher surroundings like she's a little awestruck. \"Look,\" she says suddenly, and I\nraise my head.\nWe're crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we're eye level with the giant\noutdoor display screen above an electronics store. It's showing aerial footage\nof gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster\u2014Eight\nYears Later in big letters.\n\"We went to Itomori once, didn't we?\" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,\nas though she's searching distant memories. \"You were still in high school,\nTaki, so it must've been...\"\n\"Five years ago, maybe?\" I finish the sentence for her.\n\"That long...\" She exhales a little, as if surprised. \"I'm forgetting all sorts\nof things.\"\nShe's right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk\nup Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I\ntry remembering that day.\nIt was the summer of my second year in high school\u2014 No, it was just about\nthis time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short\ntrip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way\nto Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.\nRight, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the\nside of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur\nand grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a\nvague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed\na mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to\nTokyo by myself the next day.\nThat's right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that\ncomet.\nIn the sort of natural disaster that's happened only a few times in human\nhistory, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,\nalmost all the town's residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the\ncomet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and\nmost of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.\nIt was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all\nsorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical\nphenomenon and the townspeople's stupendous luck were enough to stir up the\nmedia's and public's imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around\nwildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet's visit\nwith Itomori's dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or\nquestioned the mayor of Itomori's use of plenary power in forcing an\nevacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been\nforetold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so\nisolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the\npower across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite\nstrike, spurred public speculation. Society's excitement lasted until the\nprograms to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as\nwith most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of\nItomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.\nStill... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I'd even drawn sketches of\nItomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had\nmaterialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had\nvisited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.\nWhat in the world had it been?",
