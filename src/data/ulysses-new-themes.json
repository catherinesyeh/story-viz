      "first_line": 1,

      "text": "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of\nlather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow\ndressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild\nmorning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:\n\u2014_Introibo ad altare Dei_.\nHalted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:\n\u2014Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!\nSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about\nand blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the\nawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent\ntowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat\nand shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned\nhis arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking\ngurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light\nuntonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.\nBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the\nbowl smartly.\n\u2014Back to barracks! he said sternly.\nHe added in a preacher's tone:\n\u2014For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul\nand blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One\nmoment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.\nHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused\nawhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and\nthere with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles\nanswered through the calm.\n\u2014Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off\nthe current, will you?\nHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering\nabout his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and\nsullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.\nA pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.\n\u2014The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!\nHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,\nlaughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily\nhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as\nhe propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and\nlathered cheeks and neck.\nBuck Mulligan's gay voice went on.\n\u2014My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a\nHellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We\nmust go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out\ntwenty quid?\nHe laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:\n\u2014Will he come? The jejune jesuit!\nCeasing, he began to shave with care.\n\u2014Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.\n\u2014Yes, my love?\n\u2014How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?\nBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.\n\u2014God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks\nyou're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money\nand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you\nhave the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you\nis the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.\nHe shaved warily over his chin.\n\u2014He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is\nhis guncase?\n\u2014A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?\n\u2014I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark\nwith a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a\nblack panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If\nhe stays on here I am off.\nBuck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down\nfrom his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.\n\u2014Scutter! he cried thickly.\nHe came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper\npocket, said:\n\u2014Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.\nStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a\ndirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.\nThen, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:\n\u2014The bard's noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.\nYou can almost taste it, can't you?\nHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair\noakpale hair stirring slightly.\n\u2014God! he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet\nmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa\nponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them\nin the original. _Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.\nCome and look.\nStephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked\ndown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of\nKingstown.\n\u2014Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.\nHe turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's\nface.\n\u2014The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't\nlet me have anything to do with you.\n\u2014Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.\n\u2014You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother\nasked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to\nthink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and\npray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....\nHe broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant\nsmile curled his lips.\n\u2014But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest\nmummer of them all!\nHe shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.\nStephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against\nhis brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.\nPain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently,\nin a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within\nits loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,\nher breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of\nwetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a\ngreat sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and\nskyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had\nstood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had\ntorn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.\nBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.\n\u2014Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt\nand a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?\n\u2014They fit well enough, Stephen answered.\nBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.\n\u2014The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God\nknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair\nstripe, grey. You'll look spiffing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch. You\nlook damn well when you're dressed.\n\u2014Thanks, Stephen said. I can't wear them if they are grey.\n\u2014He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.\nEtiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can't wear grey\ntrousers.\nHe folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the\nsmooth skin.\nStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its\nsmokeblue mobile eyes.\n\u2014That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,\nsays you have g. p. i. He's up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.\nGeneral paralysis of the insane!\nHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings\nabroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips\nlaughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized\nall his strong wellknit trunk.\n\u2014Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!\nStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by\na crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this\nface for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.\n\u2014I pinched it out of the skivvy's room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her\nall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.\nLead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.\nLaughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes.\n\u2014The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If\nWilde were only alive to see you!\nDrawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:\n\u2014It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.\nBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him\nround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he\nhad thrust them.\n\u2014It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.\nGod knows you have more spirit than any of them.\nParried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The\ncold steel pen.\n\u2014Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap\ndownstairs and touch him for a guinea. He's stinking with money and\nthinks you're not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling\njalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and\nI could only work together we might do something for the island.\nHellenise it.\nCranly's arm. His arm.\n\u2014And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I'm the only one\nthat knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more? What have you up\nyour nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I'll\nbring down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave\nClive Kempthorpe.\nYoung shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. Palefaces:\nthey hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall\nexpire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit\nribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the\ntable, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the\ntailor's shears. A scared calf's face gilded with marmalade. I don't\nwant to be debagged! Don't you play the giddy ox with me!\nShouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf\ngardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower\non the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.\nTo ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.\n\u2014Let him stay, Stephen said. There's nothing wrong with him except at\nnight.\n\u2014Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I'm\nquite frank with you. What have you against me now?\nThey halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on\nthe water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm\nquietly.\n\u2014Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.\n\u2014Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don't remember anything.\nHe looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,\nfanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of\nanxiety in his eyes.\nStephen, depressed by his own voice, said:\n\u2014Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother's\ndeath?\nBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:\n\u2014What? Where? I can't remember anything. I remember only ideas and\nsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?\n\u2014You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get\nmore hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the\ndrawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.\n\u2014Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.\n\u2014You said, Stephen answered, _O, it's only Dedalus whose mother is\nbeastly dead._\nA flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck\nMulligan's cheek.\n\u2014Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?\nHe shook his constraint from him nervously.\n\u2014And what is death, he asked, your mother's or yours or my own? You saw\nonly your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and\nRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It's a beastly\nthing and nothing else. It simply doesn't matter. You wouldn't kneel\ndown to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?\nBecause you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected\nthe wrong way. To me it's all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes\nare not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks\nbuttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it's over. You crossed her\nlast wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don't whinge like\nsome hired mute from Lalouette's. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I\ndidn't mean to offend the memory of your mother.\nHe had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping\nwounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:\n\u2014I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.\n\u2014Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.\n\u2014Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.\nBuck Mulligan swung round on his heel.\n\u2014O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.\nHe walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,\ngazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now\ngrew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he\nfelt the fever of his cheeks.\nA voice within the tower called loudly:\n\u2014Are you up there, Mulligan?\n\u2014I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered.\nHe turned towards Stephen and said:\n\u2014Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,\nKinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.\nHis head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level\nwith the roof:\n\u2014Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the\nmoody brooding.\nHis head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of\nthe stairhead:\nAnd no more turn aside and brood",

      "text": "Upon love's bitter mystery\nFor Fergus rules the brazen cars.\nWoodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the\nstairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of\nwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the\ndim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the\nharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words\nshimmering on the dim tide.\nA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in\ndeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus'\nsong: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.\nHer door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and\npity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For\nthose words, Stephen: love's bitter mystery.\nWhere now?\nHer secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,\na gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the\nsunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing\nin the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he\nsang:\nI am the boy\nThat can enjoy\nInvisibility.\nPhantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.\nAnd no more turn aside and brood.\nFolded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his\nbrooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had\napproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,\nroasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely\nfingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's\nshirts.\nIn a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its\nloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,\nbent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.\nHer glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On\nme alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the\ntortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all\nprayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata\nrutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum\nchorus excipiat._\nGhoul! Chewer of corpses!\nNo, mother! Let me be and let me live.\n\u2014Kinch ahoy!\nBuck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the\nstaircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry,\nheard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.\n\u2014Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is\napologising for waking us last night. It's all right.\n\u2014I'm coming, Stephen said, turning.\n\u2014Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our\nsakes.\nHis head disappeared and reappeared.\n\u2014I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it's very clever. Touch\nhim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.\n\u2014I get paid this morning, Stephen said.\n\u2014The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.\n\u2014If you want it, Stephen said.\n\u2014Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We'll have\na glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent\nsovereigns.\nHe flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of\ntune with a Cockney accent:\nO, won't we have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\nOn coronation,\nCoronation day!\nO, won't we have a merry time\nOn coronation day!\nWarm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,\nforgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it\nthere all day, forgotten friendship?\nHe went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,\nsmelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.\nSo I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now\nand yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.\nIn the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form\nmoved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its\nyellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor\nfrom the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of\ncoalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.\n\u2014We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?\nStephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the\nhammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open\nthe inner doors.\n\u2014Have you the key? a voice asked.\n\u2014Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I'm choked!\nHe howled, without looking up from the fire:\n\u2014Kinch!\n\u2014It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.\nThe key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been\nset ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the\ndoorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and\nsat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside\nhim. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set\nthem down heavily and sighed with relief.\n\u2014I'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a\nword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.\nHaines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy\ngifts. Where's the sugar? O, jay, there's no milk.\nStephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from\nthe locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.\n\u2014What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.\n\u2014We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There's a lemon in the\nlocker.\n\u2014O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove\nmilk.\nHaines came in from the doorway and said quietly:\n\u2014That woman is coming up with the milk.\n\u2014The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his\nchair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,\nI can't go fumbling at the damned eggs.\nHe hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three\nplates, saying:\n\u2014_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._\nHaines sat down to pour out the tea.\n\u2014I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do\nmake strong tea, don't you?\nBuck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old\nwoman's wheedling voice:\n\u2014When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I\nmakes water I makes water.\n\u2014By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.\nBuck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:\n\u2014_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma'am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God\nsend you don't make them in the one pot._\nHe lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled\non his knife.\n\u2014That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines\nof text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of\nDundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.\nHe turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his\nbrows:\n\u2014Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken\nof in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?\n\u2014I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.\n\u2014Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?\n\u2014I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the\nMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.\nBuck Mulligan's face smiled with delight.\n\u2014Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth\nand blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!\nThen, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened\nrasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:\n_\u2014For old Mary Ann\nShe doesn't care a damn.\nBut, hising up her petticoats..._\nHe crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.\nThe doorway was darkened by an entering form.\n\u2014The milk, sir!\n\u2014Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.\nAn old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow.\n\u2014That's a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.\n\u2014To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!\nStephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.\n\u2014The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of\nthe collector of prepuces.\n\u2014How much, sir? asked the old woman.\n\u2014A quart, Stephen said.\nHe watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white\nmilk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a\ntilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a\nmessenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.\nCrouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on\nher toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They\nlowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and\npoor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly\nform of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their\ncommon cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to\nupbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.\n\u2014It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.\n\u2014Taste it, sir, she said.\nHe drank at her bidding.\n\u2014If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat\nloudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten\nguts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved\nwith dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits.\n\u2014Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.\n\u2014I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan answered.\n\u2014Look at that now, she said.\nStephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice\nthat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she\nslights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there\nis of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in\nGod's likeness, the serpent's prey. And to the loud voice that now bids\nher be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.\n\u2014Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.\n\u2014Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.\nHaines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.\n\u2014Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?\n\u2014I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the\nwest, sir?\n\u2014I am an Englishman, Haines answered.\n\u2014He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak\nIrish in Ireland.\n\u2014Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak\nthe language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows.\n\u2014Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill\nus out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma'am?\n\u2014No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the\nmilkcan on her forearm and about to go.\nHaines said to her:\n\u2014Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?\nStephen filled again the three cups.\n\u2014Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it's seven mornings a pint at\ntwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three\nmornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That's a\nshilling and one and two is two and two, sir.\nBuck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly\nbuttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search\nhis trouser pockets.\n\u2014Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.\nStephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the\nthick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in\nhis fingers and cried:\n\u2014A miracle!\nHe passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:\n\u2014Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.\nStephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.\n\u2014We'll owe twopence, he said.\n\u2014Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good\nmorning, sir.\nShe curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant:\n_\u2014Heart of my heart, were it more,\nMore would be laid at your feet._\nHe turned to Stephen and said:\n\u2014Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring\nus back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland\nexpects that every man this day will do his duty.",

      "text": "\u2014That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your\nnational library today.\n\u2014Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.\nHe turned to Stephen and asked blandly:\n\u2014Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?\nThen he said to Haines:\n\u2014The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.\n\u2014All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey\ntrickle over a slice of the loaf.\nHaines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the\nloose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:\n\u2014I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.\nSpeaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.\nConscience. Yet here's a spot.\n\u2014That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol\nof Irish art is deuced good.\nBuck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and said with\nwarmth of tone:\n\u2014Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.\n\u2014Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just\nthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.\n\u2014Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.\nHaines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of\nthe hammock, said:\n\u2014I don't know, I'm sure.\nHe strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen\nand said with coarse vigour:\n\u2014You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?\n\u2014Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the\nmilkwoman or from him. It's a toss up, I think.\n\u2014I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along\nwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.\n\u2014I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.\nBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm.\n\u2014From me, Kinch, he said.\nIn a suddenly changed tone he added:\n\u2014To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. Damn all else they\nare good for. Why don't you play them as I do? To hell with them all.\nLet us get out of the kip.\nHe stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying\nresignedly:\n\u2014Mulligan is stripped of his garments.\nHe emptied his pockets on to the table.\n\u2014There's your snotrag, he said.\nAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,\nchiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and\nrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,\nwe'll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green\nboots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I\ncontradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of\nhis talking hands.\n\u2014And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said.\nStephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the\ndoorway:\n\u2014Are you coming, you fellows?\n\u2014I'm ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,\nKinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out\nwith grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:\n\u2014And going forth he met Butterly.\nStephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out\nand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and\nlocked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.\nAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:\n\u2014Did you bring the key?\n\u2014I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.\nHe walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy\nbathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.\n\u2014Down, sir! How dare you, sir!\nHaines asked:\n\u2014Do you pay rent for this tower?\n\u2014Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.\n\u2014To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.\nThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:\n\u2014Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?\n\u2014Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on\nthe sea. But ours is the _omphalos_.\n\u2014What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.\n\u2014No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas\nand the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I\nhave a few pints in me first.\nHe turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his\nprimrose waistcoat:\n\u2014You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?\n\u2014It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.\n\u2014You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?\n\u2014Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.\nIt's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is\nShakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own\nfather.\n\u2014What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?\nBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in\nloose laughter, said to Stephen's ear:\n\u2014O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!\n\u2014We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is\nrather long to tell.\nBuck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.\n\u2014The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.\n\u2014I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this\ntower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That\nbeetles o'er his base into the sea,_ isn't it?\nBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did\nnot speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in\ncheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.\n\u2014It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.\nEyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.\nThe seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the\nsmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail\ntacking by the Muglins.\n\u2014I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.\nThe Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the\nFather.\nBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked\nat them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had\nsuddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved\na doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and\nbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:\n_\u2014I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.\nMy mother's a jew, my father's a bird.\nWith Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.\nSo here's to disciples and Calvary._\nHe held up a forefinger of warning.\n_\u2014If anyone thinks that I amn't divine\nHe'll get no free drinks when I'm making the wine\nBut have to drink water and wish it were plain\nThat I make when the wine becomes water again._\nHe tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running\nforward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like\nfins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:\n_\u2014Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said\nAnd tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.\nWhat's bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly\nAnd Olivet's breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_\nHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his\nwinglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in the fresh\nwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.\nHaines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and\nsaid:\n\u2014We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not a\nbeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of\nit somehow, doesn't it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?\n\u2014The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.\n\u2014O, Haines said, you have heard it before?\n\u2014Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.\n\u2014You're not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in\nthe narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a\npersonal God.\n\u2014There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.\nHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a\ngreen stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.\n\u2014Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.\nHaines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his\nsidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang\nit open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk\ntowards Stephen in the shell of his hands.\n\u2014Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or\nyou don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a\npersonal God. You don't stand for that, I suppose?\n\u2014You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible\nexample of free thought.\nHe walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his\nside. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.\nMy familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line\nalong the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.\nHe wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt\nbread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his\neyes.\n\u2014After all, Haines began...\nStephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was\nnot all unkind.\n\u2014After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your\nown master, it seems to me.\n\u2014I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an\nItalian.\n\u2014Italian? Haines said.\nA crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.\n\u2014And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.\n\u2014Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?\n\u2014The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and\nthe holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\nHaines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he\nspoke.\n\u2014I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think\nlike that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you\nrather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\nThe proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph of\ntheir brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam\necclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own\nrare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass\nfor pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in\naffirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church\nmilitant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies\nfleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom\nMulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the\nconsubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning\nChrist's terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who\nheld that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken\na moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void\nawaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a\nworsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael's host, who\ndefend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their\nshields.\nHear, hear! Prolonged applause. _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_\n\u2014Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines's voice said, and I feel as one. I\ndon't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.\nThat's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now.\nTwo men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,\nboatman.\n\u2014She's making for Bullock harbour.\nThe boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.\n\u2014There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way\nwhen the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today.\nThe man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting\nfor a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,\nsaltwhite. Here I am.\nThey followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood\non a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his\nshoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly\nfrogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.\n\u2014Is the brother with you, Malachi?\n\u2014Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.\n\u2014Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young\nthing down there. Photo girl he calls her.\n\u2014Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.\nBuck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near\nthe spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,\nwater glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water\nrilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black\nsagging loincloth.\nBuck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines\nand Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and\nlips and breastbone.\n\u2014Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of\nrock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.\n\u2014Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.\n\u2014Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?\n\u2014Yes.\n\u2014Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with\nmoney.\n\u2014Is she up the pole?\n\u2014Better ask Seymour that.\n\u2014Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.\nHe nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying\ntritely:\n\u2014Redheaded women buck like goats.\nHe broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.\n\u2014My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the _\u00dcbermensch._ Toothless\nKinch and I, the supermen.\nHe struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his\nclothes lay.\n\u2014Are you going in here, Malachi?\n\u2014Yes. Make room in the bed.\nThe young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the\nmiddle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a\nstone, smoking.\n\u2014Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.\n\u2014Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.\nStephen turned away.\n\u2014I'm going, Mulligan, he said.\n\u2014Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.\nStephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped\nclothes.\n\u2014And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.\nStephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck\nMulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:\n\u2014He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake\nZarathustra.\nHis plump body plunged.\n\u2014We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the\npath and smiling at wild Irish.\nHorn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.\n\u2014The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.\n\u2014Good, Stephen said.\nHe walked along the upwardcurving path.\nLiliata rutilantium.\nTurma circumdet.\nIubilantium te virginum.\nThe priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will\nnot sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.\nA voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning\nthe curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a\nseal's, far out on the water, round.\nUsurper.",

Mr Deasy said I was to\ncopy them off the board, sir.\n\u2014Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.\n\u2014No, sir.\nUgly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a\nsnail's bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in\nher heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him\nunderfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery\nblood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in\nlife? His mother's prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal\nbestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in\nthe fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from\nbeing trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor\nsoul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red\nreek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the\nearth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.\nSitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by\nalgebra that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather. Sargent\npeered askance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the\nlumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.\nAcross the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of\ntheir letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,\ntraverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from\nthe world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and\nmovement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the\nworld, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not\ncomprehend.\n\u2014Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?\n\u2014Yes, sir.\nIn long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a\nword of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint\nhue of shame flickering behind his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective\nand objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had\nfed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.\nLike him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My\nchildhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or\nlightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony\nsit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their\ntyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.\nThe sum was done.\n\u2014It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.\n\u2014Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.\nHe dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his\ncopybook back to his bench.",

      "text": "illdyed head.\nStale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded\nleather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here.\nAs it was in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart\ncoins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their\nspooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached\nto all the gentiles: world without end.\nA hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his\nrare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.\n\u2014First, our little financial settlement, he said.\nHe brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It\nslapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and\nlaid them carefully on the table.\n\u2014Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.\nAnd now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand moved\nover the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money\ncowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and\nthis, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim's hoard, dead\ntreasure, hollow shells.\nA sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.\n\u2014Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.\nThese are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is\nfor shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.\nHe shot from it two crowns and two shillings.\n\u2014Three twelve, he said. I think you'll find that's right.\n\u2014Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy\nhaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.\n\u2014No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.\nStephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too\nof beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed\nand misery.\n\u2014Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You'll pull it out somewhere\nand lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very\nhandy.\nAnswer something.\n\u2014Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.\nThe same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times\nnow. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant\nif I will.\n\u2014Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don't\nknow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as\nI have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare\nsay? _Put but money in thy purse._\n\u2014Iago, Stephen murmured.\nHe lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare.\n\u2014He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but\nan Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you\nknow what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's\nmouth?\nThe seas' ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems\nhistory is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.\n\u2014That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.\n\u2014Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That's not English. A French Celt said that. He\ntapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.\n\u2014I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. _I paid\nmy way._\nGood man, good man.\n_\u2014I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel\nthat? _I owe nothing._ Can you?\nMulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.\nCurran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.\nTemple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob\nReynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five\nweeks' board. The lump I have is useless.\n\u2014For the moment, no, Stephen answered.\nMr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.\n\u2014I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.\nWe are a generous people but we must also be just.\n\u2014I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.\nMr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the\nshapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of\nWales.\n\u2014You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.\nI saw three generations since O'Connell's time. I remember the famine\nin '46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the\nunion twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your\ncommunion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.\nGlorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the\nsplendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the\nplanters' covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie\ndown.\nStephen sketched a brief gesture.\n\u2014I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But\nI am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are\nall Irish, all kings' sons.\n\u2014Alas, Stephen said.\n\u2014_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for\nit and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to\ndo so.\nLal the ral the ra\nThe rocky road to Dublin.\nA gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!\nSoft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on\nto Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.\n\u2014That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,\nwith some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.\nSit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.\nHe went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read\noff some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.\n\u2014Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of\ncommon sense._ Just a moment.\nHe peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow\nand, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,\nsometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.\nStephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed\naround the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek\nheads poised in air: lord Hastings' _Repulse_, the duke of\nWestminster's _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort's _Ceylon_, _prix de\nParis_, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their\nspeeds, backing king's colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished\ncrowds.\n\u2014Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. _But prompt ventilation of this\nallimportant question..._\nWhere Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the\nmudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek\nof the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to\none the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs,\nthe vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher's\ndame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.\nShouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.\nAgain: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a\nmedley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling\nwho seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock\nby shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of\nthe slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.\n\u2014Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.\nHe came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.\n\u2014I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It's about the\nfoot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two\nopinions on the matter.\nMay I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of _laissez faire_\nwhich so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old\nindustries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.\nEuropean conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the\nchannel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of\nagriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who\nwas no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.\n\u2014I don't mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.\nFoot and mouth disease. Known as Koch's preparation. Serum and virus.\nPercentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor's horses at M\u00fcrzsteg,\nlower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous\noffer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In\nevery sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for\nthe hospitality of your columns.\n\u2014I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the\nnext outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be\ncured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is\nregularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They\noffer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the\ndepartment. Now I'm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by\ndifficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...\nHe raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.\n\u2014Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the\njews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are\nthe signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the\nnation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as\nwe are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of\ndestruction. Old England is dying.\nHe stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a\nbroad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.\n\u2014Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.\nThe harlot's cry from street to street\nShall weave old England's windingsheet.\nHis eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which\nhe halted.\n\u2014A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or\ngentile, is he not?\n\u2014They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see\nthe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the\nearth to this day.\nOn the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting\nprices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,\nuncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit\nsilk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.\nTheir full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and\nunoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their\nzeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would\nscatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.\nTheir eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the\ndishonours of their flesh.\n\u2014Who has not? Stephen said.\n\u2014What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.\nHe came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell\nsideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from\nme.\n\u2014History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\nFrom the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.\nWhat if that nightmare gave you a back kick?\n\u2014The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human\nhistory moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.\nStephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:\n\u2014That is God.\nHooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!\n\u2014What? Mr Deasy asked.\n\u2014A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.\nMr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked\nbetween his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.\n\u2014I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and\nmany sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no\nbetter than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten\nyears the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the\nstrangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman,\nO'Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many\nerrors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the\nend of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.\nFor Ulster will fight\nAnd Ulster will be right.\nStephen raised the sheets in his hand.\n\u2014Well, sir, he began.\n\u2014I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at\nthis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am\nwrong.\n\u2014A learner rather, Stephen said.\nAnd here what will you learn more?\nMr Deasy shook his head.\n\u2014Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great\nteacher.\nStephen rustled the sheets again.\n\u2014As regards these, he began.\n\u2014Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them\npublished at once.\n_ Telegraph. Irish Homestead._\n\u2014I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two\neditors slightly.\n\u2014That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,\nM.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the\nCity Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You\nsee if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?\n_\u2014The Evening Telegraph..._\n\u2014That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to\nanswer that letter from my cousin.\n\u2014Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.\nThank you.\n\u2014Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I\nlike to break a lance with you, old as I am.\n\u2014Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.\nHe went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,\nhearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The\nlions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:\ntoothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will",

Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased\npleasers, curled conquistadores.\nNoon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers\nsmeared with printer's ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his\nwhite. About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. _Un demi\ns\u00e9tier!_ A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves\nme at his beck. _Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux\nirlandais, nous, Irlande, vous savez ah, oui!_ She thought you wanted a\ncheese _hollandais_. Your postprandial, do you know that word?\nPostprandial. There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer\nfellow, used to call it his postprandial. Well: _slainte!_ Around the\nslabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His\nbreath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy's fang\nthrusting between his lips. Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes,\nconspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now, A E, pimander, good shepherd of\nmen. To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause. You're\nyour father's son. I know the voice. His fustian shirt,\nsanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at his secrets. M.\nDrumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called queen\nVictoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. _Vieille ogresse_ with the\n_dents jaunes_. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, _La Patrie_, M. Millevoye,\nF\u00e9lix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The froeken, _bonne \u00e0\ntout faire_, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala. _Moi\nfaire_, she said, _Tous les messieurs_. Not this _Monsieur_, I said.\nMost licentious custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn't let my\nbrother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing. Green eyes, I\nsee you. Fang, I feel. Lascivious people.\nThe blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose\ntobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw\nfacebones under his peep of day boy's hat. How the head centre got\naway, authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil,\norangeblossoms, drove out the road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost\nleaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not\nhere.\nSpurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell\nyou. I'll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her\nlove he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under\nthe walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl\nthem upward in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay\nParee he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his\nday's stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the\nMontmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or,\ndamascened with flyblown faces of the gone. Loveless, landless,\nwifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in\nrue G\u00eet-le-C\u0153ur, canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra\nskirt, frisky as a young thing's. Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat\nyou saw me, won't you? I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time. _Mon\nfils_, soldier of France. I taught him to sing _The boys of Kilkenny\nare stout roaring blades_. Know that old lay? I taught Patrice that.\nOld Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow's castle on the Nore. Goes like\nthis. _O, O_. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.\nO, O the boys of\nKilkenny...\nWeak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.\nRemembering thee, O Sion.\nHe had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.\nThe new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of\nseeds of brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship,\nam I? He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the\nquaking soil. Turn back.\nTurning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in\nnew sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the\nbarbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet\nare sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk,\nnightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness of the dome they wait,\ntheir pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned\nplatters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep there when\nthis night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind\nbodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted\nhis feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take\nall, keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon's\nmidwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing\nElsinore's tempting flood.\nThe flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back\nthen by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge\nand eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a\ngrike.\nA bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the\ngunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. _Un coche ensabl\u00e9_ Louis Veuillot\ncalled Gautier's prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind\nhave silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren\nof weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and\nstones. Heavy of the past. Sir Lout's toys. Mind you don't get one bang\non the ear. I'm the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well\nboulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz\nodz an Iridzman.\nA point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.\nLord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be\nmaster of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From\nfarther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures,\ntwo. The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.\nPeekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?\nGalleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their\nbloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings,\ntorcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the\ncollar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,\nspouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework\ncity a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers' knives,\nrunning, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague\nand slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved\namong them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the\nspluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.\nThe dog's bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I\njust simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. _Terribilia meditans_. A\nprimrose doublet, fortune's knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you\npining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The\nBruce's brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck,\nYork's false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a\nday, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion\ncrowned. All kings' sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved\nmen from drowning and you shake at a cur's yelping. But the courtiers\nwho mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of...\nWe don't want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what\nhe did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. _Nat\u00fcrlich_, put there for\nyou. Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago\noff Maiden's rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it\nout. I would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water\ncold soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can't\nsee! Who's behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing\nquickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly,\nshellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. I want his life still\nto be his, mine to be mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me\nout of horror of his death. I... With him together down... I could not\nsave her. Waters: bitter death: lost.\nA woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.\nTheir dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on\nall sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made\noff like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a\nlowskimming gull. The man's shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He\nturned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a\nfield tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of\nthe tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout\nlifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented\ntowards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth,\nbreaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.\nCocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,\nsoused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped\nrunning to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again\nreared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them\nas they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting\nfrom his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped\noff at a calf's gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped,\nsniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it,\nsniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog's bedraggled fell.\nDogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.

Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun's\nflaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges,\nschlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering,\nmoondrawn, in her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not\nmine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon.\nIn sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed,\nchildbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_.

Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.\nTurning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and\nscribbled words. That's twice I forgot to take slips from the library\ncounter.\nHis shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till\nthe farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness\nshining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there\nwith his augur's rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid\nsea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth\nstars.

Signs on a white\nfield. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.

Darkness is\nin our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our\nsins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the\nmore.\nShe trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue\nhell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality\nof the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at\nHodges Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet\nbooks you were going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through\nthe braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a\ngrief and kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else,\nStevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders\nand yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple\ndumplings, _piuttosto_. Where are your wits?\nTouch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me\nsoon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.\nSad too. Touch, touch me.\nHe lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the\nscribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his\neyes. That is Kevin Egan's movement I made, nodding for his nap,\nsabbath sleep. _Et vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona_. Alo! _Bonjour_.\nWelcome as the flowers in May. Under its leaf he watched through\npeacocktwittering lashes the southing sun. I am caught in this burning\nscene. Pan's hour, the faunal noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants,\nmilkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is\nfar.\nAnd no more turn aside and brood.\nHis gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck's castoffs,\n_nebeneinander_. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein\nanother's foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in\ntripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt's\nshoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. _Tiens, quel petit pied!_\nStaunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde's love that dare not speak its\nname.

No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the\nlow rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a\nfourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of\nwaters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it\nslops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech\nceases. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower\nunfurling.\nUnder the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and\nsway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water\nswaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night:\nlifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,\nthey sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,\nawaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias\npatiens ingemiscit_. To no end gathered; vainly then released,\nforthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of\nlovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws\na toil of waters.\nFive fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he\nsaid. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a\nloose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse\nrising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise\nlandward. There he is. Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath\nthe watery floor. We have him. Easy now.\nBag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a\nspongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God\nbecomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed\nmountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a\nurinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes\nupward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to\nthe sun.\nA seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths\nknown to man. Old Father Ocean. _Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.\nJust you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.\nCome. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?\nThunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,\n_Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_. No. My cockle hat and staff and\nhismy sandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.\nHe took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying\nstill. Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make\ntheir end. By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.\nOf all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn\nTennyson, gentleman poet. _Gi\u00e0_. For the old hag with the yellow teeth.\nAnd Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. _Gi\u00e0_. My teeth are very\nbad. Why, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to\na dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch,\nthe superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?\nMy handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?\nHis hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy one.\nHe laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,\ncarefully. For the rest let look who will.\nBehind. Perhaps there is someone.\nHe turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the\nair high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the\ncrosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.",

      "text": "Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.\nHe liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,\nliverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all he\nliked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of\nfaintly scented urine.\nKidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting\nher breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the\nkitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him\nfeel a bit peckish.\nThe coals were reddening.\nAnother slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn't like\nher plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off\nthe hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat,\nits spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked\nstiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.\n\u2014Mkgnao!\n\u2014O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.\nThe cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the\ntable, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch\nmy head. Prr.\nMr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:\nthe gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her\ntail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his\nknees.\n\u2014Milk for the pussens, he said.\n\u2014Mrkgnao! the cat cried.\nThey call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we\nunderstand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too.\nCruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder\nwhat I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.\n\u2014Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the\nchookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.\n\u2014Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.\nShe blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively\nand long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits\nnarrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to\nthe dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him,\npoured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.\n\u2014Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.\nHe watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped\nthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they\ncan't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or\nkind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.\nHe listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with\nthis drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for\na mutton kidney at Buckley's. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.\nBetter a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. While the kettle is boiling. She\nlapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so\nrough? To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced\nround him. No.\nOn quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by\nthe bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter\nshe likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.\nHe said softly in the bare hall:\n\u2014I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.\nAnd when he had heard his voice say it he added:\n\u2014You don't want anything for breakfast?\nA sleepy soft grunt answered:\n\u2014Mn.\nNo. She didn't want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,\nas she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.\nMust get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.\nForgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for\nit. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor's auction.\nGot a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At\nPlevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it. Still\nhe had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was\nfarseeing.\nHis hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat\nand his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback\npictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.\nThe sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's\nhigh grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White\nslip of paper. Quite safe.\nOn the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.\nIn the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky\nwardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He\npulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf\ndropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut.

Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black\nconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in\nthat light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as\nhe walked in happy warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our\ndaily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.\nMakes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at\ndawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him.\nKeep it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a\nstrand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker\ntoo, old Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.\nWander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of\ncarpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking\na coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented\nwith fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two.\nWell, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among\nthe pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees,\nsignal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches\nme from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark\nlanguage. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet,\ncolour of Molly's new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of\nthose instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.\nProbably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track\nof the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself.\nWhat Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_\nleader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway\nbehind the bank of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch\nthat: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.\nHe approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up the\nflabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out\nwhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the\nend of the city traffic. For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as\nposition. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular\nfrom the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.\nBaldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an\nad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my\nbold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching\nthe aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him\noff to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I'm going to\ntell you? What's that, Mr O'Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,\nthey'd only be an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese.\nStop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor\nDignam, Mr O'Rourke.\nTurning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the\ndoorway:\n\u2014Good day, Mr O'Rourke.\n\u2014Good day to you.\n\u2014Lovely weather, sir.\n\u2014'Tis all that.\nWhere do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the\ncounty Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and\nbehold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think\nof the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin\nwithout passing a pub. Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put\ndown three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs\nand drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with\nthe town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we'll split the\njob, see?\nHow much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels\nof stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint\nJoseph's National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps\nmemory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee\ndoubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At\ntheir joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.\nHe halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages,\npolonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened\nin his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,\npacked with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the\nlukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood.\nA kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He\nstood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too,\ncalling the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a\npound and a half of Denny's sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous\nhips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New\nblood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on\nthe clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked\nskirt swings at each whack.\nThe ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with\nblotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.\nHe took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at\nKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter\nsanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round\nit, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:\nread it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page\nrustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the\nbeasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the\nbreeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a\npalm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled\nswitches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his\nsenses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt\nswinging, whack by whack by whack.\nThe porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime\nsausages and made a red grimace.\n\u2014Now, my miss, he said.\nShe tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.\n\u2014Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,\nplease?\nMr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went\nslowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the\nmorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood\noutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He\nsighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted\ntoenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The\nsting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For\nanother: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles' Lane. They like\nthem sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the\nwood.\n\u2014Threepence, please.\nHis hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.\nThen it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them\non the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,\ndisc by disc, into the till.\n\u2014Thank you, sir. Another time.\nA speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze\nafter an instant. No: better not: another time.\n\u2014Good morning, he said, moving away.\n\u2014Good morning, sir.\nNo sign. Gone. What matter?\nHe walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:\nplanters' company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish\ngovernment and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel\nand construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.\nYou pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with\nolives, oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need\nartificial irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your\nname entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten\ndown and the balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34,\nBerlin, W. 15.\nNothing doing. Still an idea behind it.\nHe looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered\nolivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in\njars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out.\nKnows the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.\nCitrons too. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin's parade. And\nMastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in\nCitron's basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand,\nlift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet,\nwild perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high\nprices too, Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant\nold times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain,\nGibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside\nat Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them\nbarefoot in soiled dungarees. There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do\nyou? Doesn't see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back\nis like that Norwegian captain's. Wonder if I'll meet him today.\nWatering cart. To provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.\nA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.",

Wait till I'm ready.\nHeaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the\nlanding.\nA paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as\nI'm.\nIn the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_. He folded it\nunder his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in\nsoft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.\nListening, he heard her voice:\n\u2014Come, come, pussy. Come.\nHe went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen\ntowards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.\nThe maid was in the garden. Fine morning.\nHe bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.\nMake a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to\nmanure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur.\nAll soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this\nthat is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top\ndressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are\nfed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid\ngloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in\nthat corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still\ngardens have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.\nHe walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the\npeg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don't remember that. Hallstand\ntoo full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters.\nDrago's shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown\nbrillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder\nhave I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox\nthere got away James Stephens, they say. O'Brien.\nDeep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.\nEnthusiast.\nHe kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to\nget these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head\nunder the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy\nlimewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he\npeered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his\ncountinghouse. Nobody.\nAsquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over\non his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a\nbit. Our prize titbit: _Matcham's Masterstroke_. Written by Mr Philip\nBeaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a\ncolumn has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds\nthree. Three pounds, thirteen and six.\nQuietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding\nbut resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding,\nhe allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading\nstill patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope\nit's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive.\nOne tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or\ntouch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now.\nSilly season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat\ncertainly. _Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won\nthe laughing witch who now_. Begins and ends morally. _Hand in hand_.\nSmart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his\nwater flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and\nreceived payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.\nMight manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for\nsome proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what\nshe said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving.\nBiting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her.\n9.15. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23.\nWhat possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I'm swelled after that\ncabbage. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.\nRubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning\nafter the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the\nhours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then\nnight hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head\ndancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.\nWhy? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use\nhumming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The\nmirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen\nvest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.\nIt wouldn't pan out somehow.\nEvening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with\ndaggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then\nblack. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.\nHe tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.\nThen he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled\nback the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom\ninto the air.\nIn the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully\nhis black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What\ntime is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.\nA creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George's\nchurch. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.\nHeigho! Heigho!",

Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.\nMr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to\nafter him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm\nthrough the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow\nat the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman\npeeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she\nwas passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad\nto see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.\nHuggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd\nwake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming\nmaking the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know\nwho will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the\nnails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same\nafter. Unclean job.\nAll waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am\nsitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better\nshift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.\nAll waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:\nthen horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and\nswaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of\nthe avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.\nAt walking pace.\nThey waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were\npassing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels\nrattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook\nrattling in the doorframes.\n\u2014What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.\n\u2014Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.\nMr Dedalus nodded, looking out.\n\u2014That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died\nout.\nAll watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by\npassers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the\nsmoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,\nclad in mourning, a wide hat.\n\u2014There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.\n\u2014Who is that?\n\u2014Your son and heir.\n\u2014Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.\nThe carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway\nbefore the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back\nto the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus\nfell back, saying:\n\u2014Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.\n\u2014Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding\nfaction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump\nof dung, the wise child that knows her own father.\nMr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the\nbottleworks: Dodder bridge.\nRichie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls\nthe firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing\nin Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the\nlandlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.\nBeginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife\nironing his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they\nare. About six hundred per cent profit.\n\u2014He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a\ncontaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks\nall over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll\nmake it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother\nor his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a\ngate. I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.\nHe cried above the clatter of the wheels:\n\u2014I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's\nson. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.\nHe ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild\nface and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy\nselfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If\nlittle Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.\nWalking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange\nfeeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that\nmorning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs\nat it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning\nup. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us\na touch, Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.\nGot big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.\nI could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent.\nLearn German too.\n\u2014Are we late? Mr Power asked.\n\u2014Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.\nMolly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping\nJupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a\nwoman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.\nLife, life.\nThe carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.\n\u2014Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.\n\u2014He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do\nyou follow me?\nHe closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away\ncrustcrumbs from under his thighs.\n\u2014What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?\n\u2014Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power\nsaid.\nAll raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless\nleather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward\nand said:\n\u2014Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?\n\u2014It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.\nMr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite\nclean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.\nMr Dedalus sighed resignedly.\n\u2014After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.\n\u2014Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of\nhis beard gently.\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.\n\u2014And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.\n\u2014At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.",

      "text": "\u2014I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.\nThe carriage halted short.\n\u2014What's wrong?\n\u2014We're stopped.\n\u2014Where are we?\nMr Bloom put his head out of the window.\n\u2014The grand canal, he said.\nGasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got\nit. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame\nreally. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed\ntea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss\nthis chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,\nLeopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.\nA dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's\ndogs usually are.\nA raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower\nspray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a\ncolander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.\n\u2014The weather is changing, he said quietly.\n\u2014A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.\n\u2014Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming\nout.\nMr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled\na mute curse at the sky.\n\u2014It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.\n\u2014We're off again.\nThe carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed\ngently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.\n\u2014Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking\nhim off to his face.\n\u2014O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear\nhim, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of _The Croppy Boy_.\n\u2014Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. _His singing of that simple\nballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the\nwhole course of my experience._\n\u2014Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the\nretrospective arrangement.\n\u2014Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.\n\u2014I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?\n\u2014In the paper this morning.\nMr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change\nfor her.\n\u2014No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.\nMr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the\ndeaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what\nPeake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton,\nUrbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.\nThanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief\nof his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind:\nQuinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.\nIt is now a month since dear Henry fled\nTo his home up above in the sky\nWhile his family weeps and mourns his loss\nHoping some day to meet him on high.\nI tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it\nin the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry\nfled. Before my patience are exhausted.\nNational school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.\nFull as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round\nwith a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their\nhats.\nA pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a\ntramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something\nautomatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow\nwould lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job\nmaking the new invention?\nAntient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a\ncrape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law\nperhaps.\nThey went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway\nbridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene\nStratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I\nwonder. I said I. Or the _Lily of Killarney_? Elster Grimes Opera\nCompany. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. _Fun on\nthe Bristol_. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have\nto stand a drink or two. As broad as it's long.\nHe's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.\nPlasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?\n\u2014How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in\nsalute.\n\u2014He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?\n\u2014Who? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\u2014Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.\nJust that moment I was thinking.\nMr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the\nwhite disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.\nMr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right\nhand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?\nFascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes\nfeel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am\njust looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body\ngetting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes\nthat? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh\nfalls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.\nHips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the\ncheeks behind.\nHe clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant\nglance over their faces.\nMr Power asked:\n\u2014How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?\n\u2014O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good\nidea, you see...\n\u2014Are you going yourself?\n\u2014Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the\ncounty Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the\nchief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.\n\u2014Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.\nHave you good artists?\n\u2014Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all\ntopnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in\nfact.\n\u2014And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.\nMr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and\nclasped them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.\nWoman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage\nwheeling by Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting\nknees.\nOot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his\nmouth opening: oot.\n\u2014Four bootlaces for a penny.\nWonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.\nSame house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.\nHas that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.\nTerrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.\nO'Callaghan on his last legs.\nAnd _Madame_. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing\nher hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_. No: _vorrei e non_. Looking\nat the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. _Mi trema un poco\nil_. Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A\nthrostle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.\nHis eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over\nthe ears. _Madame_: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.\nOnly politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the\nwoman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it\ntold me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played\nout pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her\na pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the\nMoira, was it?\nThey passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.\nMartin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.\n\u2014Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.\nA tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner\nof Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his\nspine.\n\u2014In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.\nMr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:\n\u2014The devil break the hasp of your back!\nMr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as\nthe carriage passed Gray's statue.\n\u2014We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.\nHis eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:\n\u2014Well, nearly all of us.\nMr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.\n\u2014That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and\nthe son.\n\u2014About the boatman? Mr Power asked.\n\u2014Yes. Isn't it awfully good?\n\u2014What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.\n\u2014There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to\nsend him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were\nboth.....\n\u2014What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried\nto drown.....\n\u2014Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!\nMr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....\nMartin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:\n\u2014Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on\ntheir way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got\nloose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.\n\u2014For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?\n\u2014Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished\nhim out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father\non the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....\n\u2014And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for\nsaving his son's life.\nA stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.\n\u2014O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.\n\u2014Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.\n\u2014One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.\nMr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.\nNelson's pillar.\n\u2014Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!\n\u2014We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.\nMr Dedalus sighed.\n\u2014Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh.\nMany a good one he told himself.\n\u2014The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his\nfingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last\nand he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this.\nHe's gone from us.\n\u2014As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went\nvery suddenly.\n\u2014Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.\nHe tapped his chest sadly.\nBlazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.\nDrink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent\ncolouring it.\nMr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.\n\u2014He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.\n\u2014The best death, Mr Bloom said.\nTheir wide open eyes looked at him.\n\u2014No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.\nNo-one spoke.\nDead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,\ntemperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college,\nGill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or\nwind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the\nlate Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.\nWhite horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,\ngalloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning\ncoach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for\na nun.\n\u2014Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.\nA dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's\nbody, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society\npays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant\nnothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If\nnot from the man. Better luck next time.\n\u2014Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.\nThe carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his\nbones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.\n\u2014In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.\n\u2014But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own\nlife.\nMartin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.\n\u2014The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.\n\u2014Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We\nmust take a charitable view of it.\n\u2014They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.\n\u2014It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.\nMr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's\nlarge eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.\nLike Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy\non that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to\ndrive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't\nbroken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the\nriverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of\na wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then\npawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the\nlife of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday\nmorning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have\nlooked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about\nthe place and capering with Martin's umbrella.\nAnd they call me the jewel of Asia,\nOf Asia,\nThe geisha.\nHe looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.\nThat afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The\nroom in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight\nthrough the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big\nand hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw\nlike yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the\nbed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son\nLeopold.\nNo more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.\nThe carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.\n\u2014We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.\n\u2014God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.\n\u2014I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow\nin Germany. The Gordon Bennett.\n\u2014Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.\nAs they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent\nover and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has\nanybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from _Saul._\nHe's as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The\n_Mater Misericordiae_. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place.\nWard for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the\ndying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They\nlook terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the\nspoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student\nthat was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the\nlying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other.\nThe carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.\n\u2014What's wrong now?\nA divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching\nby on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony\ncroups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their\nfear.\n\u2014Emigrants, Mr Power said.\n\u2014Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.\nHuuuh! out of that!\nThursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold\nthem about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for\nold England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter\nlost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a\nyear. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,\nsoap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off\nthe train at Clonsilla.\nThe carriage moved on through the drove.\n\u2014I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the\nparkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken\nin trucks down to the boats.\n\u2014Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite\nright. They ought to.\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have\nmunicipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line\nout to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage\nand all. Don't you see what I mean?\n\u2014O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon\ndiningroom.\n\u2014A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.\n\u2014Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent\nthan galloping two abreast?\n\u2014Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.\n\u2014And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when\nthe hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.\n\u2014That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell\nabout the road. Terrible!\n\u2014First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.\n\u2014Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.\nBom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy\nDignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too\nlarge for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up\nnow. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides\ndecompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also.\nWith wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.\n\u2014Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.\nDunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A\npause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up\nhere on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.\nElixir of life.\nBut suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in",

Still some might ooze out of an artery.\nIt would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.\nIn silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted\nby, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.\nCrossguns bridge: the royal canal.\nWater rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping\nbarge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a\nslacktethered horse. Aboard of the _Bugabu._\nTheir eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on\nhis raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of\nreeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,\nMoyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or\ncycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at\nthe auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby to\nrow me o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.\nCamping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without\nwriting. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by\nlock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his\nbrown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.\nThey drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.\n\u2014I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.\n\u2014Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.\n\u2014How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?\n\u2014Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.\nThe carriage steered left for Finglas road.\nThe stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of\nland silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,\nknelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:\nappealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder\nand sculptor.\nPassed.\nOn the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat,\ngrumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown\nyawning boot. After life's journey.\nGloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.\nMr Power pointed.\n\u2014That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.\n\u2014So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.\nMurdered his brother. Or so they said.\n\u2014The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.\n\u2014Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That's the maxim of the\nlaw. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent\nperson to be wrongfully condemned.\nThey looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,\ntenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully\ncondemned. Murder. The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered.\nThey love reading about it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing\nconsisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used.\nMurderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed.\nMurder will out.\nCramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without\nletting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with\ntheir pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.\nThe high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,\nrare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the\ntrees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain\ngestures on the air.\nThe felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put\nout his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with\nhis knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.\nChange that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly\nand transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.\nHe stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand\nstill held.\nPaltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same.\nPallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.\nBeyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and\nfruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.\nDogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.\nHe followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes\nwalking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took\nout the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.\nWhere is that child's funeral disappeared to?\nA team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,\ndragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a\ngranite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.\nCoffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at\nit with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck,\npressing on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out\nhere every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount\nJerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere\nevery minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.\nThousands every hour. Too many in the world.\nMourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,\nhard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt\nand tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to\ncry. Fish's face, bloodless and livid.\nThe mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So\nmuch dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First\nthe stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy\nfollowed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the\nbrother-in-law.\nAll walked after.\nMartin Cunningham whispered:\n\u2014I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.\n\u2014What? Mr Power whispered. How so?\n\u2014His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the\nQueen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.\nAnniversary.\n\u2014O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?\nHe glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed\ntowards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.\n\u2014Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.\n\u2014I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily\nmortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.\n\u2014How many children did he leave?\n\u2014Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.\n\u2014A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.\n\u2014A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.\n\u2014Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.\nHas the laugh at him now.\nHe looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had\noutlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must\noutlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the\nworld. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow\nhim. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who\nknows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on\na guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in\nthe end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of\nhearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the\nsubstance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,\nwaiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground:\nand lie no more in her warm bed.\n\u2014How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't\nseen you for a month of Sundays.\n\u2014Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?\n\u2014I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert\nsaid. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.\n\u2014And how is Dick, the solid man?\n\u2014Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.\n\u2014By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?\n\u2014Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,\npointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the\ninsurance is cleared up.\n\u2014Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?\n\u2014Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is\nbehind. He put down his name for a quid.\n\u2014I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought\nto mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.\n\u2014How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?\n\u2014Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.\nThey halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood\nbehind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and\nat the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was\nhe there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last\nmoment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe\nthree shillings to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the\ncoffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?\nAfter a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened\nlight. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow\ncandles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a\nwreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners\nknelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the\nfont and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper\nfrom his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black\nhat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.\nA server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a\ndoor. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with\none hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's\nbelly. Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.\nThey halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book\nwith a fluent croak.\nFather Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. _Dominenamine._ Bully\nabout the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe\nbetide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst\nsideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on\nhim like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:\nburst sideways.\n_\u2014Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._\nMakes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem\nmass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist.\nChilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning\nin the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a\ntoad too. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after\ncabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an\ninfernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they\nget like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the\nvaults of saint Werburgh's lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have\nto bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn\nit. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you're a goner.\nMy kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.\nThe priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's\nbucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end\nand shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As\nyou were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.\n_\u2014Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._\nThe server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be\nbetter to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course\n...\nHoly water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed\nup with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.\nWhat harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day\na fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in\nchildbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls\nwith little sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same\nthing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam\nnow.\n_\u2014In paradisum._\nSaid he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over\neverybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.\nThe priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny\nKelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the\ncoffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny\nKelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All\nfollowed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom",

Lord, I mustn't lilt here.\n\u2014The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.\nMr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.\n\u2014He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But\nhis heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here,\nSimon!\n\u2014Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'll soon be stretched\nbeside her.

Hope he'll say something else.\nMr Kernan added:\n\u2014The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more\nimpressive I must say.\nMr Bloom gave prudent assent.

Seat of the affections.\nBroken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood\nevery day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of\nthem lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn\nthe thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you\nare dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves.\nCome forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last\nday! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and\nthe rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning.\nPennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy\nmeasure.\nCorny Kelleher fell into step at their side.\n\u2014Everything went off A1, he said. What?\nHe looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With\nyour tooraloom tooraloom.\n\u2014As it should be, Mr Kernan said.\n\u2014What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.\nMr Kernan assured him.\n\u2014Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I\nknow his face.\nNed Lambert glanced back.\n\u2014Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the\nsoprano. She's his wife.\n\u2014O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some\ntime. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen\nseventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good\narmful she was.\nHe looked behind through the others.\n\u2014What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery\nline? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.\nNed Lambert smiled.\n\u2014Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.\n\u2014In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like\nthat for? She had plenty of game in her then.\n\u2014Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.\nJohn Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.\nThe barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the\ngrasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.\n\u2014John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.\nMr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:\n\u2014I am come to pay you another visit.\n\u2014My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want\nyour custom at all.\nSaluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin\nCunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.\n\u2014Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?\n\u2014I did not, Martin Cunningham said.\nThey bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The\ncaretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke\nin a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.\n\u2014They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy\nevening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for\nMulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After\ntraipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the\ndrunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was\nblinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.\nThe caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He\nresumed:\n\u2014And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like\nthe man_, says he. _That's not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.\nRewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,\naccepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as\nhe walked.\n\u2014That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.\n\u2014I know, Hynes said. I know that.\n\u2014To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure\ngoodheartedness: damn the thing else.\nMr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on\ngood terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort.\nKeys: like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout\nchecks. _Habeas corpus_. I must see about that ad after the funeral.\nDid I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she\ndisturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it's not chucked in the dead\nletter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's\nthe first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross.\nSilver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the\ngumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard.\nDangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death.\nShades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The\nshadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be\na descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy\nman great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o'\nthe wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at\nall. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to\nmake her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a\npitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they'd\nkiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards.\nLearn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here.\nMen like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In\nthe midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the\npoor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their\nvitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window.\nEight children he has anyway.\nHe has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field\nafter field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.\nSitting or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some\nday above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed\nthe ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim\ngrass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so\nit is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant\npoppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic\nGardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives\nnew life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.\nEvery man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,\ninvaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William\nWilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds\nthirteen and six. With thanks.\nI daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,\nnails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot\nquick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a\ntallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing\nout of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever\nthey are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically.\nNothing to feed on feed on themselves.\nBut they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply\nswirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little\nseaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of\npower seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at\nlife. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one\nabout the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11\np.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the\nmen anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's\nin fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep\nout the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.\nGravediggers in _Hamlet_. Shows the profound knowledge of the human\nheart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. _De mortuis\nnil nisi prius_. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral.\nSeems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live\nlonger. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.\n\u2014How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.\n\u2014Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.\nThe caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to\ntrundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,\nstepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin\nand set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.\nBurying him. We come to bury C\u00e6sar. His ides of March or June. He\ndoesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot\nover there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd\ngive a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never\ndreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he\ncould. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though\nhe could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too.\nFirst thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was\ntrue to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a\nThursday if you come to look at it.\nO, poor Robinson Crusoe!\nHow could you possibly do so?\nPoor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of\nthem all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could\ninvent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that\nway. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's.\nThey're so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the\nholy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one\ncoffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible\neven in the earth. The Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in\ncatacombs, mummies the same idea.\nMr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.\nTwelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.\nDeath's number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the\nchapel, that I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.\nNice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had\none like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he\nwas once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey\nsuit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's\nnot married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for\nhim.\nThe coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the\ngravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.\nPause.\nIf we were all suddenly somebody else.\nFar away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they\nsay. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.\nGentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The\nboy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in\nthe black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly\ncaretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which\nwill go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment\nyou feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake\nmust be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I\nhaven't yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering\naround you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and\nwandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His\nsleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose\npointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the\npillow away and finish it off on the floor since he's doomed. Devil in\nthat picture of sinner's death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace\nher in his shirt. Last act of _Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee_?\nBam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you.\nDon't forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even\nParnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one\nafter the other.\nWe are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and\nnot in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the\nfire of purgatory.\nDoes he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do\nwhen you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning.\nNear you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma,\npoor mamma, and little Rudy.\nThe gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in\non the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all\nthe time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of\ncourse. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some\nlaw to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a\ntelephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of\ndistress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well\nto get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no.\nThe clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.\nThe caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of\nit. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves\nwithout show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make\nits way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground,\nhe traversed the dismal fields.\nHynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he\nknows them all. No: coming to me.\n\u2014I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your\nchristian name? I'm not sure.\n\u2014L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He\nasked me to.\n\u2014Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the _Freeman_ once.\nSo he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good\nidea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He\ndied of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.\nCharley, you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does\nno harm. I saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave\nhim under an obligation: costs nothing.\n\u2014And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was\nover there in the...\nHe looked around.\n\u2014Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?\n\u2014M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his\nname?\nHe moved away, looking about him.\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!\nDidn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all\nthe. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good\nLord, what became of him?\nA seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.\n\u2014O, excuse me!\nHe stepped aside nimbly.\nClay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.\nA mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested\ntheir spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped\nhis wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The\ngravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards\nthe barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One\nbent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his\nmates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.\nSilently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.\nThe brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.\nThanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For\nyourselves just.\nThe mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying\nat whiles to read a name on a tomb.\n\u2014Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.\n\u2014Let us, Mr Power said.\nThey turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr\nPower's blank voice spoke:\n\u2014Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled\nwith stones. That one day he will come again.\nHynes shook his head.\n\u2014Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was\nmortal of him. Peace to his ashes.\nMr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,\nbroken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,\nold Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on\nsome charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does\nanybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a\ncoalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls' day.\nTwentyseventh I'll be at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He\nkeeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his\nshears clipping. Near death's door. Who passed away. Who departed this\nlife. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of\nthem. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what\nthey were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid\nfive shillings in the pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked\ngood Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that\npoem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest\nthe protestants put it. Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him\nhome. Well it's God's acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly\nplastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the\n_Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths\nhung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money.\nStill, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome,\nnever withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.\nA bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the\nwedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.\nKnows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even\nsadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen\nmatchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.\nThe Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be\nsideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was\ndedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this\ninfliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket\nof fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the\nboy. Apollo that was.\nHow many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed.\nAs you are now so once were we.\nBesides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the\nvoice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in\nthe house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.\nKraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain\nhellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph\nreminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after\nfifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that\ndied when I was in Wisdom Hely's.\nRtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!\nHe looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he\ngoes.\nAn obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the\npebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey\nalive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.\nGood hidingplace for treasure.\nWho lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was\nburied here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.\nTail gone now.\nOne of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones\nclean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat\ngone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that\n_Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a\ncorpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the\nother firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the\nplague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to\nashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by\nbirds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See\nyour whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can't\nbury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news\ngo about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication.\nWe learned that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed\nfor them. Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They\nwouldn't care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of\ncorpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.\nThe gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.\nEnough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I\nwas here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.\nAnd even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I\nread of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running\ngravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after\ndeath. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after\ndeath. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like\nthat other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and\nfeel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their\nmaggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds:\nwarm fullblooded life.\nMartin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.\nSolicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,\ncommissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.\nMat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl,\ncigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got\nhis rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside\nhim. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to\nme. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the\nlilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are\nby.\nGot a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.\n\u2014Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.\nThey stopped.\n\u2014Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.\nJohn Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.\n\u2014There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.\nJohn Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed\nthe nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head\nagain.\n\u2014It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.\nJohn Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.\n\u2014Thank you, he said shortly.\nThey walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a\nfew paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin\ncould wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his\nseeing it.\nOyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.\nGet the pull over him that way.\nThank you. How grand we are this morning!",

Neck.\nA telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and\nstepped off posthaste with a word:\n_\u2014Freeman!_\nMr Bloom said slowly:\n\u2014Well, he is one of our saviours also.\nA meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed\nin through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along\nthe now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation?\nThumping. Thumping.\nHe pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn\npacking paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards\nNannetti's reading closet.\nWITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST\nRESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS\nHynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump. This\nmorning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a\nman to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His\nmachineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand:\nfermenting. Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing\nto get in.\nHOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT\nMr Bloom halted behind the foreman's spare body, admiring a glossy\ncrown.\nStrange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for\nCollege green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was\nworth. It's the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news\nin the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in\nthe year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of\nRosenallis, barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule\npursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets\nexported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake's weekly Pat\nand Bull story. Uncle Toby's page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin's\nqueries. Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence? I'd like\nthat part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note. M. A. P.\nMainly all pictures. Shapely bathers on golden strand. World's biggest\nballoon. Double marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms\nlaughing heartily at each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than\nthe Irish.\nThe machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he\ngot paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they'd clank on\nand on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle\nthe whole thing. Want a cool head.\n\u2014Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.\nSoon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.\nThe foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the\nsheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently\nover the dirty glass screen.\n\u2014Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.\nMr Bloom stood in his way.\n\u2014If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,\npointing backward with his thumb.\n\u2014Did you? Hynes asked.\n\u2014Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you'll catch him.\n\u2014Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I'll tap him too.\nHe hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman's Journal_.\nThree bob I lent him in Meagher's. Three weeks. Third hint.\nWE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK\nMr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti's desk.\n\u2014Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?\nMr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.\n\u2014He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.\nThe foreman moved his pencil towards it.\n\u2014But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants\ntwo keys at the top.\nHell of a racket they make. He doesn't hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.\nMaybe he understands what I.\nThe foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began\nto scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.\n\u2014Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.\nLet him take that in first.\nMr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the\nforeman's sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the\nobedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles\nof it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels:\nvarious uses, thousand and one things.\nSlipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew\nswiftly on the scarred woodwork.\nHOUSE OF KEY(E)S\n\u2014Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.\nAlexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.\nBetter not teach him his own business.\n\u2014You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top\nin leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that's a good idea?\nThe foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched\nthere quietly.\n\u2014The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,\nthe Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from\nthe isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?\nI could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then\nif he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.\n\u2014We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?\n\u2014I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a\nhouse there too. I'll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that\nand just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass\nlicensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.\nThe foreman thought for an instant.\n\u2014We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months' renewal.\nA typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it\nsilently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks,",

An\ninstant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh's\nunshaven blackspectacled face.\n\u2014Doughy Daw! he cried.\nWHAT WETHERUP SAID\nAll very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot\ncake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn't he? Why they\ncall him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged\nto that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that\nnicely. Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said\nthat. Get a grip of them by the stomach.\nThe inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested\nby a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared\nabout them and the harsh voice asked:\n\u2014What is it?\n\u2014And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said\ngrandly.\n\u2014Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.\n\u2014Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink\nafter that.\n\u2014Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.\n\u2014Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.\nNed Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor's blue eyes roved\ntowards Mr Bloom's face, shadowed by a smile.\n\u2014Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.\nMEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED\n\u2014North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We\nwon every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!\n\u2014Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at\nhis toecaps.\n\u2014In Ohio! the editor shouted.\n\u2014So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.\nPassing out he whispered to J. J. O'Molloy:\n\u2014Incipient jigs. Sad case.\n\u2014Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.\nMy Ohio!\n\u2014A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.\nO, HARP EOLIAN!\nHe took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking\noff a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant\nunwashed teeth.\n\u2014Bingbang, bangbang.\nMr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.\n\u2014Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.\nHe went in.\n\u2014What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming\nto the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.\n\u2014That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.

What was he doing in Irishtown?\n\u2014Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I\nsuppose it's worth a short par. He'd give the ad, I think. I'll tell\nhim...\nK.M.R.I.A.\n\u2014He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his\nshoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.\nWhile Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on\njerkily.\nRAISING THE WIND\n\u2014_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I'm up to\nhere. I've been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to\nback a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take\nthe will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the\nwind anyhow.\nJ. J. O'Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught\nup on the others and walked abreast.\n\u2014When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty\nfingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the\nrailings.\n\u2014Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old\nDublin women on the top of Nelson's pillar.\nSOME COLUMN!\u2014THAT'S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID\n\u2014That's new, Myles Crawford said. That's copy. Out for the waxies'\nDargle. Two old trickies, what?\n\u2014But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see\nthe roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines'\nblue dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's. But it makes them\ngiddy to look so they pull up their skirts...\nTHOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES\n\u2014Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We're in the\narchdiocese here.\n\u2014And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue\nof the onehandled adulterer.\n\u2014Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the\nidea. I see what you mean.\nDAMES DONATE DUBLIN'S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF\n\u2014It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too\ntired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between\nthem and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with\ntheir handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and\nspitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.\nHe gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O'Madden\nBurke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney's.\n\u2014Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.\nSOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH\nMOLARS. ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.\n\u2014You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of\nGorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were\nbitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble\nand a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of\nbeauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.\nPoor Penelope. Penelope Rich.\nThey made ready to cross O'Connell street.\nHELLO THERE, CENTRAL!\nAt various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless\ntrolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,\nRathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green,\nRingsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper\nRathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs,\ndelivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water\nfloats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn,\nrapidly.\nWHAT?\u2014AND LIKEWISE\u2014WHERE?\n\u2014But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get the\nplums?\nVIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.\n\u2014Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to\nreflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: _deus nobis h\u00e6c otia fecit._\n\u2014No, Stephen said. I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The\nParable of The Plums._\n\u2014I see, the professor said.\nHe laughed richly.\n\u2014I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land.\nWe gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O'Molloy.\nHORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY\nJ. J. O'Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held\nhis peace.\n\u2014I see, the professor said.\nHe halted on sir John Gray's pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson\nthrough the meshes of his wry smile.\nDIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE\nWIMBLES, FLO WANGLES\u2014YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM?\n\u2014Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must\nsay.\n\u2014Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty's\ntruth was known.",

Dead\ndrunk on the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians.\nImagine drinking that! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the\nthings.\nLooking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt\nquaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben\nJ's son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and\neightpence too much. Hhhhm. It's the droll way he comes out with the\nthings. Knows how to tell a story too.\nThey wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.\nHe threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet\nper sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of\nswells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the\nday I threw that stale cake out of the Erin's King picked it up in the\nwake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.\nThe hungry famished gull\nFlaps o'er the waters dull.\nThat is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has\nno rhymes: blank verse.

They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they\nhave, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down\nhere sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder\nwhat kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.\nThey wheeled flapping weakly. I'm not going to throw any more. Penny\nquite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and\nmouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes\nlike that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are\nnot salty?

In a photographer's there. Getting on like a house on fire. How\nare all your charges?\n\u2014All on the baker's list, Mrs Breen said.\nHow many has she? No other in sight.\n\u2014You're in black, I see. You have no...\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.\nGoing to crop up all day, I foresee. Who's dead, when and what did he\ndie of? Turn up like a bad penny.\n\u2014O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn't any near relation.\nMay as well get her sympathy.\n\u2014Dignam, Mr Bloom said.

Funeral was this morning.\nYour funeral's tomorrow\nWhile you're coming through the rye.\nDiddlediddle dumdum\nDiddlediddle...\n\u2014Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen's womaneyes said melancholily.\nNow that's quite enough about that.

He's in\nthere now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me\nheartscalded. Wait till I show you.\nHot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured\nout from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom's\ngullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,\nor they'd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab\nstood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of\nhunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork\nchained to the table.\nOpening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on\nthose things. Stick it in a chap's eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open.\nMoney. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain.\nHusband barging. Where's the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are\nyou feeding your little brother's family? Soiled handkerchief:\nmedicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...\n\u2014There must be a new moon out, she said. He's always bad then. Do you\nknow what he did last night?\nHer hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in\nalarm, yet smiling.\n\u2014What? Mr Bloom asked.\nLet her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.\n\u2014Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.\nIndiges.\n\u2014Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.\n\u2014The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.\nShe took a folded postcard from her handbag.\n\u2014Read that, she said. He got it this morning.\n\u2014What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U. P.?\n\u2014U. p: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It's a great\nshame for them whoever he is.\n\u2014Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.\nShe took back the card, sighing.\n\u2014And now he's going round to Mr Menton's office. He's going to take an\naction for ten thousand pounds, he says.\nShe folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.\nSame blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen\nits best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three\nold grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a\ntasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than\nMolly.\nSee the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.\nHe looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.\nPungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I'm hungry too. Flakes of\npastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her\ncheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie\nPowell that was. In Luke Doyle's long ago. Dolphin's Barn, the\ncharades. U. p: up.\nChange the subject.\n\u2014Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.\n\u2014Mina Purefoy? she said.\nPhilip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers' Club. Matcham often thinks of\nthe masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.\n\u2014Yes.\n\u2014I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She's in the\nlying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She's three\ndays bad now.\n\u2014O, Mr Bloom said. I'm sorry to hear that.\n\u2014Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It's a very stiff\nbirth, the nurse told me.\n\u2014O, Mr Bloom said.\nHis heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in\ncompassion. Dth! Dth!\n\u2014I'm sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That's\nterrible for her.\nMrs Breen nodded.\n\u2014She was taken bad on the Tuesday...\nMr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:\n\u2014Mind! Let this man pass.\nA bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a\nrapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a\nskullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat,\na stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.\n\u2014Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts.\nWatch!\n\u2014Who is he if it's a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?\n\u2014His name is Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr\nBloom said smiling. Watch!\n\u2014He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these\ndays.\nShe broke off suddenly.\n\u2014There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to\nMolly, won't you?",

      "text": "and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.\nWhat will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?\n\u2014Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.\n\u2014Hello, Flynn.\n\u2014How's things?\n\u2014Tiptop... Let me see. I'll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.\nSardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham\nand his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is\nhome without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad!\nUnder the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam's\npotted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too\nsalty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of\nhonour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch\nthe effect. _There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something\nthe somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger_. With it an abode of\nbliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked\nand minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together.\nHygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of\ninside. Peace and war depend on some fellow's digestion. Religions.\nChristmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be\nmerry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all\nbut itself. Mity cheese.\n\u2014Have you a cheese sandwich?\n\u2014Yes, sir.\nLike a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of\nburgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,\nTom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served\nme that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God\nmade food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.\n\u2014Wife well?\n\u2014Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?\n\u2014Yes, sir.\nNosey Flynn sipped his grog.\n\u2014Doing any singing those times?\nLook at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.\nMusic. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him.\nDoes no harm. Free ad.\n\u2014She's engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard\nperhaps.\n\u2014No. O, that's the style. Who's getting it up?\nThe curate served.\n\u2014How much is that?\n\u2014Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.\nMr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. _Mr MacTrigger_. Easier\nthan the dreamy creamy stuff. _His five hundred wives. Had the time of\ntheir lives._\n\u2014Mustard, sir?\n\u2014Thank you.\nHe studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. _Their lives_. I have\nit. _It grew bigger and bigger and bigger_.\n\u2014Getting it up? he said. Well, it's like a company idea, you see. Part\nshares and part profits.\n\u2014Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket\nto scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn't Blazes Boylan\nmixed up in it?\nA warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom's heart. He\nraised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock\nfive minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.\nHis midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,\nlongingly.\nWine.\nHe smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to\nspeed it, set his wineglass delicately down.\n\u2014Yes, he said. He's the organiser in point of fact.\nNo fear: no brains.\nNosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.\n\u2014He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that\nboxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello\nbarracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he\nwas telling me...\nHope that dewdrop doesn't come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.\n\u2014For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God\ntill further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is\na hairy chap.\nDavy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,\ncleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose\nsmile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat\non the parsnips.\n\u2014And here's himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give\nus a good one for the Gold cup?\n\u2014I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a\nhorse.\n\u2014You're right there, Nosey Flynn said.\nMr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of\ndisgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his\nwine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather\nwith the chill off.\nNice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like\nthe way it curves there.\n\u2014I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined\nmany a man, the same horses.\nVintners' sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits\nfor consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.\n\u2014True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's no\nstraight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He's giving\nSceptre today. Zinfandel's the favourite, Lord Howard de Walden's, won\nat Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one\nagainst Saint Amant a fortnight before.\n\u2014That so? Davy Byrne said...\nHe went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned\nits pages.\n\u2014I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of\nhorseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,\nRothschild's filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow\ncap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off\nit. Ay.\nHe drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the\nflutes.\n\u2014Ay, he said, sighing.\nMr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull.\nWill I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him\nforget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down\nagain. Cold nose he'd have kissing a woman. Still they might like.\nPrickly beards they like. Dogs' cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the\nrumbling stomach's Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling\nhim in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!\nWine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish\ncheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I'm not thirsty. Bath\nof course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o'clock I can.\nSix. Six. Time will be gone then. She...\nMild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off\ncolour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy\nlobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of\nshells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the\nFrench eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn\nnothing in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything\ninto your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you\nthink good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so\non. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting\nfruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need\nartificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters.\nUnsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too.\nWho found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank\noysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this\nmorning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed\nno June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high.\nTainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs\nfifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each\ndish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That\narchduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs?\nOr who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch\nin town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the\nfashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half\nthe catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price.\nCheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses.\nSwell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The _\u00e9lite. Cr\u00e8me de\nla cr\u00e8me_. They want special dishes to pretend they're. Hermit with a\nplatter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat\nwith me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to\nvenisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow.\nSpread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted\n_chef_ like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage _\u00e0 la duchesse de\nParme_. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know\nwhat you've eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself.\nDosing it with Edwards' desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them.\nLobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn't mind being a\nwaiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I\ntempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do\nbedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat\nlived in Killiney, I remember. _Du de la_ is French. Still it's the\nsame fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out\nof making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills can't write his\nname on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth\ntwisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth\nfifty thousand pounds.\nStuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.\nGlowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the\nwinepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch\ntelling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under\nwild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The\nbay purple by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards\nSutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried\ncities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather\nscrub my hand under her nape, you'll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft\nwith ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not\nturn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her\nmouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and\nchewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.\nJoy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft\nwarm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing\neyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth\nrhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants.\nScreened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her,\nkissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts\nfull in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued\nher. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair.\nKissed, she kissed me.\nMe. And me now.\nStuck, the flies buzzed.\nHis downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.\nBeauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno:\ncurves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the\nround hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don't care what\nman looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like\nFlynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?\nMortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods\ngolden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled\nmutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it\ndrinking electricity: gods' food. Lovely forms of women sculped\nJunonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out\nbehind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like\nstoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I'll look today. Keeper\nwon't see. Bend down let something fall see if she.\nDribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do\nthere to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and\nwalked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men\nlovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.\nWhen the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:\n\u2014What is this he is? Isn't he in the insurance line?\n\u2014He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for\nthe _Freeman._\n\u2014I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?\n\u2014Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?\n\u2014I noticed he was in mourning.\n\u2014Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at\nhome. You're right, by God. So he was.\n\u2014I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a\ngentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their\nminds.\n\u2014It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before\nyesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's\nwife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home\nto his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.\n\u2014And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.\nNosey Flynn pursed his lips.\n\u2014He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of\nthat.\n\u2014How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.\nNosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He\nwinked.\n\u2014He's in the craft, he said.\n\u2014Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.\n\u2014Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He's\nan excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg\nup. I was told that by a\u2014well, I won't say who.\n\u2014Is that a fact?\n\u2014O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you're\ndown. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they're as close\nas damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.\nDavy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:\n\u2014Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!\n\u2014There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find\nout what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and\nswore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint\nLegers of Doneraile.\nDavy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:\n\u2014And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here\nand I never once saw him\u2014you know, over the line.\n\u2014God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips\noff when the fun gets too hot. Didn't you see him look at his watch?\nAh, you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he\ndoes he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to\nGod he does.\n\u2014There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He's a safe man, I'd say.\n\u2014He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He's been known\nto put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O,\nBloom has his good points. But there's one thing he'll never do.\nHis hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.\n\u2014I know, Davy Byrne said.\n\u2014Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.\nPaddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning,\na plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.\n\u2014Day, Mr Byrne.\n\u2014Day, gentlemen.\nThey paused at the counter.\n\u2014Who's standing? Paddy Leonard asked.\n\u2014I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.\n\u2014Well, what'll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.\n\u2014I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.\n\u2014How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God' sake? What's\nyours, Tom?\n\u2014How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.\nFor answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and\nhiccupped.\n\u2014Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.\n\u2014Certainly, sir.\nPaddy Leonard eyed his alemates.\n\u2014Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I'm standing drinks to! Cold\nwater and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.\nHe has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.\n\u2014Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.\nTom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set\nbefore him.\n\u2014That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.\n\u2014Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.\nTom Rochford nodded and drank.\n\u2014Is it Zinfandel?\n\u2014Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I'm going to plunge five bob on my\nown.\n\u2014Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard\nsaid. Who gave it to you?\nMr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.\n\u2014So long! Nosey Flynn said.\nThe others turned.\n\u2014That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.\n\u2014Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two\nof your small Jamesons after that and a...\n\u2014Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.\n\u2014Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.\nMr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth\nsmooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with\nthose R\u00f6ntgen rays searchlight you could.\nAt Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the\ncobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks\nhaving fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom\ncoasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they\nmove. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of\nhis? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. Lean people long\nmouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and\ninvent free. Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering.\nHe hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:\nDon Giovanni, a cenar teco\nM'invitasti.\nFeel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap\nin the blues. Dutch courage. That _Kilkenny People_ in the national\nlibrary now I must.\nBare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller,\nplumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way\ndown, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour\nround the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric\njuice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to\nstand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.\n\u2014_A cenar teco._\nWhat does that _teco_ mean? Tonight perhaps.\nDon Giovanni, thou hast me invited\nTo come to supper tonight,\nThe rum the rumdum.\nDoesn't go properly.\nKeyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That'll be two pounds ten about\ntwo pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott's dyeworks\nvan over there. If I get Billy Prescott's ad: two fifteen. Five guineas\nabout. On the pig's back.\nCould buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new\ngarters.\nToday. Today. Not think.\nTour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,\nMargate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely\nseaside girls. Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy\nthought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages.\nWill eat anything.\nMr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and\npassed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. _Why I left the\nchurch of Rome? Birds' Nest._ Women run him. They say they used to give\npauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato\nblight. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor\njews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.\nA blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No\ntram in sight. Wants to cross.\n\u2014Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.\nThe blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He\nmoved his head uncertainly.\n\u2014You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.\nDo you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.\nThe cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its\nline and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I\nsaw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in\nJohn Long's. Slaking his drouth.\n\u2014There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see you\nacross. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?\n\u2014Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.\n\u2014Come, Mr Bloom said.\nHe touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to\nguide it forward.\nSay something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust\nwhat you tell them. Pass a common remark.\n\u2014The rain kept off.\nNo answer.\nStains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different\nfor him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like\nMilly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if\nhe has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired\ndrudge get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a\nhorse.\n\u2014Thanks, sir.\nKnows I'm a man. Voice.\n\u2014Right now? First turn to the left.\nThe blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing\nhis cane back, feeling again.\nMr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone\ntweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?\nMust have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense\nof volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.\nWonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer\nidea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could\nhe walk in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face like\na fellow going in to be a priest.\nPenrose! That was that chap's name.\nLook at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.\nTune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a\ndeformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might\nsay. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets.\nPeople ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday.\nHates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.\nSense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched\ntogether. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the\nspring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with\nyour eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say\nget no pleasure.\nAnd with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl\npassing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have\nthem all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his\nmind's eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his\nfingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,\nfor instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.\nThen passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of\nwhite.\nPostoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two\nshillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just\nhere too. Wait. Think over it.\nWith a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above\nhis ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt\nthe skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.\nThe belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick\nstreet. Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling\nmy braces.\nWalking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat\nand trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of\nhis belly. But I know it's whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to\nsee.\nHe withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.\nPoor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would\nhe have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being\nborn that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned\nand drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration\nfor sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.\nDear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can't cotton on to\nthem someway.\nSir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons' hall. Solemn as Troy.\nAfter his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a\nmagnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat\nschool. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he'd turn up his nose\nat that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a\ndusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder's court.\nWellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their\npercentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil\non moneylenders. Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling. Now he's really\nwhat they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers\nin wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your\nsoul.\nHello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant.\nSixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer's hospital. _The\nMessiah_ was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out\nthere: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a\nleech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.\nMr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.\nStraw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.\nHis heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved\nto the right.\nIs it? Almost certain. Won't look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too\nheady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.\nMaking for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.\nHandsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?\nDidn't see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.\nThe flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold\nstatues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.\nNo. Didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate.\nMy heart!\nHis eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir\nThomas Deane was the Greek architecture.\nLook for something I.\nHis hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded\nAgendath Netaim. Where did I?\nBusy looking.\nHe thrust back quick Agendath.\nAfternoon she said.\nI am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. _Freeman._\nWhere did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?\nHurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.\nHis hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap\nlotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.\nSafe!",

Still: but an itch of\ndeath is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak\ntheir will.\n\u2014Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most\nenigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so\nmuch. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.\n\u2014But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn't it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind\nof private paper, don't you know, of his private life. I mean, I don't\ncare a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty...\nHe rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his\ndefiance. His private papers in the original. _Ta an bad ar an tir.\nTaim in mo shagart_. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.\nQuoth littlejohn Eglinton:\n\u2014I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I\nmay as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that\nShakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.\nBear with me.\nStephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under\nwrinkled brows. A basilisk. _E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca_. Messer\nBrunetto, I thank thee for the word.\n\u2014As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,\nfrom day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the\nartist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast\nis where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of\nnew stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father\nthe image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of\nimagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which\nI was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to\nbe. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit\nhere now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.\nDrummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.\n\u2014Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness\nmight be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from\nthe son.\nHas the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.\n\u2014That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.\nJohn Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.\n\u2014If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug\nin the market. The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan\nadmired so much breathe another spirit.\n\u2014The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.\n\u2014There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a\nsundering.\nSaid that.",

And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr\nGeorge Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles\non Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant. Oddly\nenough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of\nthe sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I\nown that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more\nin harmony with\u2014what shall I say?\u2014our notions of what ought not to have\nbeen.\nFelicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg,\nprize of their fray.\nHe thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost\nlove thy man?\n\u2014That may be too, Stephen said. There's a saying of Goethe's which Mr\nMagee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you\nwill get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a\n_buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a\nscandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord\nof language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had\nwritten _Romeo and Juliet_. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely\nkilled. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say)\nand he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play\nvictoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will\nnot save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of\nthe boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew\nis worsted yet there remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is,\nI feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new\npassion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own\nunderstanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages\ncommingle in a whirlpool.\nThey list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.\n\u2014The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the\nporch of a sleeping ear.

A most instructive discussion.\nMr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of\nShakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.\nHe smiled on all sides equally.\nBuck Mulligan thought, puzzled:\n\u2014Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.\nA flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.\n\u2014To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like\nSynge.\nMr Best turned to him.\n\u2014Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He'll see you after at\nthe D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's _Lovesongs of Connacht_.\n\u2014I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?\n\u2014The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired\nperhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress\nplayed Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.\nVining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be\nan Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He\nswears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.\n\u2014The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said,\nlifting his brilliant notebook. That _Portrait of Mr W. H._ where he\nproves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all\nhues.\n\u2014For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.\nOr Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?\n\u2014I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of\ncourse it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the\ncolour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. It's the very\nessence of Wilde, don't you know. The light touch.\nHis glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.\nTame essence of Wilde.\nYou're darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan\nDeasy's ducats.\nHow much did I spend? O, a few shillings.\nFor a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.\nWit. You would give your five wits for youth's proud livery he pranks\nin. Lineaments of gratified desire.\nThere be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool\nruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.\nEve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in's kiss.\n\u2014Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking.\nThe mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\nThey talked seriously of mocker's seriousness.\nBuck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head\nwagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His\nmobile lips read, smiling with new delight.\n\u2014Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!\nHe sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:\n\u2014_The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the\nimmense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus. Where did you\nlaunch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four\nquid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram!\nMalachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer!\nO, you priestified Kinchite!\nJoyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a\nquerulous brogue:\n\u2014It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were,\nHaines and myself, the time himself brought it in. 'Twas murmur we did\nfor a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with\nleching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's\nsitting civil waiting for pints apiece.\nHe wailed:\n\u2014And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your\nconglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the\ndrouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.\nStephen laughed.\nQuickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.\n\u2014The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard\nyou pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He's out in pampooties to\nmurder you.\n\u2014Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.\nBuck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping\nceiling.\n\u2014Murder you! he laughed.\nHarsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of\nlights in rue Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Arts. In words of words for words,\npalabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods,\nbrandishing a winebottle. _C'est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish. His\nimage, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i'the forest.\n\u2014Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.\n\u2014... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his\n_Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms... Yes?\nWhat is it?\n\u2014There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and\noffering a card. From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the\n_Kilkenny People_ for last year.\n\u2014Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...\nHe took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,\nasked, creaked, asked:\n\u2014Is he?... O, there!\nBrisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked\nwith voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most\nhonest broadbrim.\n\u2014This gentleman? _Freeman's Journal? Kilkenny People?_ To be sure. Good\nday, sir. _Kilkenny_... We have certainly...\nA patient silhouette waited, listening.\n\u2014All the leading provincial... _Northern Whig, Cork Examiner,\nEnniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this\ngentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me...\nThis way... Please, sir...\nVoluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing\ndark figure following his hasty heels.\nThe door closed.\n\u2014The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.\nHe jumped up and snatched the card.\n\u2014What's his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.\nHe rattled on:\n\u2014Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the\nmuseum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth\nthat has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to\nher. _Life of life, thy lips enkindle._\nSuddenly he turned to Stephen:\n\u2014He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker\nthan the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.\nVenus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the\nmaiden hid_.\n\u2014We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval.\nWe begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if\nat all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.\n\u2014Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty\nfrom Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy\nin whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty\nyears he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a\nsalary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was\nrich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called\nit, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack,\nhoneysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons,\nringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a\nmillion francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The\ngombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of\nSheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its\nchaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know\nManningham's story of the burgher's wife who bade Dick Burbage to her\nbed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare,\noverhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns\nand, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon's\nblankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_. And the gay\nlakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady\nPenelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the\npunks of the bankside, a penny a time.\nCours la Reine. _Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites\ncochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?_\n\u2014The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford's\nmother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.\nBuck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:\n\u2014Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!\n\u2014And Harry of six wives' daughter. And other lady friends from\nneighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those\ntwenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing\nbehind the diamond panes?\nDo and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,\nhe walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of\nJuno's eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.\nAfar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.\nBuck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply.\n\u2014Whom do you suspect? he challenged.\n\u2014Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice\nspurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.\nLove that dare not speak its name.\n\u2014As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a\nlord.\nOld wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.\n\u2014It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all\nother and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for\nthe stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he\nhad a shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a\nbedvow. Two deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the\ndullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's\nbrother. Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer,\ntwice a wooer.\nStephen turned boldly in his chair.\n\u2014The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you\ndeny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy\ntell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years\nbetween the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those\nwomen saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her\npoor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the\nfirst to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her\nsons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use\ngranddaddy's words, wed her second, having killed her first.\nO, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in\nroyal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her\nfather's shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein\nhe has commended her to posterity.\nHe faced their silence.\nTo whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.\nBut that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.\nShe was entitled to her widow's dower\nAt common law. His legal knowledge was great\nOur judges tell us.\nHim Satan fleers,\nMocker:\nAnd therefore he left out her name\nFrom the first draft but he did not leave out\nThe presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,\nFor his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford\nAnd in London. And therefore when he was urged,\nAs I believe, to name her\nHe left her his\nSecondbest\nBed.\n_Punkt._\nLeftherhis\nSecondbest\nLeftherhis\nBestabed\nSecabest\nLeftabed.\nWoa!\n\u2014Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as\nthey have still if our peasant plays are true to type.\n\u2014He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and\nlanded estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist\nshareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her\nhis best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in\npeace?\n\u2014It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr\nSecondbest Best said finely.\n\u2014_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was\nsmiled on.\n\u2014Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.\nLet me think.\n\u2014Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,\nStephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays\ntribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his\ndead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget\nNell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.\n\u2014Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...\n\u2014He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for\na king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!\n\u2014What? asked Besteglinton.\nWilliam Shakespeare and company, limited. The people's William. For\nterms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...\n\u2014Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought\nof the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his\nhands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those\ndays._ Lovely!\nCatamite.\n\u2014The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to\nugling Eglinton.\nSteadfast John replied severe:\n\u2014The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake\nand have it.\nSayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?\n\u2014And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his\nown long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself\na cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the\nfamine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship\nmentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.\nHe sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted\nhis pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could\nAubrey's ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to\nhis mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging\nand quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart being\nplucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_\nwith the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn\nfor witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in _Love's Labour Lost_.\nHis pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking\nenthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter's\ntheory of equivocation. The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and\nthe play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American\ncousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney's. As for fay Elizabeth,\notherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives\nof Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for\ndeephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.\nI think you're getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of\ntheolologicophilolological. _Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._\n\u2014Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly. Your dean\nof studies holds he was a holy Roman.\n_Sufflaminandus sum._\n\u2014He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French\npolisher of Italian scandals.\n\u2014A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him\nmyriadminded.\n_Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit\namicitia inter multos._\n\u2014Saint Thomas, Stephen began...\n\u2014_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.\nThere he keened a wailing rune.\n\u2014_Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!_ It's destroyed we are from this day!\nIt's destroyed we are surely!\nAll smiled their smiles.\n\u2014Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy\nreading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different\nfrom that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in\nhis wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that\nthe love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some\nstranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with\navarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations\nare made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the\njews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their\naffections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues\nold Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so\ntightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will\nhold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls\nhis wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his\nmanservant or his maidservant or his jackass.\n\u2014Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.\n\u2014Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.\n\u2014Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.\n\u2014The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's\nwidow, is the will to die.\n_\u2014Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.\nWhat of all the will to do?\nIt has vanished long ago...\n\u2014She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the\nmobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as\nrare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of\nseven parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed\nwith her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid\nfor but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a\nsoul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the\n_Merry Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she\nthought over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches_ and _The most\nSpiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_. Venus has\ntwisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.\nIt is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.\n\u2014History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_. The\nages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's\nworst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that\nRussell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say\nthat only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family\nman. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.\nLean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping\nwith the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it\nhim. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there's a\ngentleman to see you. Me? Says he's your father, sir. Give me my\nWordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in\nstrossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with\nclauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.\nYour own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.\nHurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I\ntouched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is\nattending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.\n\u2014A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary\nevil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death.\nIf you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters,\nwith thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_,\nwith fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from\nWittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the\nlustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the\nnight. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of\nfatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.\nBoccaccio's Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with\nchild. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to\nman. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only\nbegetter to only begotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna which\nthe cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is\nfounded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro\nand microcosm, upon the void.

Who is the father of\nany son that any son should love him or he any son?\nWhat the hell are you driving at?\nI know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.\n_Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea._\nAre you condemned to do this?\n\u2014They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal\nannals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,\nhardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,\nlesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with\ngrandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son\nunborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases\ncare. He is a new male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth\nhis father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.\nIn rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.\n\u2014What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.\nAm I a father? If I were?\nShrunken uncertain hand.\n\u2014Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the\nfield, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of\nAquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the\nfather who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a\nfather be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another\npoet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not\nthe father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and\nfelt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own\ngrandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token,\nnever was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors\nperfection.\nEglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly\nglancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.\nFlatter. Rarely. But flatter.\n\u2014Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with\nchild. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The\nplay's the thing! Let me parturiate!\nHe clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.\n\u2014As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the forest\nof Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in\n_Coriolanus._ His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in\n_King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the\ngirls in _The Tempest_, in _Pericles,_ in _Winter's Tale_ are we know.\nWho Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may\nguess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.\n\u2014The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.\nThe quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with\nhaste, quake, quack.\nDoor closed. Cell. Day.\nThey list. Three. They.\nI you he they.\nCome, mess.\nSTEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in\nhis old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister\nGatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the\nplaywriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on's back. The\nplayhouse sausage filled Gilbert's soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund\nand a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.\nMAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What's in a name?\nBEST: That is my name, Richard, don't you know. I hope you are going to\nsay a good word for Richard, don't you know, for my sake. _(Laughter)_\nBUCKMULLIGAN: (_Piano, diminuendo_)\nThen outspoke medical Dick\nTo his comrade medical Davy...\nSTEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,\nRichard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles'\nnames. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his\nbrother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.\nBEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don't want Richard, my name\n...\n_(Laughter)_\nQUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...\nSTEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name,\nWilliam, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old\nItaly set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it\nin the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o'Gaunt his\nname is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a\nbend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus,\ndearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What's in\na name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the\nname that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at\nhis birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in\nthe night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the\nrecumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the\nstars. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the\nbear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight\nreturning from Shottery and from her arms.\nBoth satisfied. I too.\nDon't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.\nAnd from her arms.\nWait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?\nRead the skies. _Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos._ Where's your\nconfiguration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: _sua donna.\nGi\u00e0: di lui. Gelindo risolve di non amare S. D._\n\u2014What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a\ncelestial phenomenon?\n\u2014A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.\nWhat more's to speak?\nStephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.\n_Stephanos,_ my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my\nfeet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.\n\u2014You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is\nstrange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.\nMe, Magee and Mulligan.\nFabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto?\nNewhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus.\n_Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing\nbe.\nMr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:\n\u2014That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know,\nwe find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three\nbrothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. The\nthird brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best\nprize.\nBest of Best brothers. Good, better, best.\nThe quaker librarian springhalted near.\n\u2014I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you\nto suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps\nI am anticipating?\nHe caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.\nAn attendant from the doorway called:\n\u2014Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...\n\u2014O, Father Dineen! Directly.\nSwiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.\nJohn Eglinton touched the foil.\n\u2014Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.\nYou kept them for the last, didn't you?\n\u2014In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and\nnuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A\nbrother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.\nLapwing.\nWhere is your brother? Apothecaries' hall. My whetstone. Him, then\nCranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They\nmock to try you. Act. Be acted on.\nLapwing.\nI am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.\nOn.\n\u2014You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he\ntook the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?\nRichard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann\n(what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard\nthe conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The\nother four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his\nkings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence,\nthe angel of the world. Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which\nEdmund figures lifted out of Sidney's _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to\na Celtic legend older than history?\n\u2014That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine\na Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. _Que\nvoulez-vous?_ Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and\nmakes Ulysses quote Aristotle.\n\u2014Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the\nusurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to\nShakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of\nbanishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds\nuninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero\nbreaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his\nbook. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in\nanother, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.\nIt repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married\ndaughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it\nwas the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will\nand left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my\nlords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin,\ncommitted by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the\nlines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under\nwhich her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it.\nBeauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety\neverywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_,\ntwice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure\nfor Measure_\u2014and in all the other plays which I have not read.\nHe laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.\nJudge Eglinton summed up.\n\u2014The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He\nis all in all.\n\u2014He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.\nAll in all. In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold. He\nacts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jos\u00e9 he\nkills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago\nceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.\n\u2014Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!\nDark dome received, reverbed.\n\u2014And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When\nall is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _p\u00e8re?)_ is right. After God\nShakespeare has created most.\n\u2014Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after\na life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has\nalways been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of\nlife ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The\nmotion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet _p\u00e8re_ and Hamlet _fils._ A\nking and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what\nthough murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,\nDane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom\nthey refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it:\nprosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of\nlove, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the\nplace where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world\nwithout as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck\nsays: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated\non his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps\nwill tend._ Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through\nourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,\nwidows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright\nwho wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light\nfirst and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom\nthe most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless\nall in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and\ncuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet,\nthere are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being\na wife unto himself.\n_\u2014Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried. _Eureka!_\nSuddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's\ndesk.\n\u2014May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.\nHe began to scribble on a slip of paper.\nTake some slips from the counter going out.\n\u2014Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,\nshall live. The rest shall keep as they are.\nHe laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.\nUnwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his\nvariorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._\n\u2014You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have\nbrought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe\nyour own theory?\n\u2014No, Stephen said promptly.\n\u2014Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a\ndialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.\nJohn Eclecticon doubly smiled.\n\u2014Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment\nfor it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is\nsome mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man\nPiper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes\nthat the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to\nvisit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor\nwrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he\nbelieves his theory.\nI believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or\nhelp me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? _Egomen._ Who to unbelieve?\nOther chap.\n\u2014You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.\nThen I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an\narticle on economics.\nFraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.\n\u2014For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.\nBuck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then\ngravely said, honeying malice:\n\u2014I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper\nMecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa\ncontra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly\nand Rosalie, the coalquay whore.\nHe broke away.\n\u2014Come, Kinch. Come, wandering \u00c6ngus of the birds.\nCome, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts\nand offals.\nStephen rose.\nLife is many days. This will end.\n\u2014We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. _Notre ami_ Moore says\nMalachi Mulligan must be there.\nBuck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.\n\u2014Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of\nIreland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk\nstraight?\nLaughing, he...\nSwill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.\nLubber...\nStephen followed a lubber...\nOne day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His\nlub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.\nStephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a\nwellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering\ndaylight of no thought.\nWhat have I learned? Of them? Of me?\nWalk like Haines now.\nThe constant readers' room. In the readers' book Cashel Boyle O'Connor\nFitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet\nmad? The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.\n\u2014O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...\nAmused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,\nselfnodding:\n\u2014A pleased bottom.\nThe turnstile.\nIs that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...\nThe curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.\nPuck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:\nJohn Eglinton, my jo, John,\nWhy won't you wed a wife?\nHe spluttered to the air:\n\u2014O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their\nplaybox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. Our players are creating a\nnew art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I\nsmell the pubic sweat of monks.\nHe spat blank.\nForgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And\nleft the _femme de trente ans._ And why no other children born? And his\nfirst child a girl?\nAfterwit. Go back.\nThe dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,\nminion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair.\nEh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...\n\u2014Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there...\nPuck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:\nI hardly hear the purlieu cry\nOr a Tommy talk as I pass one by\nBefore my thoughts begin to run\nOn F. M'Curdy Atkinson,\nThe same that had the wooden leg\nAnd that filibustering filibeg\nThat never dared to slake his drouth,\nMagee that had the chinless mouth.\nBeing afraid to marry on earth\nThey masturbated for all they were worth.\nJest on. Know thyself.\nHalted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.\n\u2014Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing\nblack to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are\nblack.\nA laugh tripped over his lips.\n\u2014Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that\nold hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a\njob on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.\nCouldn't you do the Yeats touch?\nHe went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:\n\u2014The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.\nOne thinks of Homer.\nHe stopped at the stairfoot.\n\u2014I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.\nThe pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men's\nmorrice with caps of indices.\nIn sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:\n_Everyman His Own Wife\nor\nA Honeymoon in the Hand\n(a national immorality in three orgasms)\nby\nBallocky Mulligan._\nHe turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:\n\u2014The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.\nHe read, _marcato:_\n\u2014Characters:\nTOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)\nCRAB (a bushranger)\nMEDICAL DICK )\nand ) (two birds with one stone)\nMEDICAL DAVY )\nMOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)\nFRESH NELLY\nand\nROSALIE (the coalquay whore).\nHe laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:\nand mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:\n\u2014O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift\ntheir skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,\nmulticoloured, multitudinous vomit!\n\u2014The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted\nthem.\nAbout to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.\nPart. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,\nif Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must\ncome to, ineluctably.\nMy will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.\nA man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.\n\u2014Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.\nThe portico.\nHere I watched the birds for augury. \u00c6ngus of the birds. They go, they\ncome. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots\nafter. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.\n\u2014The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. Did you\nsee his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient\nmariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.\nManner of Oxenford.\nDay. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.\nA dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,\nunder portcullis barbs.\nThey followed.\nOffend me still. Speak on.\nKind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds.\nFrail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in\na flaw of softness softly were blown.\nCease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:\nfrom wide earth an altar.\nLaud we the gods\nAnd let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils\nFrom our bless'd altars.",

What was that boy's name\nagain? Dignam. Yes. _Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the\nperson to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible.\nGood practical catholic: useful at mission time.\nA onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his\ncrutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the\nsisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very\nreverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his\npurse held, he knew, one silver crown.\nFather Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,\nof soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,\nending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words:\n_If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have\nabandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of\nsunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy\nM.P.\n\u2014Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?\nFather Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton\nprobably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at\nBelvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear\nthat. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still\nsitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful\nindeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would\ncome again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man\nreally.\nFather Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.\nIooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.\nYes, he would certainly call.\n\u2014Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.\nFather Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the\njet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,\nin going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\nFather Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father\nBernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.\n\u2014Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?\nA zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his\nway. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.\nOf good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?\nO, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.\nFather Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy\nsquare. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were\nthey good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his\nname? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little\nman? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.\nFather Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and\npointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.\n\u2014But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.\nThe boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:\n\u2014O, sir.\n\u2014Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.\nMaster Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter\nto father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father\nConmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square\neast.\nMr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate\nfrockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender\ntrousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave\ndeportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady\nMaxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.\nWas that not Mrs M'Guinness?\nMrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the\nfarther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and\nsaluted. How did she do?\nA fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to\nthink that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he\nsay?... such a queenly mien.\nFather Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the\nshutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will\n(D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on\nhim to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible\nignorance. They acted according to their lights.\nFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular\nroad. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an\nimportant thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.\nA band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All\nraised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.\nChristian brother boys.\nFather Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint\nJoseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father\nConmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but\noccasionally they were also badtempered.\nNear Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift\nnobleman. And now it was an office or something.\nFather Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted\nby Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father\nConmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came\nfrom baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the\nTobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful\ncatastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually\nhappening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an\nact of perfect contrition.\nFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of\nwhich two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.\nFather Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny\nKelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.\nA constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted\nthe constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee\nobserved pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in\ntubes.\nMoored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a\nturfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty\nstraw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above\nhim. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of\nthe Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out\nand bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor\npeople.\nOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis\nXavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound",

C. of\nsaint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.\nAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for\nhe disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.\nFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with\ncare in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a\nsixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into\nhis purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket\ninspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away\nthe ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father\nConmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked\ncheerful decorum.\nIt was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father\nConmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee\nsupposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman\nwith the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so\ngently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and\nsmiled tinily, sweetly.\nFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that\nthe awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the\nseat.\nFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the\nmouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.\nAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old\nwoman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the\nbellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a\nmarketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and\nbasket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed\nthe end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had\nalways to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been\nabsolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many\ncares, poor creatures.\nFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at\nFather Conmee.\nFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men\nand of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission\nand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and\nbrown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when\ntheir last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the\nBelgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des \u00c9lus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a\nreasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in\nHis Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But\nthey were God's souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a\npity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.",

It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.\nThe joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,\nimmediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.\nThen came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.\nThose were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old\ntimes in the barony.\nFather Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the\nBarony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and\nof Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of\nBelvedere.\nA listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,\nMary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,\nnot startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the\njealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed\nadultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with\nher husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned\nas women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.\nFather Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however\nfor man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our\nways.\nDon John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and\nhonoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at\nsmiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit\nclusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,\nwere impalmed by Don John Conmee.\nIt was a charming day.\nThe lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,\ncurtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of\nsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind. _Moutonner,_ the French\nsaid. A just and homely word.\nFather Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds\nover Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of\nClongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the\ncries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet\nevening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.\nFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.\nAn ivory bookmark told him the page.\nNones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had\ncome.\nFather Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.\n_Deus in adiutorium._\nHe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he\ncame to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:\nin eternum omnia iudicia iustiti\u00e6 tu\u00e6._\nA flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a\nyoung woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised\nhis cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care\ndetached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\nFather Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his\nbreviary. _Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis\nformidavit cor meum._",

Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his\npliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps\nthere.\nThe vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long\nsoft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and\nmouldy air closed round them.\n\u2014How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.\n\u2014Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic\ncouncil chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed\nhimself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.\nO'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.\nThe old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and\nthe original jews' temple was here too before they built their\nsynagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were\nyou?\n\u2014No, Ned.\n\u2014He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory\nserves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.\n\u2014That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.\n\u2014If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to\nallow me perhaps...\n\u2014Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll\nget those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here\nor from here.\nIn the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the\npiled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.\nFrom a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.\n\u2014I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass\non your valuable time...\n\u2014You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next\nweek, say. Can you see?\n\u2014Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.\n\u2014Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.\nHe followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away\namong the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's\nabbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut\nmeal, O'Connor, Wexford.\nHe stood to read the card in his hand.",

Got round him all right. How do you\ndo, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your\nother establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping\nalive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country.\nThose farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your\nbest gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that\n_General Slocum_ explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.\nAnd heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most\nbrutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion.\nMost scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the\nfirehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever\nallowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins.\nYou know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look\nat that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we\nwere bad here.\nI smiled at him. _America,_ I said quietly, just like that. _What is\nit? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true?_\nThat's a fact.\nGraft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's\nalways someone to pick it up.\nSaw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy\nappearance. Bowls them over.\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\nMr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter\nKennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson\nstreet. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built\nunder three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street\nclub toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian\nbank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he\nremembered me.\nAham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.\nGentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom\nagain, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying\nhas it.\nNorth wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains,\nsailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on\nthe ferrywash, Elijah is coming.\nMr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.\nGrizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy\nbody forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned\nLambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn\nit. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash\nlike that. Damn like him.\nAham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.\nGood drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to\nhis fat strut.\nDown there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope.\nDogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife\ndrove by in her noddy.\nBad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too.\nFourbottle men.",

      "text": "William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by\nlieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the\nviceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs\nPaget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. in\nattendance.\nThe cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by\nobsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern\nquays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the\nmetropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted\nhim vainly from afar. Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord\nDudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley\nWhite, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's,\nthe pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose\nwith his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough\nmore quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot\nthrough Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the\nporch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,\nCollis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the\ndoorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the\nPatriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed\nher plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously\non the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall\nunder Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of\nliquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by\nbronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired.\nOn Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse\nfor the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his\nhat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From\nCahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M. A., made obeisance\nunperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held\nof yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking\nleave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger\nGreene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,\ncarrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid\nup, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she\ncouldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's\nbig yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its\nbeing the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of\nKavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness\ntowards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The\nRight Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed\nMicky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax\nsmartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_\nJames. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the\napproach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley\nfixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret\nwaistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming _soubrette,_ great\nMarie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from\nher poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon\nlieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald\nWard A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and\nHaines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders\nof eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon\nJohn Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus,\nstraining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw\nsunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry\nMenton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from\nwinebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in\nhis fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's\nhorse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from\nunder the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings.\nUnderstanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the\nsecond carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably\nsurprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white\nflagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him,\nE.L.Y.'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's\nmusic warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily\napparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By\nthe provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes\nand socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl's a Yorkshire\ngirl._\nBlazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high\naction a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a\nsuit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute\nbut he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and\nthe red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His\nExcellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of\nmusic which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen\nhighland laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cort\u00e8ge_:\nBut though she's a factory lass\nAnd wears no fancy clothes.\nBaraabum.\nYet I've a sort of a\nYorkshire relish for\nMy little Yorkshire rose.\nBaraabum.\nThither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.\nShrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F.\nStevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding\npast Finn's hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell\nstared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr\nM. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate.\nDeep in Leinster street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man,\nHornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by\nMerrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes\nbeing given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black\ncap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up.\nThe viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds\nfor Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount\nstreet. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower\nMount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread,\npassed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal\nCanal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips\nagrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road\ncorner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in\nwhich eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady\nmayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne\nroads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male\nwalkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the\nhouse said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the\nIrish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the\nsalute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing\ndoor.",

Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a\npony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen\nlong John's eye. U. p ....\nAnd he started laughing.\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\n\u2014Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\nTerence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full\nof the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and\nBungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of\ndeathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and\nmass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour\njuices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day\nfrom their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,\nthat nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that\nthirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\nBut he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be\noutdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a\ntestoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork\nwas seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of\nBrunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of\nGod of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the\nBritish dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress\nof India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the\nwellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to\nthe going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\n\u2014What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and\ndown outside?\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\u2014Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging,\nI'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his\npocket.\n\u2014Are you codding? says I.\n\u2014Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\nSo Joe took up the letters.\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust. Bob's a queer chap when\nthe porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:\n\u2014How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?\n\u2014I don't know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy\nDignam. Only I was running after that...\n\u2014You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\n\u2014With Dignam, says Alf.\n\u2014Is it Paddy? says Joe.\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Why?\n\u2014Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.\n\u2014Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\n\u2014Ay, says Joe.\n\u2014Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as\na pikestaff.\n\u2014Who's dead? says Bob Doran.\n\u2014You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\n\u2014What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray\nwith him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam\ndead?\n\u2014What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?\n\u2014Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.\n\u2014Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning\nanyhow.\n\u2014Paddy? says Alf.\n\u2014Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\n\u2014Good Christ! says Alf.",

Antitreating is\nabout the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down\nhis throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth\nof his pint.

Someone\nthat has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono\npublico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of\nthat.

The ceremony which went off with great _\u00e9clat_ was\ncharacterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll\nof ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to\nthe distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the\ncommunity and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,\ntastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work\nwhich reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.\nThe departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of\nthose who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of\nIrish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,\nfollowed immediately by _Rak\u00f3czsy's March_. Tarbarrels and bonfires\nwere lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the\nHill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains\nof Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the\nNagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of\nM'Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid\ncheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a\nbig muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,\nthe mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final\nfloral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were\npresent in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,\nescorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and\nCustom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical\npower station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.\n_Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra, kedv\u00e9s bar\u00e1tom! Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra!_ Gone but not\nforgotten.\nGob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin\nanyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he\nshouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's\nroyal theatre:\n\u2014Where is he till I murder him?\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\n\u2014Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other\nway and off with him.\n\u2014Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the\nsun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent\nit into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old\nmongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting\nand laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The\nobservatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the\nfifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a\nsimilar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,\nthe year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to\nhave been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay\nward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,\ntwo roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in\nthe vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble\nedifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal\ndebates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it\nis to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the\nreports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were\naccompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic\ncharacter. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the\nmuch respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a\nsilk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat\nof arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of\nquarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been\ndiscovered by search parties in remote parts of the island\nrespectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's\ncauseway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in\nthe sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other\neyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of\nenormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying\nvelocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of\ncondolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the\ndifferent continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously\npleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be\ncelebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral\nchurch of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority\nof the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who\nhave been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.

      "text": "The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious\nembrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of\nall too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud\npromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on\nthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on\nthe quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the\nstillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a\nbeacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\nThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening\nscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and\noft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy\nchat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy\nCaffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and\nJacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits\nwith caps to match and the name _H. M. S. Belleisle_ printed on both.\nFor Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very\nnoisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little\nfellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They\nwere dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building\ncastles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy\nas the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to\nand fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with\ndelight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a\ntiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy\nCaffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty\ndimple in his chin.\n\u2014Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of\nwater.\nAnd baby prattled after her:\n\u2014A jink a jink a jawbo.\nCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of\nchildren, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could\nnever be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that\nheld his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown\nbread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But\nto be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in\nhis new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,\nwas Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life,\nalways with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her\ncherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman\nlaughed too at the quaint language of little brother.\nBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and\nMaster Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to\nthis golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand\nwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go\nwrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like\nthe Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky\nwas selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's\nhouse is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose\nthat the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the\ncoveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master\nTommy drew the attention of the girl friends.\n\u2014Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,\nJacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I\ncatch you for that.\nHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for\ntheir big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he\nwas too after his misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and\nunmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the\nart of smoothing over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one\nspeck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue\neyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed\naway the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and\nsaid if she was near him she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing\nin admonition.\n\u2014Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\nShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\n\u2014What's your name? Butter and cream?\n\u2014Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your\nsweetheart?\n\u2014Nao, tearful Tommy said.\n\u2014Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said.\n\u2014I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from\nher shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy's sweetheart. Gerty is\nTommy's sweetheart.\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\nCissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy\nBoardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman\ncouldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.\nBut who was Gerty?\nGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,\ngazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a\nspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was\npronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said,\nshe was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and\ngraceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had\nbeen taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the\nWidow Welch's female pills and she was much better of those discharges\nshe used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face\nwas almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth\nwas a genuine Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely\nveined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and\nqueen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used\nto wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple\ntold that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black\nout at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their\nlittle tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told\nher not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or\nshe'd never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There\nwas an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which\nwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.\nHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in\nher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education\nGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the\nland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow\nand patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their\ndevoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that\nlent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed\nmeaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful\neyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery?\nGerty's were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and\ndark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily\nseductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful\npage of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try\neyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so\nbecoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then\nthere was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase\nyour height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would\nsuit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning\nglory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a\nnatural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the\nnew moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of\nluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And\njust now at Edy's words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest\nrosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet\ngirlish shyness that of a surety God's fair land of Ireland did not\nhold her equal.\nFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was\nabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.\nInclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.\nThe pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out\ninto a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young\nMay morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy\nsay that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a\nlovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about\nthe boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding\nup and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in\nthe evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate\nthat was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a\ndoctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who\nwas racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little\nrecked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart\nsometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he\nmight learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family\nand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed\nVirgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an\nexquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the\nshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would\nknow anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the\nbicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice\nperfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size\ntoo he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so\nfrightfully clever because he didn't go and ride up and down in front\nof her bit of a garden.\nGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of\nDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be\nout. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because\nit was expected in the _Lady's Pictorial_ that electric blue would be\nworn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket\n(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her\nfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy\nthreequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful\nfigure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of\nwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue\nchenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday\nweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she\nfound what she wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly\nshopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.\nShe did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on\nthen, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to\nher! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew\nthat that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes\nwere the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she\nwas very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a\nfive, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one\nsmart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed\nits perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount\nand no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with\nhighspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's\nchief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet\nseventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in\nhis heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty\nstitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with\ndifferent coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen,\nand she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the\nwash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because\nshe wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching\nthe things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her\nown colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on\nher because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his\nfather brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and\nbecause she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was\ndressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside\nout and that was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things\non inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so\nlong as it wasn't of a Friday.\nAnd yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is\nthere all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give\nworlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving\nway to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings\nthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the\nmirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls\nupon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.\nYes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage\nhas been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.\nC. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs\nWylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was\nwearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox\nwas not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in\nlove, a woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer's\n(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an\narm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her\nlittle one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the\nfirst!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from\nthe room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength\nof character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would\nwoo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting,\nalways waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be\nover. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous\nlove at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who\nhad not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,\nand who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her\nto him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort\nher with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she\nyearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be\nhis only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in\nhealth, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.\nAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was\njust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his\nlittle wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue\nin the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she\nwould be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature\ncomforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked\nthat feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue\nand queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden\nopinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a\nfire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same\ndirection, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of\neggs though she didn't like the eating part when there were any people\nthat made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something\npoetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully\nappointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph\nof grandpapa Giltrap's lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was\nso human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in\nClery's summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be\ntall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a\nhusband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed\nsweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their\nhoneymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in\na nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both\nhave brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and\nbefore he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a\ngood hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.\nEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then\nshe buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run\noff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy\nsaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with\nthe ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said\nit was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if\nyou please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy\nCaffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off\nnow with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.\n\u2014You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball.\nBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her\nfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand\nand Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.\n\u2014Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.\nAnd she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played\nhere's the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread\ncarriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper\nchin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way\nlike that from everyone always petting him.\n\u2014I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't\nsay.\n\u2014On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.\nGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy\nsaying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her\nlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was\nsure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared\nCiss.\n\u2014Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of\nher nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at\nhim.\nMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.\nFor instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea\nand jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on\nher nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to\ngo where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the\nMiss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget\nher the evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the\nburned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a\ncigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was\nsincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever\nmade, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.\nAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the\npealing anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat\nconducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary,\nsermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there\ngathered together without distinction of social class (and a most\nedifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,\nafter the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the\nimmaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her\nto intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin\nof virgins. How sad to poor Gerty's ears! Had her father only avoided\nthe clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders\nthe drink habit cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in\nher carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that\nas she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp\nbecause she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window\ndreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.\nBut that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had\ncast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in\nthe home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen\nher own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself\ncompletely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it\nwas that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of\nkindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.\nAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,\nVirgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard\nher companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman\noff Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like\nhimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him\nany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\nfather because he was too old or something or on account of his face\n(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the\npimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor\nfather! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,\nMary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they\nhad stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for supper\nand when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died\nsuddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her\nmother's birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom\nand Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have\nhad a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now\nhe was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a\nwarning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the\nfuneral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him\nthe letters and samples from his office about Catesby's cork lino,\nartistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and\nalways bright and cheery in the home.\nA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the\nhouse, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in\ngold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was\nit rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't\nlike her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single\nthing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the\nworld of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas\nat the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of\nthat place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime\nMr Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days\nwhere a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a\nthreecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with\noldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a\nstory behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a\nsoft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in\nchocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them\ndreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own\narms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and\nthought about those times because she had found out in Walker's\npronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the\nhalcyon days what they meant.\nThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till\nat last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no\ngetting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he\ncould down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was\nnot slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was\nsitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted\nthe ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries\nand to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it\nto her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then\nthrew it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the\nslope and stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the\nrock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it\naway and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she\nwished their stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a\nkick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\n\u2014If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\nGerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her\npretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted\nher skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball\na jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it\ndown towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else\nto draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She\nfelt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell,\nsurging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged\nglances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she\nventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the\ntwilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had\never seen.\nThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted\nand with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain\nof original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray\nfor us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And\ncareworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many\nwho had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all\nthat bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told\nthem what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary,\nthe most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in\nany age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever\nabandoned by her.\nThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\nchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with\nbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.\nPeep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was\nCissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my\nword, didn't the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say\npapa.\n\u2014Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.\nAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for\neleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of\nhealth, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out\nto be something great, they said.\n\u2014Haja ja ja haja.\nCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to\nsit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried\nout, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half\nblanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most\nobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\n\u2014Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\nAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all\nno use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the\ngeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave\nhim in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen\nwas quickly appeased.\nGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out\nof that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little\nbrats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the\npaintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured\nchalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out,\nthe evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and\nto hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they\nburned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart\nwent pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning\nin his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her\nthrough and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were,\nsuperbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer.\nShe could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face\nthat he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin\nHarvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred\nbecause she wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they\ntwo to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see\nwhether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retrouss\u00e9_ from where he\nwas sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story\nof a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given\nworlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still,\nand he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel\nbuckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the\ntoes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the\ntransparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was\nfar away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he\nwho mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him\nbecause she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. The very\nheart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she\nknew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against\nthan sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked\nman, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could\nconvert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted\nhealing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty\ngirls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they\nhadn't got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she\ncould make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the\npast. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,\ncrushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for\nherself alone.\nRefuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. _Ora pro nobis_. Well\nhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy\ncan never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge\nfor the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her\nown heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the\nstained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue\nbanners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping\nCanon O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes\ncast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet\nand clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever\nshe became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come\nto the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time\nwhen she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots\nof her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was\nonly the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws, he\nsaid, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the\nnature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady\nherself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to\nThy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and\nthought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design\nfor him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the\nmantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little\nhouse to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the\nforty hours' adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a\npresent to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or\nsome place.\nThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky\nthrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little\nmonkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them\na good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\nthem. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they\nwere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\n\u2014Jacky! Tommy!\nNot they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very\nlast time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and\nshe ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had\na good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the\nthingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow\nlong because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat\nat it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip\nup her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a\nlot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece\nwhenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just\nbecause she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see\nall the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as\npossible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up\nover something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French\nheels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. _Tableau!_\nThat would have been a very charming expos\u00e9 for a gentleman like that\nto witness.\nQueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\nthey prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy\nhanded the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and\ncensed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and\nshe was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she\ndidn't because she thought he might be watching but she never made a\nbigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking\nthat he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed\nthe thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the\nBlessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she\njust swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to\nthe _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_. Three and eleven she paid for those\nstockings in Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday\nbefore Easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was\nlooking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had\nneither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his\nhead to see the difference for himself.\nCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\nher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a\nstreel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought\nonly a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her\npetticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a\nmoment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown\ntresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders\u2014a radiant little vision,\nin sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel\nmany a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She\ncould almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes\nthat set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she\ncould see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster\nfor her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was\neying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that\nshe had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet\nswept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a\nglorious rose.\nEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,\nhalf smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\nbaby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was\nwhy no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no\nconcern of hers. And she said to Gerty:\n\u2014A penny for your thoughts.\n\u2014What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I\nwas only wondering was it late.\nBecause she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and\ntheir babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just\ngave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy\nasked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was\nhalf past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know\nbecause they were told to be in early.\n\u2014Wait, said Cissy, I'll run ask my uncle Peter over there what's the\ntime by his conundrum.\nSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\nhand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\nwatchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was\nGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment\nhe had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and\nthe next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol\nexpressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\nCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the\nright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to\nit and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry\nhis watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the\nsun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\nmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\nCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\nhis waterworks were out of order.\nThen they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O'Hanlon\ngot up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he\ntold Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire\nto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and\nshe could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the\nworks and she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting\ndarker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was\nwinding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it\nback and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a\nsensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp\nand that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on\nbecause the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of\nthe moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her\nevery contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was\nundisguised admiration in a man's passionate gaze it was there plain to\nbe seen on that man's face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you\nknow it.\nEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty\nnoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect\nbecause it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place\nto push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied\ntheir hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon\nstood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed\nhim the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti\neis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and\nasking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just\nanswered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she\nheartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply.\nA brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn\nimmeasurable. It hurt\u2014O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet\nway of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded\nlittle cat she was. Gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but\nshe fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,\nso beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.\nShe had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle\nlike all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and\nfor an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.\nTheir eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she\nsparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them\nto see.\n\u2014O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\nflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.\nHer words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\nringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young\nvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As\nfor Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck\nhim aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as\nmuch as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a\ndozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him\none look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.\nMiss puny little Edy's countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty\ncould see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a\ntowering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft\nhad struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was\nsomething aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and\nnever would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it\nso they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\nEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked\nin the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because\nthe sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told\nhim too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and\nbaby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and\nCissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,\nwithout as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and\nsundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.\n\u2014O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.\nThe slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set\nthat little matter to rights.\nGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy\nasked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was\nflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed\nit off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction\nbecause just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet\nseashore because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that\nFather Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the\nBlessed Sacrament in his hands.\nHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse\nof Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time\na bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,\nthither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of\nthe lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of\npaints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the\nlamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church\ngrounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked\nand lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn\nhis freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss\nCummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales. For Gerty had her\ndreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a\nkeepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the\ncoralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of\nher toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was\nscrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure\ntrove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose\nscent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to\nchange when her things came home from the wash and there were some\nbeautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in\nHely's of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if\nshe could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so\ndeeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening\nround the potherbs. _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J\nWalsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt\nthou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient\nloveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the\nyears were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one\nshortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an\naccident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.\nBut it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there\nwould be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would\nmake the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his\nthoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his\ndays with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was\ndying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife\nor some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land\nof song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But\neven if\u2014what then? Would it make a very great difference? From\neverything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively\nrecoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the\naccommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and\ncoarse men with no respect for a girl's honour, degrading the sex and\nbeing taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be\njust good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other\nin spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was\nan old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She\nthought she understood. She would try to understand him because men\nwere so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white\nhands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would\nfollow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he\nwas her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was\nthe master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be\nwild, untrammelled, free.\nCanon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and\ngenuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then\nhe locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and\nFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked\nwasn't she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:\n\u2014O, look, Cissy!\nAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over\nthe trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.\n\u2014It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.\nAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,\nhelterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy\nholding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running.\n\u2014Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It's the bazaar fireworks.\nBut Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and\ncall. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she\ncould see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set\nher pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,\nand a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face,\npassion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were\nleft alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he\ncould be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of\ninflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working\nand a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the\nfireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall\nback looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she\nrevealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply\nsoft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his\nheart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of\nmen like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead\nsecret and made her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that\nwas staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had\npictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and\nshe said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine\nsometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing\nlike that because there was all the difference because she could almost\nfeel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his\nhandsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn't do\nthe other thing before being married and there ought to be women\npriests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy\nCaffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes\nso that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors'\nphotographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on\nthe way it did.\nAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned\nback and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent\nand they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was\nand she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something\nqueer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And\nshe saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in\nthe tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went\nhigher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up\nafter it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused\nwith a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see\nher other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the\nskin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,\non account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and\nthen it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was\ntrembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full\nview high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or\nwading and she wasn't ashamed and he wasn't either to look in that\nimmodest way like that because he couldn't resist the sight of the\nwondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so\nimmodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She\nwould fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms\nto him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a\nyoung girl's love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry\nthat has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot\nblind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh\nof O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a\nstream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all\ngreeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet,\nsoft!\nThen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She\nglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of\npiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.\nHe was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is\nhe) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.\nWhat a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called\nto him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he\nhad been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in\nthose eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and\nsinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That\nwas their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there\nwas none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly\nthrough the evening to and fro and little bats don't tell.\nCissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to\nshow what a great person she was: and then she cried:\n\u2014Gerty! Gerty! We're going. Come on. We can see from farther up.\nGerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She slipped a hand into\nher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of\ncourse without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too\nfar to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet\nagain, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her\ndream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their\nsouls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her\nheart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet\nflowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile,\na smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.\nSlowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,\nto Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was\ndarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and\nslippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic",

That's why she's\nleft on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was\nwrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse\nin a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn't know it when she was\non show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn't mind. Curiosity like\na nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is\ndelicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I\nhave such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all\nright. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla\nconvent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the\nend I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha,\nshe. Something in the air. That's the moon. But then why don't all\nwomen menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends\non the time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out\nof step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of\nthat. Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her\nsilly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this\nmorning. That gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife\nengagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for\nsmall mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it\nthemselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured\nout of offices. Reserve better. Don't want it they throw it at you.\nCatch em alive, O. Pity they can't see themselves. A dream of\nwellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel\nstreet: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy's hat and what the girls did\nwith it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? _Lingerie_\ndoes it. Felt for the curves inside her _d\u00e9shabill\u00e9._ Excites them also\nwhen they're. I'm all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing\none another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly's new blouse.\nAt first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her\nthe violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and\nturnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we\nmet. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman\nloses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy\nlost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part\nof their charm. Just changes when you're on the track of the secret.\nExcept the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer\nrefused. She wasn't in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they\nare. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They\nbelieve in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to\ngive her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other's\nnecks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about\nnothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs\nand their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they\ncan't get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I'll write to\nyou. Now won't you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes along,\nthen meet once in a blue moon. _Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the\nlove of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with\nyourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in\neach other's appearance. You're looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing\ntheir teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn't lend each\nother a pinch of salt.\nAh!\nDevils they are when that's coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.\nMolly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my\nfoot. O that way! O, that's exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest\nonce in a way. Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. Safe in one\nway. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering\nplants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she\nwears she's a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like\nthat you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look\nat. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and\nlions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or\nsomething. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike\nrough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me.\nWonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with\nbearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid\ngentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn't\nlet her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly\nmen marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can't be so if Molly.\nTook off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face,\nmeeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers\nto smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when\nwe were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her\nmoney. Why not? All a prejudice. She's worth ten, fifteen, more, a\npound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion.\nDid I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent\nto Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie's without a necktie. Wrangle\nwith Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he's\nanother. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four.\nDust. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was\nthat just when he, she?\nO, he did. Into her. She did. Done.\nAh!\nMr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that\nlittle limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not\npleasant. Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don't care.\nComplimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night\nprayers with the kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil\nall. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.\nThe name too. _Amours_ of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud\nBranscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered\nwith pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel.\nThe strength it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let\noff there behind the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was.\nOtherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. _Lacaus esant\ntaratara_. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you\ndon't know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask\nyou another. Good idea if you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a\ncart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she's\non for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I\nnearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath\nstreet that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of\ncourse. My arks she called it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If\nyou don't answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they\nharden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.\nParrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn't\ncalled me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a\nsingle girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman.\nOr even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other\nchap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today\nspitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook.\nCause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't think.\nCome in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they\nchange the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like\nmushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what\nsomeone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I\nwent the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did.\nShe too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something\nawfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been\nthinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came\nto the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The\npropitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by\ntheir eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till\ntheir dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the\nMoorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts\nwere developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when\nwe drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord\nmayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.\nThere she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up\nlike a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be,\nwaiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in\nmother's clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.\nAnd the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she\ncould whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass\nwhore in Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind,\nplease, telling me the right time? I'll tell you the right time up a\ndark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for\nfat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game.\nOf course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.\nDidn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that\nsatisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.\nFine eyes she had, clear. It's the white of the eye brings that out not\nso much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting\nbeyond a dog's jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high\nschool drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call\nthat innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.\nNever see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_. Eyes all over them.\nLook under the bed for what's not there. Longing to get the fright of\ntheir lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at\nthe corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,\ntwigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that?\nTypist going up Roger Greene's stairs two at a time to show her\nunderstandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.\nBred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the\nmirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman's eye\non a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly's Paisley shawl to\nPrescott's by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her\nstocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries\nparcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand,\nshaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you\nlearn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don't they\nknow! Three years old she was in front of Molly's dressingtable, just\nbefore we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who\nknows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway\nnot like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are.\nSwell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.\nNot like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in\nGrafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.\nA monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads\nand zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see\nand Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the\nrocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion.\nDarling, I saw, your. I saw all.\nLord!\nDid me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For\nthis relief much thanks. In _Hamlet,_ that is. Lord! It was all things\ncombined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of\nmy tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He's right. Might have made a\nworse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I\nwill tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It\ncouldn't be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however\nlike my name and the address Dolphin's barn a blind.\nHer maiden name was Jemina Brown\nAnd she lived with her mother in Irishtown.\nPlace made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.\nWiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if\nit understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw\nanything straight at school. Crooked as a ram's horn. Sad however\nbecause it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping\nand papa's pants will soon fit Willy and fuller's earth for the baby\nwhen they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them\nout of harm's way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.\nChildren's hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even\nclosed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.\nOughtn't to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up\nwith wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is\nnurse Callan there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly\nwas in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her\nbrushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too,\nmarriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City\nArms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.\nHave that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in\nthe morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the\nhusband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like\nglue. Maybe the women's fault also. That's where Molly can knock spots\noff them. It's the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the\nfigure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those\nothers. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to\nintroduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript,\nwouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his\nwife. Still there's destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own\nsecrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman\ndidn't take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a\nshilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched\nthem. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one.\nOr old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent\nin December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is\nnot back. Better detach.\nOw!\nOther hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the\nshort of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch.\nWristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic\ninfluence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I\nsuppose, at once. Cat's away, the mice will play. I remember looking in\nPill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism.\nEarth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement.\nAnd time, well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing\nstopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it's all\narranged. Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the\nstars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come.\nCome. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up\nand look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if\nyou're a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look\nand if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.\nWonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third\nperson. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw\nstuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at\nthe horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine\nvoice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like\nflowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the\npaint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her\nslipper on the floor so they wouldn't hear. But lots of them can't kick\nthe beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all\nround over me and half down my back.\nWait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave\nyou this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it?\nHeliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that\nkind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,\nwith a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the\ndance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She\nwas wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good\nconductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection.\nFor instance if you go into a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing\ntoo. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,\nslow but sure. Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains blown\nacross. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this\nmorning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It's like a fine\nfine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you\ncall it gossamer, and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as\nanything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything\nshe takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little\nkick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff\nin her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too.\nReminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There\nor the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes\nand corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.\nMuskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years.\nDogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm.\nHm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that\nway. We're the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have\ntheir period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.\nLike what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the\ngrass.\nPerhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long\nJohn had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink\ngives that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because\npriests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like\nflies round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The\ntree of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to.\nThat diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life.\nAnd it's extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.\nMr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.\nAlmonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that's the soap.\nO by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never\nwent back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag\nthis morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could\nmention Meagher's just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph.\nTwo and nine. Bad opinion of me he'll have. Call tomorrow. How much do\nI owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving\ncredit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run\nup a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into\nsomewhere else.\nHere's this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as\nfar as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had\na good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper\nwalk a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government\nsit. Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.\nStill you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as\nwomen don't mock what matter? That's the way to find out. Ask yourself\nwho is he now. _The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr\nLeopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that\nfellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his\nkismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain\nthey say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body\nfeels the atmosphere. Old Betty's joints are on the rack. Mother\nShipton's prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the\ntwinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills\nseem coming nigh.\nHowth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or\nthey might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of\nthe dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds\nflash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt\nyou. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through\nthe small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against.\nScowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in\nthe shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest.\nRoygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,\nviolet. A star I see. Venus? Can't tell yet. Two. When three it's\nnight. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom\nship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of\nthe setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native\nland, goodnight.\nDew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white\nfluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his\nway up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold,\nsore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the\nposition. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don't\nknow how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green\napples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it's the only time we cross\nlegs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy\nchairs under them. But it's the evening influence. They feel all that.\nOpen like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes,\nin ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat\nDillon's garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length\noilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns.\nHistory repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I'm with you once again.\nLife, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her\nlame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.\nThey take advantage.\nAll quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The\nrhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the\nplumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change:\nthat's all. Lovers: yum yum.\nTired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of\nme, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it\ncomes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the\nsame. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing\nnew under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin's Barn. Are you not happy in\nyour? Naughty darling. At Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's\nhouse. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy,\nLouy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the\nold major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I\nan only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into\nyourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he\nand she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip:\ntear in Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle:\ncockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She\nleaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in\nSleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty\nfrom the dew.\nBa. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a\ntree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you\ncould be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he\ngoes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very\nlikely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him\nout, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray\nfor us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition.\nSame thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there's the\nlight in the priest's house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the\nmistake in the valuation when I was in Thom's. Twentyeight it is. Two\nhouses they have. Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder\nwhy they come out at night like mice. They're a mixed breed. Birds are\nlike hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit\nstill. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of\na jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with\ntiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey\nwhite. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example\nlike the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants\nto stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning\non the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with\nthree colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the\n_City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different\ncolours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That's how that\nwise man what's his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes\non fire. It can't be tourists' matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry\nrub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act\nas a burning glass in the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory's not\nso bad.\nBa. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last\nweek got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be\nthe one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what\nthey say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they\nhave to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms,\ntelegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of\noceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like\nseacows. _Faugh a ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in\nvessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake\nwhen the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at\nthe ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it's round.\nWife in every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till\nJohnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail\nend of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor's\nweighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well.\nAnd the tephilim no what's this they call it poor papa's father had on\nhis door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into\nthe house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when\nyou go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of\na beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and\nthat's the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish\never get seasick?\nThen you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,\ncrew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker, moon looking down so\npeaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.\nA last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of\nfunds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of\nviolet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The\nshepherd's hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to\nhouse, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o'clock\npostman, the glowworm's lamp at his belt gleaming here and there\nthrough the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted\nlintstock lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens of lighted\nwindows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening\nTelegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!_ and from\nthe door of Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat\nflew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept,\ngrey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum\nrhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift,\nruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep\nand slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the\nanchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.\nLife those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish\nLights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and\nbreeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in\nthe Erin's King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the\nzoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking\noverboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in\ntheir faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing.\nDon't know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean.\nBut being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I\ndidn't want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with\nmasks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I'll murder you.\nIs it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can\npeople aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only\ntroubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that.\nAfter getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What\ndo they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with\nthe umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking.\nLittle hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when\nyou touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I\nremember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is\nmore sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves\nout if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening\nme. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child!\nStrange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar.\nLooking from Buena Vista. O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old\nBarbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men\nto cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like\nthis, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich\ngentleman coming with a private yacht. _Buenas noches, se\u00f1orita. El\nhombre ama la muchacha hermosa_. Why me? Because you were so foreign\nfrom the others.\nBetter not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you\ndull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for\n_Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital\nto see. Hope she's over. Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral,\nhouse of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that\nbawler in Barney Kiernan's. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what\nI said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought\nto go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in\ncompany. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me.\nLook at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he\nmeant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he\nhawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty.\nParticularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of\nthe wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early\nmorning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he\nkissed the cow. But Dignam's put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so\ndepressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must\ncall to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for\ngranted we're going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it\noutside Cramer's that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but\nprogressing favourably on the premium. Her widow's mite. Well? What do\nyou expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to\nsee. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O'Connor wife and five children\npoisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly\nwoman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and\na large apron. Ladies' grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a\npair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.\nUgly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we\ndie. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the\ntrick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed.\nCurse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She\nhad red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does?\nWould I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti's gone.\nMailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes's. Work\nHynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in\nthem. What's that? Might be money.\nMr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He\nbrought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go.\nBetter. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and\npebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with\nstory of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children\nalways want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the\nwaters. What's this? Bit of stick.\nO! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here\ntomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers\ndo. Will I?\nMr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write\na message for her. Might remain. What?\nI.\nSome flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide\ncomes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark\nmirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and\nletters. O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the\nmeaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not\nlike.\nAM. A.\nNo room. Let it go.\nMr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.\nNothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here.\nExcept Guinness's barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by\ndesign.\nHe flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now\nif you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn't. Chance.\nWe'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made\nme feel so young.\nShort snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.\nNot even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I\nwon't go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a\nmoment. Won't sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same.

Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet\nparts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law\nwere well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to\nprotect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping\nsoldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off\nat any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians\nshould by any chance they fall out over anything. You frittered away\nyour time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character\nbesides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the\n_demimonde_ ran away with a lot of \u00a3. s. d. into the bargain and the\ngreatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the\nmuch vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old\nwine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing\naperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch\nbeliever in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably\ndrew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of\nyour being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he\ncommented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting\n_confr\u00e8res_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his\nbrother medicos under all the circs.\n\u2014And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing\nwhatsoever of any kind.\nDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back\nof the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a\nbrazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one\nattracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord\nstopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren\ncobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just\nmake out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom\nof the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened or had\nbeen mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small\neffort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a\n_quondam_ friend of his father's, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew\nnearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.\n\u2014Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\nA figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches\nsaluted again, calling:\n\u2014Night!\nStephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the\ncompliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch\nas he always believed in minding his own business moved off but\nnevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety\nthough not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he\nknew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next\nto nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising\npeaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some\nsecluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames\nembankment category they might be hanging about there or simply\nmarauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell\nswoop at a moment's notice, your money or your life, leaving you there\nto point a moral, gagged and garrotted.\nStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,\nthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley's\nbreath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him\nand his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of\ninspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a\ncertain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His\ngrandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of\na publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.\nRumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of\nthe lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably\nfine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or\nsome relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had\nenjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This\ntherefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though\ndissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with\nfacetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.\nTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\nNot as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends\nhad all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called\nhim to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of\nother uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of\nStephen to tell him where on God's earth he could get something,\nanything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the\nwashkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they\nwere connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences\nhappening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete\nfabrication from start to finish. Anyhow he was all in.\n\u2014I wouldn't ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows\nI'm on the rocks.\n\u2014There'll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys'\nschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You\nmay mention my name.\n\u2014Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was\nnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck\ntwice in the junior at the christian brothers.\n\u2014I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.\nCorley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to\ndo with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody\ntart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs\nMaloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but\nM'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over\nin Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person\naddressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he\nhadn't said a word about it.\nThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it\nstill Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he\nknew that Corley's brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was\nhardly deserving of much credence. However _haud ignarus malorum\nmiseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially\nas luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the\nmonth on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of\nfact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream\nof the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley's head that he was\nliving in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful.\nWhereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of\nfinding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a\nbob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get\nsufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his\nchagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the\nresult of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the\nmoment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in\nthat contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse\nin fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough\nsearch though he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly\nremembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did\nhe buy. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in\nthe dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.\n\u2014Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.\nAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him\none of them.\n\u2014Thanks, Corley answered, you're a gentleman. I'll pay you back one",

I'd carry a sandwichboard only\nthe girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three\nweeks, man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the\nCarl Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as\na crossing sweeper.\nSubsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six\nhe got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky\nthat he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's,\nbookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle's back with\nO'Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he\nwas lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and\ndisorderly and refusing to go with the constable.\nMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the\ncobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation\nwatchman's sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,\nwas having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own\nprivate account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same\ntime now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired\ninterlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though\nwhere he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the\nremotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give\npoints to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on\nhis very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally\ntestifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his\nhangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one\npreying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put\nit, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street\nchanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the\noption of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether. In any case he\nhad a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that\nhour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.\nThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his\npractised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the\nblandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he\nsaid, laughingly, Stephen, that is:\n\u2014He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named\nBoylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.\nAt this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr\nBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the\ndirection of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,\nmoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,\nwhereupon he observed evasively:\n\u2014Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it\nhis face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much\ndid you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?\n\u2014Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep",

      "text": "somewhere.\n\u2014Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the\nintelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he\ninvariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according\nto his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he\nwith a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of\nthe question. And even supposing you did you won't get in after what\noccurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I\ndon't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why\ndid you leave your father's house?\n\u2014To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.\n\u2014I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom\ndiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on\nyesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of\nconversation that he had moved.\n\u2014I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.\nWhy?\n\u2014A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects\nthan one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one. He takes great\npride, quite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he\nhasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row\nterminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,\nthat is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred\ntheir third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally\nstation belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,\nwhich they did.\nThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it\nwas, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his\nfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by\nthe ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell\ncocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he\ncould drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings\nthey had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and\nKatey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells\nand charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in\naccordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on\nthe days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or\nsomething like that.\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust\nin that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element,\nDr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your\nshoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all\nprobability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.\nOf course you didn't notice as much as I did. But it wouldn't occasion\nme the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic\nwas put in your drink for some ulterior object.\nHe understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a\nversatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was\nrapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,\nbade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future\nas a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services\nin addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from\ncertain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid\nat Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an\nexceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that\nfrankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be\nat the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or\njealousy, pure and simple.\n\u2014Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking\nyour brains, he ventured to throw out.\nThe guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by\nfriendliness which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of\nfeatures did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the\nproblem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge\nby two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about\nsaw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to\nhimself allowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that\neffect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities\nthough he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both\nends meet.\nAdjacent to the men's public urinal they perceived an icecream car\nround which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were\ngetting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a\nparticularly animated way, there being some little differences between\nthe parties.\n\u2014_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!_\n_\u2014Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi\u00f9..._\n_\u2014Dice lui, per\u00f2!_\n_\u2014Mezzo._\n_\u2014Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_\n_\u2014Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa pi\u00f9..._\nMr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious\nwooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been\nbefore, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few\nhints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat\nFitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual\nfacts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few\nmoments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet\ncorner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous\ncollection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the\ngenus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified\nby conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked\ncuriosity.\n\u2014Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest\nto break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the\nshape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.\nAccordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order\nthese commodities quietly. The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or\nwhatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes\napparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous\nindividual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still\nstared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention\nto the floor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,\nhe having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,\nthough, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his\n_prot\u00e9g\u00e9_ in an audible tone of voice _\u00e0 propos_ of the battle royal in\nthe street which was still raging fast and furious:\n\u2014A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not\nwrite your poetry in that language? _Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious\nand full. _Belladonna. Voglio._\nStephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering\nfrom lassitude generally, replied:\n\u2014To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.\n\u2014Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the\ninward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were\nabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that\nsurrounds it.\nThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ put a\nboiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the\ntable and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.\nAfter which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to\nhave a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. For\nwhich reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he\ndid the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was\ntemporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.\n\u2014Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,\nlike names. Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.\nShakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?\n\u2014Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name\nwas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.\nThe redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded\nStephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely\nby asking:\n\u2014And what might your name be?\nJust in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but\nStephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected\nquarter, answered:\n\u2014Dedalus.\nThe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,\nrather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old\nHollands and water.\n\u2014You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.\n\u2014I've heard of him, Stephen said.\nMr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently\neavesdropping too.\n\u2014He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same\nway and nodding. All Irish.\n\u2014All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.\nAs for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole\nbusiness and he was just asking himself what possible connection when\nthe sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the\nshelter with the remark:\n\u2014I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his\nshoulder. The lefthand dead shot.\nThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his\ngestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.\n\u2014Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.\nCocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.\nHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then\nhe screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the\nnight with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\n\u2014Pom! he then shouted once.\nThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,\nthere being still a further egg.\n\u2014Pom! he shouted twice.\nEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding\nbloodthirstily:\n_\u2014Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,\nNever missed nor he never will._\nA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like\nasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the\nBisley.\n\u2014Beg pardon, the sailor said.\n\u2014Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\n\u2014Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic\ninfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He\ntoured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that\nin Stockholm.\n\u2014Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.\n\u2014Murphy's my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.\nKnow where that is?\n\u2014Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.\n\u2014That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's\nwhere I hails from. I belongs there. That's where I hails from. My\nlittle woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. _For England,\nhome and beauty_. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years\nnow, sailing about.\nMr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming\nto the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a\nrainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a\nnumber of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,\nEnoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember\nCaoc O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way\nof poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.\nNever about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the\nabsentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he\nfinally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent\nhis better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but\nI've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow,\nat the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the\ndeep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the\npublican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and\nonions. No chair for father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on\nher knee, _post mortem_ child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my\ngalloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I\nremain with much love your brokenhearted husband W. B. Murphy.\nThe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one\nof the jarvies with the request:\n\u2014You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?\nThe jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die\nof plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object\nwas passed from hand to hand.\n\u2014Thank you, the sailor said.\nHe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow\nstammers, proceeded:\n\u2014We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster _Rosevean_\nfrom Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this\nafternoon. There's my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.\nIn confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket\nand handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.\n\u2014You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,\nleaning on the counter.\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated\na bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and\nNorth America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage. I\nseen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,\nthe Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever\nscuttled a ship. I seen Russia. _Gospodi pomilyou_. That's how the\nRussians prays.\n\u2014You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.\n\u2014Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer\nthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an\nanchor same as I chew that quid.\nHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his\nteeth, bit ferociously:\n\u2014Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and\nthe livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent\nme.\nHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed\nto be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.",

That boggles 'em. Glass.\nMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the\ncard to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran\nas follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Se\u00f1or A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,\nChile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.\nThough not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the\neggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the\nLazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which\noccasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat) having\ndetected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he\nrepresented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after\nhaving boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the\nfictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some\nsuspicions of our friend's _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in\na way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some\nWednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say\nthat he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was\nat heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had\nconsistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead\nwhich was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work\na pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up\nwith the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it\ndid come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was\nnot so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering\nthe fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there\nand back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone\nand be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose\nliver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route,\nPlymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive\ntour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern\nBabylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,\nabbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing\njust struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze\naround on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a\nconcert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure\nresorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas,\nEastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the\nChannel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly\nremunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or\nlocal ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M'Coy type lend me your valise\nand I'll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star\nIrish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal\nconsort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes\nand Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of\nsuccess, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some\nfellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and\nthus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.\nAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was\nto be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with\nthe times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was\nmooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments\nwith the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete\nfogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly\nwas for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public\nat large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.\nIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no\nsmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the\nsystem really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry\npounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead\nof being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took\nme for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more\nhumdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the\ngrind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at\nher spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.\nThere were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home\nisland, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora\nof attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around\nDublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there\nwas a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in\nWicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood\nfor elderly wheelmen so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds\nof Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d'\u0153il_ was exceedingly\ngrand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that\nthe influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering\nthe signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic\nassociations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV,\nrhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt\nwith all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when\nyoung men's fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off\nthe cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their\nleft leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the\npillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely\nin its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be\ndesired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of\ncuriosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created\nthe route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the\nother side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.\n\u2014I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had\nlittle pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened\nand every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a\nhouse, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly\nadded, the chinks does.\nPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the\nglobetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.\n\u2014And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his\nback. Knife like that.\nWhilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in\nkeeping with his character and held it in the striking position.\n\u2014In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.\nFellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. _Prepare to\nmeet your God_, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.\nHis heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further\nquestions even should they by any chance want to.\n\u2014That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable\n_stiletto_.\nAfter which harrowing _d\u00e9nouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he\nsnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before\nin his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.\n\u2014They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in\nthe dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought\nthe park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account\nof them using knives.\nAt this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is\nbliss_ Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both\ninstinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the\nstrictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,\n_alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid\nfrom his boiler affair. His inscrutable face which was really a work of\nart, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the\nimpression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on.\nFunny, very!\nThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and\nstarts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the\nnatives _choza de_, another the seaman's discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as\nhe was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He\nvividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well\nas yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the\nland troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively",

      "text": "speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was\njust turned fifteen.\n\u2014Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.\nThe request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.\n\u2014Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.\nThe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or\nno.\n\u2014Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he\nhad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences\nbut he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the\nsawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.\n\u2014What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the\nboats?\nOur _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before\nanswering:\n\u2014I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.\nSalt junk all the time.\nTired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not\nlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,\nfell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the\nglobe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,\nit covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly\nwhat it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at\nthe lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a\nsuperannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the\nnot particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at\nit and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone\nsomewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried\nto find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the\nantipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not\nexactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil\nthere was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going\ninto the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that\nthe sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things\nsomebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence\nthough it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that\nsort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery\nand insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for\nthat very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable\ninstitution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland\nor seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like\nthat should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and\ncoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid\nthe elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that\nevery man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the\nwintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to\ncapsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had\nexperienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.\n\u2014There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog,\nhimself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as\ngentleman's valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I've on me\nand he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I'm game for that job,\nshaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There's my son now, Danny,\nrun off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where\nhe could be drawing easy money.\n\u2014What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the\nside, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away\nfrom the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy\ngetup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?\nHe'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it.\nThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow\nshirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was\nto be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent\nan anchor.\n\u2014There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.\nI must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It's them black lads I objects\nto. I hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.\nSeeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged\nhis shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the\nmariner's hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a\nyoung man's sideface looking frowningly rather.\n\u2014Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying\nbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the\nname of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.\n\u2014Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.\nThat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.\nSomeway in his. Squeezing or.\n\u2014See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And\nthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his\nfingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.\nAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did\nactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the\nunreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this\ntime stretched over.\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's gone\ntoo. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.\nHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression\nof before.\n\u2014Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.\n\u2014And what's the number for? loafer number two queried.\n\u2014Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time\nwith some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the\ndirection of the questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.\nAnd then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his\nalleged end:\n\u2014As bad as old Antonio,\nFor he left me on my ownio.\nThe face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat\npeered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on\nher own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom,\nscarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment\nflusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink\nsheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had\nlaid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though\nwhy pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round\nthe door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that\nafternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the\nlane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)\nand begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed\nrather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to\nadmit he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles\nstreet and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled\nwith Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they\nreally loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still\njust then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than\nher company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a\nrude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the _Evening\nTelegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side\nof the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was\nnot exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of\ngazers round skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more\nof her.\n\u2014The gunboat, the keeper said.\n\u2014It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,\nhow a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with\ndisease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober\nsenses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of\ncourse I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.\nStill no matter what the cause is from...\nStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely\nremarking:\n\u2014In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a\nroaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to\nbuy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\nThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a\nprude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be\nput a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart\nfrom any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil,\nwere not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a\nthing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a\nstalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a\npolicy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would\nconfer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.\n\u2014You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe\nin the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,\nas distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I\nbelieve in that myself because it has been explained by competent men\nas the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have\nsuch inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\nThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try\nand concentrate and remember before he could say:\n\u2014They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and\ntherefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for\nthe possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I\ncan hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other\npractical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both\nbeing excluded by court etiquette.\nMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the\nmystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he\nfelt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly\nrejoining:\n\u2014Simple? I shouldn't think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant\nyou, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a\nblue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for\ninstance to invent those rays R\u00f6ntgen did or the telescope like Edison,\nthough I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,\nand the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural\nphenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour\nto say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.\n\u2014O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several\nof the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial\nevidence.\nOn this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they\nwere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference\nin their respective ages, clashed.\n\u2014Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his\noriginal point with a smile of unbelief. I'm not so sure about that.\nThat's a matter for everyman's opinion and, without dragging in the\nsectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_\nthere. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were\ngenuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the\nbig question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them\nlike _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely\nbetter than I, of course I needn't tell you. Can't you drink that\ncoffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It's\nlike one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what\nhe hasn't got. Try a bit.\n\u2014Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the\nmoment refusing to dictate further.\nFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir\nor try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with\nsomething approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance\n(and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond\nyea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they\nwere in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic\nevenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the\nlower orders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful\nrecollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been\nprominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration\nindeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to\nbelieve, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to\nspeak of. Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas\nhe remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he\ncouldn't remember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical\ninspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary\nwhich possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on\naccount of the medical analysis involved.\n\u2014Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being\nstirred.\nThus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug\nfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and\ntook a sip of the offending beverage.\n\u2014Still it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid\nfood, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but\nregular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental\nor manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different\nman.\n\u2014Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that\nknife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\nMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated\narticle, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly\nRoman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was\nthe least conspicuous point about it.\n\u2014Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of\nknives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_. Do you think they are\ngenuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and\nlie like old boots. Look at him.\nYet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was\nfull of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it\nwas quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire\nfabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent\nprobability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly\naccurate gospel.\nHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and\nSherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a\nwellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,\nthere was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a\njail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to\nassociate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill\nfraternity. He might even have done for his man supposing it was his\nown case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he\nkilled him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in\ndurance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to\nthe dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our\nnational poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above\ndescribed. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable\nweakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like\nthose jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner\nwho sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner\n_Hesperus_ and etcetera. And when all was said and done the lies a\nfellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to\nthe wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.\n\u2014Mind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed.\nAnalogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants,\nthough that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the\nmidget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some\nAztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn't straighten\ntheir legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he\nproceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews\nor whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly\npowerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as\ngods. There's an example again of simple souls.\nHowever reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who\nreminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the\nboards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the\nmanagement in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host\nof admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him\nthough ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually\nfell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically\nincompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the\nback touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he\nwas none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the\nfish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in\nlittle Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking\nfellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless\nnecessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to\nhave a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or\nher next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\n\u2014Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like\nthat, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own\nhands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they\ncarry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.\nMy wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could\nactually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in\n(technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite\ndark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate\naccounts for character. That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry\nin Italian.\n\u2014The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very\npassionate about ten shillings. _Roberto ruba roba sua_.\n\u2014Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.\n\u2014Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown\nlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles\ntriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san\nTommaso Mastino.\n\u2014It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the\nblood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare\nstreet museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,\nand I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid\nproportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind\nof women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a\nway you find but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides\nthey have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly\nenhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled\nstockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it's a\nthing I simply hate to see.\nInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the\nothers got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,\ncollisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course\nhad his own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and\nweathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all\nthose perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him\nor words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.\nSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt's rock, wreck\nof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for\nthe moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry\nCampbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand. That was the talk\nof the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of\noriginal verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish\n_Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore\nin commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about\nthe case of the s. s. _Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_\nwhich was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with\nall hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the _Mona_'s, said he\nwas afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it\nappears, in her hold.\nAt this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him\nto unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.\n\u2014Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just\ngently dropping off into a peaceful doze.\nHe made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,\nstepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore\ndue left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who\nnoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's\nrum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his\nburning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew\nand, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig\nout of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had\na shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a man\u0153uvre after the\ncounterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared\nto all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when\nduly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and\ngirders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was\nall radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some\nperson or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by\nthe cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a\nbrief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor,\nevidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the\nnoise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the\nground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped\nanyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly\ndisturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of\nthe corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking\nup, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now\npractically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin\nin all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before\nshifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again\nin to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its\nmost virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and\nfamiliarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a\ncool \u00a3 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass\nproceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the\nend of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink\nwithout a beggarly stiver. He drank needless to be told and it pointed\nonly once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of\nbusiness if\u2014a big if, however\u2014he had contrived to cure himself of his\nparticular partiality.\nAll meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,\ncoastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the\nsame thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra\nbasin, the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there\nonly no ships ever called.\nThere were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au\nfait_.\nWhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only\nrock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr\nWorthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he\nadvised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that\nday's work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.\n\u2014Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his\nprivate potation and the rest of his exertions.\nThat worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words\ngrowled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or\nother in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then\nexpectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have\nlodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and\nmaking water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in\nquestion. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful\nlibation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the\n_soir\u00e9e_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:\n\u2014The biscuits was as hard as brass\nAnd the beef as salt as Lot's wife's arse.\nO, Johnny Lever!\nJohnny Lever, O!\nAfter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene\nand regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form\nprovided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to\ngrind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent\nthe natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he\ndescribed in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none\non the face of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal\nin large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every\nyear, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained\nout of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through\nthe nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot\nmore surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly\nbecame general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any\nmortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel\nEverard down there in Navan growing tobacco. Where would you find\nanywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated\n_crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the\nconversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of\npelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest\nfall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their\nlittle lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end.\nBrummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be\nIreland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the\nvulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at\nonce seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the\ntendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay\nin the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.\nIreland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.",

      "text": "Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_. The\nimpervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.\n\u2014Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a\nbit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.\nTo which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper\nconcurred but nevertheless held to his main view.\n\u2014Who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately\ninterrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals\nand generals we've got? Tell me that.\n\u2014The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial\nblemishes apart.\n\u2014That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic\npeasant. He's the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?\nWhile allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added\nhe cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no\nIrishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a\nfew irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say,\nappealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with\ninterest so long as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to\nblows.\nFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was\nrather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,\npending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he\nwas fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the\nchannel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for,\nrather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a\npar with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred\nmillion years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out\nand if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all\nhe could personally say on the matter was that as a host of\ncontingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it\nwas highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both\ncountries even though poles apart. Another little interesting point,\nthe amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance,\nreminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against\nher, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of\nthem, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris,\nthe famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him\nforcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing,\nthat is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human\nsoul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the\nlessee or keeper, who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (B.)\ncouldn't help feeling and most properly it was better to give people\nlike that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and\nrefuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private\nlife and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a\nDannyman coming forward and turning queen's evidence or king's now like\nDenis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from\nthat he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.\nYet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his\nbosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it\n(while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for\na man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage\nof his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a\nparty to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of\nthe south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently,\nafter some words passed between the two concerning her relations with\nthe other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted\nfatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative\npostnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just\nstruck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for\nthe actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was\nreliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of\nfact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case\nthat was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo\nSkin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought\nto have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses,\nalways farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.\nGenerous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any\nidea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So\nsimilarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid\nof some \u00a3. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in\nthe congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin\nand so on. Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the\nsame identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually\nsilenced the offender.\n\u2014He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the\nwhole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and\nin a heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain\nfacts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and\nall his family like me though in reality I'm not. That was one for him.\nA soft answer turns away wrath. He hadn't a word to say for himself as\neveryone saw. Am I not right?\nHe turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride\nat the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to\nglean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly.\n\u2014_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or\nfour eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any\nother, _secundum carnem_.\n\u2014Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides\nof the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to\nright and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is\nthough every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the\ngovernment it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It's all\nvery fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual\nequality. I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. It\nnever reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the\ndue instalments plan. It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate\npeople because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,\nin the next house so to speak.\n\u2014Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen\nassented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market.\nYes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that\nwas overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of\nthing.\n\u2014You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of\nconflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely...\nAll those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad\nblood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,\nerroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were\nvery largely a question of the money question which was at the back of\neverything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.\n\u2014They accuse, remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, who\nprobably\u2026 and spoke nearer to, so as the others\u2026 in case they\u2026\n\u2014Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of\nruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would\nyou be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the\ninquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,\nan uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer\nfor, imported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper\nspirit. They are practical and are proved to be so. I don't want to\nindulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and\nthen orthodox as you are. But in the economic, not touching religion,\ndomain the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war,\ncompared with goahead America. Turks. It's in the dogma. Because if\nthey didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die they'd\ntry to live better, at least so I think. That's the juggle on which the\np.p.'s raise the wind on false pretences. I'm, he resumed with dramatic\nforce, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the\noutset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes\n_pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion\neither, something in the neighbourhood of \u00a3 300 per annum. That's the\nvital issue at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of\nfriendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that's my idea for\nwhat it's worth. I call that patriotism. _Ubi patria_, as we learned a\nsmattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_. Where\nyou can live well, the sense is, if you work.\nOver his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this\nsynopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.\nHe could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those\ncrabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours\nof different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere\nbeneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or\ndidn't say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.\n\u2014Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.\nThe eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person\nwho owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all\nmust work, have to, together.\n\u2014I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest\npossible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the\nthing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel\nnowadays. That's work too. Important work. After all, from the little I\nknow of you, after all the money expended on your education you are\nentitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit\nas much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the\npeasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.\nEach is equally important.\n\u2014You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may\nbe important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called\nIreland for short.\n\u2014I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.\n\u2014But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important\nbecause it belongs to me.\n\u2014What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under\nsome misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the\nlatter portion. What was it you...?\nStephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of\ncoffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:\n\u2014We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.\nAt this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked\ndown but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction\nto put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some\nkind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of his\nrecent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way\nforeign to his sober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B\nattached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he\nhadn't been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of\nfear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an\nair of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,\nthe eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,\nfailing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind\ninstances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in\nthe bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For\ninstance there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy\nfaddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad\nvagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a\nnuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously\nsporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual\n_d\u00e9nouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed\ninto hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a\nstrong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so\nas not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law\namendment act, certain names of those subp\u0153naed being handed in but not\ndivulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.\nBriefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly\nturned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and\nthe tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in\nthe house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne,\nthen heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high\npersonages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state,\nhe reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running\ncounter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before\nunder their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good\nMrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the\nreason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women\nchiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being\nlargely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like\ndistinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must,\ntrying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of\na genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned\nhis and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the\ncannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a\ncontinental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the\nother hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest\nrung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius,\nthat. With brains, sir.\nFor which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even\nto wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could\nnot exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad\nhaving in fact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the\nacquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food\nfor reflection would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation,\nas such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the\nmind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance,\nrow, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers,\nthe whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of\nthe world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth,\nviz. coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the\nmicroscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he\nmight meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy\nif taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the\ncommon groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea\nper column. _My Experiences_, let us say, _in a Cabman's Shelter_.\nThe pink edition extra sporting of the _Telegraph_ tell a graphic lie\nlay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just\npuzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and\nthe preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard\nwas addressed A.

Thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral\nof the late Mr Patrick Dignam.\nSo to change the subject he read about Dignam R. I. P. which, he\nreflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. Or a change of address\nanyway.\n\u2014_This morning_ (Hynes put it in of course) _the remains of the late Mr\nPatrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue,\nSandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a\nmost popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a\nbrief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom\nhe is deeply regretted.

Though\nthat halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get\nleft. Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing\nthough as the event turned out the poor fool hadn't much reason to\ncongratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it\nreduced itself to eventually.\n\u2014There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.\n\u2014Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.\nOne morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:\n_Return of Parnell_. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was\nin that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it\nwas killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for\na time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with\nno-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone\ndown on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his\nsenses. Dead he wasn't. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they\nbrought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the\nBoer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and\nso on.\nAll the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their\nmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and\nnot singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it\nwas twenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow\nof truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly\ninadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in\nhis death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just\nwhen his various different political arrangements were nearing\ncompletion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having\nneglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold\nresulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his\nroom till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a\nfortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find\nthe job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted\nwith his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his\nwhereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order\neven prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and\nStewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within\nthe bounds of possibility. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as\na born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure,\na sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged\nfeet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren't even a patch on\nthe former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were\nvery few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with\nfeet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on\nhim with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You\nhad to come back. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the\nunderstudy in the title _r\u00f4le_ how to. He saw him once on the\nauspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_\nor was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in\npoint of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he\nsaid _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid\nexterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the\ncup and the lip: what's bred in the bone. Still as regards return. You\nwere a lucky dog if they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got\nback. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and\nHarry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in\npossession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the\nTichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat's name to\nthe best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence\nwent to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew\nwas it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some\npal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description\ngiven, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or\nsome such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to\nthe not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under\ndiscussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land\nfirst.\n\u2014That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor\ncommented. She put the first nail in his coffin.\n\u2014Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry\nCampbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man's thighs.\nI seen her picture in a barber's. The husband was a captain or an\nofficer.\n\u2014Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.\nThis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair\namount of laughter among his _entourage_. As regards Bloom he, without\nthe faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the\ndoor and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused\nextraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters\nworse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed\nbetween them full of sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic\ntill nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till\nbit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of\nthe town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not\na few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his\ndownfall though the thing was public property all along though not to\nanything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed\ninto. Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared\nfavourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the\nrank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared\nher bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went\nthrough the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape\nof witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a\nparticular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment\nwith the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained\nadmittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the\nlubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the\nsimple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not\nbeing up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the\nname, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of\nweakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home\nties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's smiles. The eternal\nquestion of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real\nlove, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist\nbetween married folk? Poser. Though it was no concern of theirs\nabsolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of\nfolly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented\nobviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military\nsupernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my\ngallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th\nhussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,\nthat is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,\nwoman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame\nwhich he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the\ngospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved\nevicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts\nof the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that\nexceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his\nmatrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in\nthe same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking back now in a\nretrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. And then\ncoming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without\nsaying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the\ntimes. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not\nbeen in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as\nit happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south,\nhowever, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and\nsimple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the\nvery thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that\nwouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting\nevery shred of decency to the winds.\n\u2014Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to\nStephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don't greatly mistake she\nwas Spanish too.\n\u2014The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or\nother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and\nthe first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and\nso many.\n\u2014Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any\nmeans, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it\nwas as she lived there. So, Spain.\nCarefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him\nby the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out\nhis pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained\nrapidly finally he.\n\u2014Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded\nphoto which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?\nStephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large\nsized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she\nwas in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously\nlow for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than\nvision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth,\nstanding near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which\nwas _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all\nthe vogue. Her (the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about\nto smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland\nstreet, Dublin's premier photographic artist, being responsible for the\nesthetic execution.\n\u2014Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom\nindicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like\nher then.\nBeside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his\nlegal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major\nBrian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a\nsinger having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered\nbarely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in\nexpression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a\nlot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage\nin that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for\nthe ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt,\nbeing a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in\ngeneral developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that\nafternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as\nworks of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original,\nshoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it\ndoes though, Saint Joseph's sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne\ntoi trop. Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn't art in a\nword.\nThe spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's\ngood example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to\nspeak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the\nbeauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in\nitself which the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was\nscarcely professional etiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort\nof a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for\nsunshine after storm. And he did feel a kind of need there and then to\nfollow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by\nmoving a motion. Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly\nsoiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear\nhowever, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further\nincreasing the other's possible embarrassment while gauging her\nsymmetry of heaving _embonpoint_. In fact the slight soiling was only\nan added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new,\nmuch better in fact with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he?\nI looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely\nas a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning\nlittered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses\n(_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately\nbeside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.\nThe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,\n_distingu\u00e9_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of\nthe bunch though you wouldn't think he had it in him yet you would.\nBesides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it\nwas though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An\nawful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a\nlifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same\nold matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or\nthe newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about\nthe whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment\nsprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the\npublic eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy\nand compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they\nopenly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside\nhotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in\ndue course intimate. Then the decree _nisi_ and the King's proctor\ntries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made\nabsolute. But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they\nlargely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they\nvery largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor\nwho filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, B,\nenjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin's uncrowned king in the\nflesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen\nleader's, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when\nclothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader's) trusty henchmen to the\nnumber of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated\ninto the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United\nIreland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up\nthe typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of\nsome scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O'Brienite\nscribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile\ntribune's private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man he\nwas still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with\nthat look of settled purpose which went a long way with the\nshillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that\ntheir idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which\nshe, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot\ntimes in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a\nnasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated\nlodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a\ngrave character. His hat (Parnell's) a silk one was inadvertently\nknocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who\npicked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to\nreturn it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity)\nwho panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat\nat the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the\ncountry he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos\nof the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone instilled into\nhim in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good\nform was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and\nthanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in\na very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal\nprofession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the\ncourse of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after\nthe burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory\nafter the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\nOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes\nof the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing\nimmoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the\nwherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case\nfor the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate\nhusband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter\nfrom the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the\ncrucial moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms,\ndrawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a\ndomestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord\nand master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not\nreceive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would\noverlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes\nthough possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as\nquite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a\nsceptical bias, believed and didn't make the smallest bones about\nsaying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging\naround on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the\nbest wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the\nsake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of\nwedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to\npress their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being\nthat her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_\nbetween still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty\nand younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine\ninfatuation proved up to the hilt.\nIt was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of\nbrains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time\nwith profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last\nhim his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day\ntake unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the\ninterim ladies' society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the\ngravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump\nStephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular\nlodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as\nto whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl\ncourtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to\ntheir names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of\ncomplimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and\nflowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some\nlandlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The\nqueer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who\nwas several years the other's senior or like his father but something\nsubstantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made\non unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty\nDumpty boiled.\n\u2014At what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired\nthough unwrinkled face.\n\u2014Some time yesterday, Stephen said.\n\u2014Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow\nFriday. Ah, you mean it's after twelve!\n\u2014The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.\nLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.\nThough they didn't see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there\nsomehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the\none train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some\nscore of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to\nparliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in\nretrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a\nsneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the\nevicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely\nin people's mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a\ncopper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which\nwouldn't exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all\nevents was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the\ntrend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his\nmistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted\nwith going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he\nat one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he\nstrongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion\nby our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that\nhe, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of\nmortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him\n(metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics\nthemselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties\ninvariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity\nand the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on\nfine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\nAnyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it\nwas, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was\na bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue\n(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash\naltogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed\nunknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or\nthe reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he\nvery distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the\nother hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount\nor Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which\nof the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved\nhim to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things\nconsidered. His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or\nnot over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn't\nwhat you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried\nhim was he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,\nsupposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very\ngreat personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in\nhis way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up\nby concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of\nEpps's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two\nand overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands\nand as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast\namount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort\nwas kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the\ngrasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't\nappear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly\nbeloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse\nof retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would\nbe the best clue to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few\ndays to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with\nsixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to\nfreeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized\ncharms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment\nof large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for\nas to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as\nMr Algebra remarks _passim_. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over\nhis gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being\na jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what\nproperly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point\ntoo of tender Achilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they\nappeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts\nin the county Sligo.\n\u2014I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while\nprudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here you just come\nhome with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the\nvicinity. You can't drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I'll\njust pay this lot.\nThe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain\nsailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the\nkeeper of the shanty who didn't seem to.\n\u2014Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of\nthat Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.\nAll kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B's) busy brain,\neducation (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,\nup to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed\nwith hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian\nwith the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other\nthings, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from\nthe housetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was\nwanted. Because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to\nbank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be\njust as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the\ndirection of that particular red herring just to.\nThe cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former\nviceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association\ndinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this\nthrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who\nappeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony\nMacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to\nthat effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered\nwhy.\n\u2014Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner\nput in, manifesting some natural impatience.\n\u2014And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.\nThe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles\nwhich he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.\n\u2014Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk\nqueried.\n\u2014Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a\nbit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen\nportholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.\nSand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the\ndark, manner of speaking. _The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my\nfavourite and _Red as a Rose is She._\nHereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,\nfound drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a\nhundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which\ntime (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied\nloosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched\nhim as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were\nsufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,\nthat is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial\nremark.\nTo cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first\nto rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first\nand foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for\nthe occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine\nhost as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were\nnot looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a\ngrand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four\ncoppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously\nspotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him\nin unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well\nworth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.\n\u2014Come, he counselled to close the _s\u00e9ance_.\nSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the\nshelter or shanty together and the _\u00e9lite_ society of oilskin and\ncompany whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their\n_dolce far niente_. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and\nfagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.\n\u2014One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of\nthe moment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs\nupside down, on the tables in caf\u00e9s. To which impromptu the\nneverfailing Bloom replied without a moment's hesitation, saying\nstraight off:\n\u2014To sweep the floor in the morning.\nSo saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same\ntime apologetic to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the\nbye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The\nnight air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit\nweak on his pins.\n\u2014It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a\nmoment. The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man.\nCome. It's not far. Lean on me.\nAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on\naccordingly.\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange\nkind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and\nall that.\nAnyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the\nmunicipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and\npurposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming\nof fresh fields and pastures new. And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the\nanalogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the\npart of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the\ntime of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the\nselfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\nSo they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which\nBloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made\ntracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though\nconfessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to\nfollow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's _Huguenots_,\nMeyerbeer's _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart's _Twelfth Mass_\nhe simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the\nacme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else\ninto a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the\ncatholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line\nsuch as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live\nthy protestant to be_. He also yielded to none in his admiration of\nRossini's _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,\nin which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable\nsensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and\nputting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers' church\nin upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the\ndoors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather. There was the\nunanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it\nto say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was\na generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring\npreferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,\na gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface\nknowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And\ntalking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old\nfavourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel's air in _Martha,\nM'appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be\nmore accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from\nthe lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of\nthe number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.\nStephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn't sing it but\nlaunched out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or\nabout that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near\nGerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an\ninstrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch,\nwhom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded\nfamiliar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_\nand _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he\nsaid, in the Queen's chapel or anywhere else he found them and one\nTomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.\nOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond\nthe swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,\nbrushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not\nperfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to\nsixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the\npolitical celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical\nnames, as a striking coincidence.\nBy the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,\nBloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other's\nsleeve gently, jocosely remarking:\n\u2014Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\nThey thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth\nanything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite\nnear so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even\nflesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a\nblackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot\nforemost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with\nhis thoughts. But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn't a lump\nof sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared\nfor every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big nervous\nfoolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But\neven a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the\nsame size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal's fault\nin particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the\ndesert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them\nall could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring\nthe bees. Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of\nhis back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my\neagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field\noccupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen's words while the\nship of the street was man\u0153uvring and Stephen went on about the highly\ninteresting old.\n\u2014What's this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in\nmedias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your\nacquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\nHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,\nimage of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome\nblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after\nas he was perhaps not that way built.\nStill, supposing he had his father's gift as he more than suspected, it\nopened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall's Irish\nindustries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in\ngeneral.\nExquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has\nEnd_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows\ncome from. Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_\nabout the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,\nwhich boggled Bloom a bit:\nVon der Sirenen Listigkeit\nTun die Poeten dichten.\nThese opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_. Bloom, nodding,\nsaid he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which\nhe did.\nA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,\nwhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could\neasily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice\nproduction such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the\nbargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and\nprocure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entr\u00e9e_ into\nfashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial\nmagnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his\nuniversity degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly\nbearing to all the more influence the good impression he would\ninfallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which\nalso could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his\nclothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into\ntheir good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society's sartorial\nniceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate\nagainst you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily\nforesee him participating in their musical and artistic\n_conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for\nchoice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and\nbeing made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he\nhappened to know, were on record\u2014in fact, without giving the show away,\nhe himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added\nto which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be\nsneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he\nparenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily\nembrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of\ntime. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and\nboth monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity\nin the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a\ncheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though\ntaste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,\ndifferent from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue\nas it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical world after the\nusual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public\nby Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_. Yes,\nbeyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and\nhe had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high\nplace in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and,\nbooking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street\nhouse, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs,\nso to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort\nto obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too\nmuch f\u00eated prince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the\nother by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time\nto practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing\nwithout its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything\nderogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he\nhad the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other,\npossessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort,\nhung on to him at all.\nThe horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he\npurposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on\nthe _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his\nconnection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was\nprone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious\npretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call\nit which in Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side\nof a person's character, no pun intended.\nThe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted\nand, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting\nfall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three\nsmoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a\nfull crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she)\nhad ended, patient in his scythed car.\nSide by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed\nthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping\nover a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,\nStephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.\nUnd alle Schiffe br\u00fccken.\nThe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,\none full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by\nFather Maher_. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again\ncontinuing their _t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate_ (which, of course, he was utterly out\nof) about sirens, enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of\nother topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the\nkind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in\nthe sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they\nwere too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner",

Both preferred a continental to an insular manner\nof life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both\nindurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of\nheterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox\nreligious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the\nalternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual\nmagnetism.\nWere their views on some points divergent?\nStephen dissented openly from Bloom's views on the importance of\ndietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's\nviews on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.\nBloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism\ninvolved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to\nchristianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,\nson of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign\nof Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt\n(\u2020 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty\nand interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric\ninanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of\nadulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and\nthe velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen\nattributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both\nfrom two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first\nno bigger than a woman's hand.\nWas there one point on which their views were equal and negative?\nThe influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining\nparaheliotropic trees.\nHad Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in\nthe past?\nIn 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public\nthoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and\nLeonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield\navenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the\nwall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of\nUppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and\nprospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class\nrailway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major\nBrian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and\nseparately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once\nin 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both\noccasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street,\nwest.\nWhat reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,\n1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at\ntheir destination?",
