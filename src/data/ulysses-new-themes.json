He held the bowl aloft and intoned:\n\u2014_Introibo ad altare Dei_.\nHalted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:\n\u2014Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!\nSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about\nand blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the\nawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent\ntowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat\nand shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned\nhis arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking\ngurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light\nuntonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.\nBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the\nbowl smartly.\n\u2014Back to barracks! he said sternly.\nHe added in a preacher's tone:\n\u2014For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul\nand blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One\nmoment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.\nHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused\nawhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and\nthere with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles\nanswered through the calm.\n\u2014Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off\nthe current, will you?\nHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering\nabout his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and\nsullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.\nA pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.\n\u2014The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!\nHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,\nlaughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily\nhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as\nhe propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and\nlathered cheeks and neck.\nBuck Mulligan's gay voice went on.\n\u2014My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a\nHellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We\nmust go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out\ntwenty quid?\nHe laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:\n\u2014Will he come? The jejune jesuit!\nCeasing, he began to shave with care.\n\u2014Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.\n\u2014Yes, my love?\n\u2014How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?\nBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.\n\u2014God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks\nyou're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money\nand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you\nhave the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you\nis the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.\nHe shaved warily over his chin.\n\u2014He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is\nhis guncase?\n\u2014A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?\n\u2014I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark\nwith a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a\nblack panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If\nhe stays on here I am off.\nBuck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down\nfrom his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.\n\u2014Scutter! he cried thickly.\nHe came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper\npocket, said:\n\u2014Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.\nStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a\ndirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.\nThen, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:\n\u2014The bard's noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.\nYou can almost taste it, can't you?\nHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair\noakpale hair stirring slightly.\n\u2014God! he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet\nmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa\nponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them\nin the original. _Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.\nCome and look.\nStephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked\ndown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of\nKingstown.\n\u2014Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.\nHe turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's\nface.\n\u2014The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't\nlet me have anything to do with you.\n\u2014Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.\n\u2014You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother\nasked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to\nthink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and\npray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....\nHe broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant\nsmile curled his lips.\n\u2014But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest\nmummer of them all!\nHe shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.\nStephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against\nhis brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.\nPain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently,\nin a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within\nits loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,\nher breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of\nwetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a\ngreat sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and\nskyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had\nstood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had\ntorn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.\nBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.\n\u2014Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt\nand a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?\n\u2014They fit well enough, Stephen answered.\nBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.\n\u2014The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God\nknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair\nstripe, grey. You'll look spiffing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch. You\nlook damn well when you're dressed.\n\u2014Thanks, Stephen said. I can't wear them if they are grey.\n\u2014He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.\nEtiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can't wear grey\ntrousers.\nHe folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the\nsmooth skin.\nStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its\nsmokeblue mobile eyes.\n\u2014That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,\nsays you have g. p. i. He's up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.\nGeneral paralysis of the insane!\nHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings\nabroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips\nlaughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized\nall his strong wellknit trunk.\n\u2014Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!\nStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by\na crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this\nface for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.\n\u2014I pinched it out of the skivvy's room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her\nall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.\nLead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.\nLaughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes.\n\u2014The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If\nWilde were only alive to see you!\nDrawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:\n\u2014It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.\nBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him\nround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he\nhad thrust them.\n\u2014It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.\nGod knows you have more spirit than any of them.\nParried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The\ncold steel pen.\n\u2014Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap\ndownstairs and touch him for a guinea. He's stinking with money and\nthinks you're not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling\njalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and\nI could only work together we might do something for the island.\nHellenise it.\nCranly's arm. His arm.\n\u2014And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I'm the only one\nthat knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more? What have you up\nyour nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I'll\nbring down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave\nClive Kempthorpe.\nYoung shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. Palefaces:\nthey hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall\nexpire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit\nribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the\ntable, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the\ntailor's shears. A scared calf's face gilded with marmalade. I don't\nwant to be debagged! Don't you play the giddy ox with me!\nShouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf\ngardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower\non the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.\nTo ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.\n\u2014Let him stay, Stephen said. There's nothing wrong with him except at\nnight.\n\u2014Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I'm\nquite frank with you. What have you against me now?\nThey halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on\nthe water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm\nquietly.\n\u2014Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.\n\u2014Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don't remember anything.\nHe looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,\nfanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of\nanxiety in his eyes.\nStephen, depressed by his own voice, said:\n\u2014Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother's\ndeath?\nBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:\n\u2014What? Where? I can't remember anything. I remember only ideas and\nsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?\n\u2014You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get\nmore hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the\ndrawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.\n\u2014Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.\n\u2014You said, Stephen answered, _O, it's only Dedalus whose mother is\nbeastly dead._\nA flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck\nMulligan's cheek.\n\u2014Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?\nHe shook his constraint from him nervously.\n\u2014And what is death, he asked, your mother's or yours or my own? You saw\nonly your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and\nRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It's a beastly\nthing and nothing else. It simply doesn't matter. You wouldn't kneel\ndown to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?\nBecause you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected\nthe wrong way. To me it's all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes\nare not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks\nbuttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it's over. You crossed her\nlast wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don't whinge like\nsome hired mute from Lalouette's. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I\ndidn't mean to offend the memory of your mother.\nHe had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping\nwounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:\n\u2014I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.\n\u2014Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.\n\u2014Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.\nBuck Mulligan swung round on his heel.\n\u2014O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.\nHe walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,\ngazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now\ngrew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he\nfelt the fever of his cheeks.\nA voice within the tower called loudly:\n\u2014Are you up there, Mulligan?\n\u2014I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered.\nHe turned towards Stephen and said:\n\u2014Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,\nKinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.\nHis head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level\nwith the roof:\n\u2014Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the\nmoody brooding.\nHis head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of\nthe stairhead:\nAnd no more turn aside and brood",

            "text": "Upon love's bitter mystery\nFor Fergus rules the brazen cars.\nWoodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the\nstairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of\nwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the\ndim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the\nharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words\nshimmering on the dim tide.\nA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in\ndeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus'\nsong: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.\nHer door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and\npity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For\nthose words, Stephen: love's bitter mystery.\nWhere now?\nHer secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,\na gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the\nsunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing\nin the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he\nsang:\nI am the boy\nThat can enjoy\nInvisibility.\nPhantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.\nAnd no more turn aside and brood.\nFolded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his\nbrooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had\napproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,\nroasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely\nfingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's\nshirts.\nIn a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its\nloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,\nbent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.\nHer glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On\nme alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the\ntortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all\nprayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata\nrutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum\nchorus excipiat._\nGhoul! Chewer of corpses!\nNo, mother! Let me be and let me live.\n\u2014Kinch ahoy!\nBuck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the\nstaircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry,\nheard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.\n\u2014Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is\napologising for waking us last night. It's all right.\n\u2014I'm coming, Stephen said, turning.\n\u2014Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our\nsakes.\nHis head disappeared and reappeared.\n\u2014I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it's very clever. Touch\nhim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.\n\u2014I get paid this morning, Stephen said.\n\u2014The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.\n\u2014If you want it, Stephen said.\n\u2014Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We'll have\na glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent\nsovereigns.\nHe flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of\ntune with a Cockney accent:\nO, won't we have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\nOn coronation,\nCoronation day!\nO, won't we have a merry time\nOn coronation day!\nWarm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,\nforgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it\nthere all day, forgotten friendship?\nHe went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,\nsmelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.\nSo I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now\nand yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.\nIn the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form\nmoved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its\nyellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor\nfrom the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of\ncoalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.\n\u2014We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?\nStephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the\nhammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open\nthe inner doors.\n\u2014Have you the key? a voice asked.\n\u2014Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I'm choked!\nHe howled, without looking up from the fire:\n\u2014Kinch!\n\u2014It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.\nThe key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been\nset ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the\ndoorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and\nsat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside\nhim. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set\nthem down heavily and sighed with relief.\n\u2014I'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a\nword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.\nHaines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy\ngifts. Where's the sugar? O, jay, there's no milk.\nStephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from\nthe locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.\n\u2014What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.\n\u2014We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There's a lemon in the\nlocker.\n\u2014O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove\nmilk.\nHaines came in from the doorway and said quietly:\n\u2014That woman is coming up with the milk.\n\u2014The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his\nchair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,\nI can't go fumbling at the damned eggs.\nHe hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three\nplates, saying:\n\u2014_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._\nHaines sat down to pour out the tea.\n\u2014I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do\nmake strong tea, don't you?\nBuck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old\nwoman's wheedling voice:\n\u2014When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I\nmakes water I makes water.\n\u2014By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.\nBuck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:\n\u2014_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma'am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God\nsend you don't make them in the one pot._\nHe lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled\non his knife.\n\u2014That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines\nof text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of\nDundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.\nHe turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his\nbrows:\n\u2014Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken\nof in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?\n\u2014I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.\n\u2014Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?\n\u2014I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the\nMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.\nBuck Mulligan's face smiled with delight.\n\u2014Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth\nand blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!\nThen, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened\nrasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:\n_\u2014For old Mary Ann\nShe doesn't care a damn.\nBut, hising up her petticoats..._\nHe crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.\nThe doorway was darkened by an entering form.\n\u2014The milk, sir!\n\u2014Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.\nAn old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow.\n\u2014That's a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.\n\u2014To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!\nStephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.\n\u2014The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of\nthe collector of prepuces.\n\u2014How much, sir? asked the old woman.\n\u2014A quart, Stephen said.\nHe watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white\nmilk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a\ntilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a\nmessenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.\nCrouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on\nher toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They\nlowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and\npoor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly\nform of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their\ncommon cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to\nupbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.\n\u2014It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.\n\u2014Taste it, sir, she said.\nHe drank at her bidding.\n\u2014If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat\nloudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten\nguts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved\nwith dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits.\n\u2014Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.\n\u2014I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan answered.\n\u2014Look at that now, she said.\nStephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice\nthat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she\nslights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there\nis of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in\nGod's likeness, the serpent's prey. And to the loud voice that now bids\nher be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.\n\u2014Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.\n\u2014Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.\nHaines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.\n\u2014Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?\n\u2014I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the\nwest, sir?\n\u2014I am an Englishman, Haines answered.\n\u2014He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak\nIrish in Ireland.\n\u2014Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak\nthe language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows.\n\u2014Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill\nus out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma'am?\n\u2014No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the\nmilkcan on her forearm and about to go.\nHaines said to her:\n\u2014Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?\nStephen filled again the three cups.\n\u2014Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it's seven mornings a pint at\ntwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three\nmornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That's a\nshilling and one and two is two and two, sir.\nBuck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly\nbuttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search\nhis trouser pockets.\n\u2014Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.\nStephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the\nthick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in\nhis fingers and cried:\n\u2014A miracle!\nHe passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:\n\u2014Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.\nStephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.\n\u2014We'll owe twopence, he said.\n\u2014Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good\nmorning, sir.\nShe curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant:\n_\u2014Heart of my heart, were it more,\nMore would be laid at your feet._\nHe turned to Stephen and said:\n\u2014Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring\nus back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland\nexpects that every man this day will do his duty.\n\u2014That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your\nnational library today.\n\u2014Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.\nHe turned to Stephen and asked blandly:\n\u2014Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?\nThen he said to Haines:\n\u2014The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.\n\u2014All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey\ntrickle over a slice of the loaf.\nHaines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the\nloose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:\n\u2014I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.\nSpeaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.\nConscience. Yet here's a spot.\n\u2014That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol\nof Irish art is deuced good.\nBuck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and said with\nwarmth of tone:\n\u2014Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.\n\u2014Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just\nthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.\n\u2014Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.\nHaines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of\nthe hammock, said:\n\u2014I don't know, I'm sure.\nHe strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen\nand said with coarse vigour:\n\u2014You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?\n\u2014Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the\nmilkwoman or from him. It's a toss up, I think.\n\u2014I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along\nwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.\n\u2014I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.\nBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm.\n\u2014From me, Kinch, he said.\nIn a suddenly changed tone he added:\n\u2014To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. Damn all else they\nare good for. Why don't you play them as I do? To hell with them all.\nLet us get out of the kip.\nHe stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying\nresignedly:\n\u2014Mulligan is stripped of his garments.\nHe emptied his pockets on to the table.\n\u2014There's your snotrag, he said.\nAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,\nchiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and\nrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,\nwe'll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green\nboots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I\ncontradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of\nhis talking hands.\n\u2014And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said.\nStephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the\ndoorway:\n\u2014Are you coming, you fellows?\n\u2014I'm ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,\nKinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out\nwith grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:\n\u2014And going forth he met Butterly.\nStephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out\nand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and\nlocked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.\nAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:\n\u2014Did you bring the key?\n\u2014I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.\nHe walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy\nbathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.\n\u2014Down, sir! How dare you, sir!\nHaines asked:\n\u2014Do you pay rent for this tower?\n\u2014Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.\n\u2014To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.\nThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:\n\u2014Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?\n\u2014Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on\nthe sea. But ours is the _omphalos_.\n\u2014What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.\n\u2014No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas\nand the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I\nhave a few pints in me first.\nHe turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his\nprimrose waistcoat:\n\u2014You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?\n\u2014It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.\n\u2014You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?\n\u2014Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.\nIt's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is\nShakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own\nfather.\n\u2014What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?\nBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in\nloose laughter, said to Stephen's ear:\n\u2014O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!\n\u2014We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is\nrather long to tell.\nBuck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.\n\u2014The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.\n\u2014I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this\ntower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That\nbeetles o'er his base into the sea,_ isn't it?\nBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did\nnot speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in\ncheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.\n\u2014It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.\nEyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.\nThe seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the\nsmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail\ntacking by the Muglins.\n\u2014I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.\nThe Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the\nFather.\nBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked\nat them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had\nsuddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved\na doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and\nbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:\n_\u2014I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.\nMy mother's a jew, my father's a bird.\nWith Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.\nSo here's to disciples and Calvary._\nHe held up a forefinger of warning.\n_\u2014If anyone thinks that I amn't divine\nHe'll get no free drinks when I'm making the wine\nBut have to drink water and wish it were plain\nThat I make when the wine becomes water again._\nHe tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running\nforward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like\nfins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:\n_\u2014Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said\nAnd tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.\nWhat's bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly\nAnd Olivet's breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_\nHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his\nwinglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in the fresh\nwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.\nHaines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and\nsaid:\n\u2014We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not a\nbeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of\nit somehow, doesn't it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?\n\u2014The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.\n\u2014O, Haines said, you have heard it before?\n\u2014Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.\n\u2014You're not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in\nthe narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a\npersonal God.\n\u2014There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.\nHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a\ngreen stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.\n\u2014Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.\nHaines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his\nsidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang\nit open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk\ntowards Stephen in the shell of his hands.\n\u2014Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or\nyou don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a\npersonal God. You don't stand for that, I suppose?\n\u2014You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible\nexample of free thought.\nHe walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his\nside. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.\nMy familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line\nalong the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.\nHe wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt\nbread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his\neyes.\n\u2014After all, Haines began...\nStephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was\nnot all unkind.\n\u2014After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your\nown master, it seems to me.\n\u2014I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an\nItalian.\n\u2014Italian? Haines said.\nA crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.\n\u2014And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.\n\u2014Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?\n\u2014The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and\nthe holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\nHaines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he\nspoke.\n\u2014I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think\nlike that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you\nrather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\nThe proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph of\ntheir brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam\necclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own\nrare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass\nfor pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in\naffirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church\nmilitant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies\nfleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom\nMulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the\nconsubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning\nChrist's terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who\nheld that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken\na moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void\nawaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a\nworsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael's host, who\ndefend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their\nshields.\nHear, hear! Prolonged applause. _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_\n\u2014Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines's voice said, and I feel as one. I\ndon't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.\nThat's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now.\nTwo men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,\nboatman.\n\u2014She's making for Bullock harbour.\nThe boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.\n\u2014There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way\nwhen the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today.\nThe man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting\nfor a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,\nsaltwhite. Here I am.\nThey followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood\non a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his\nshoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly\nfrogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.\n\u2014Is the brother with you, Malachi?\n\u2014Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.\n\u2014Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young\nthing down there. Photo girl he calls her.\n\u2014Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.\nBuck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near\nthe spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,\nwater glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water\nrilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black\nsagging loincloth.\nBuck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines\nand Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and\nlips and breastbone.\n\u2014Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of\nrock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.\n\u2014Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.\n\u2014Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?\n\u2014Yes.\n\u2014Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with\nmoney.\n\u2014Is she up the pole?\n\u2014Better ask Seymour that.\n\u2014Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.\nHe nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying\ntritely:\n\u2014Redheaded women buck like goats.\nHe broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.\n\u2014My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the _\u00dcbermensch._ Toothless\nKinch and I, the supermen.\nHe struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his\nclothes lay.\n\u2014Are you going in here, Malachi?\n\u2014Yes. Make room in the bed.\nThe young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the\nmiddle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a\nstone, smoking.\n\u2014Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.\n\u2014Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.\nStephen turned away.\n\u2014I'm going, Mulligan, he said.\n\u2014Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.\nStephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped\nclothes.\n\u2014And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.\nStephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck\nMulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:\n\u2014He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake\nZarathustra.\nHis plump body plunged.\n\u2014We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the\npath and smiling at wild Irish.\nHorn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.\n\u2014The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.\n\u2014Good, Stephen said.",

What's left us then?\n\u2014I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.\n\u2014Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the\ngorescarred book.\n\u2014Yes, sir. And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done\nfor._\nThat phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a\nhill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,\nleaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.\n\u2014You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?\n\u2014End of Pyrrhus, sir?\n\u2014I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.\n\u2014Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?\nA bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them\nbetween his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered\nto the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people,\nproud that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.\n\u2014Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.\nAll laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round\nat his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh\nmore loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.\n\u2014Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,\nwhat is a pier.\n\u2014A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a\nbridge. Kingstown pier, sir.\nSome laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench\nwhispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.",

His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness\nand through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his\ncheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent\nand damp as a snail's bed.\nHe held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.\nBeneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with\nblind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.\n\u2014Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them\nto you, sir.\nStephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.\n\u2014Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.\n\u2014Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to\ncopy them off the board, sir.\n\u2014Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.\n\u2014No, sir.\nUgly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a\nsnail's bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in\nher heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him\nunderfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery\nblood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in\nlife? His mother's prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal\nbestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in\nthe fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from\nbeing trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor\nsoul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red\nreek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the\nearth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.\nSitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by\nalgebra that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather. Sargent\npeered askance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the\nlumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.\nAcross the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of\ntheir letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,\ntraverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from\nthe world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and\nmovement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the\nworld, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not\ncomprehend.\n\u2014Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?\n\u2014Yes, sir.\nIn long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a\nword of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint\nhue of shame flickering behind his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective\nand objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had\nfed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.\nLike him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My\nchildhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or\nlightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony\nsit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their\ntyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.\nThe sum was done.\n\u2014It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.\n\u2014Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.\nHe dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his\ncopybook back to his bench.",

On the sideboard the tray of Stuart\ncoins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their\nspooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached\nto all the gentiles: world without end.\nA hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his\nrare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.\n\u2014First, our little financial settlement, he said.\nHe brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It\nslapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and\nlaid them carefully on the table.\n\u2014Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.\nAnd now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand moved\nover the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money\ncowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and\nthis, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim's hoard, dead\ntreasure, hollow shells.\nA sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.\n\u2014Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.\nThese are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is\nfor shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.\nHe shot from it two crowns and two shillings.\n\u2014Three twelve, he said. I think you'll find that's right.\n\u2014Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy\nhaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.\n\u2014No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.\nStephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too\nof beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed\nand misery.\n\u2014Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You'll pull it out somewhere\nand lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very\nhandy.\nAnswer something.\n\u2014Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.\nThe same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times\nnow. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant\nif I will.\n\u2014Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don't\nknow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as\nI have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare\nsay? _Put but money in thy purse._\n\u2014Iago, Stephen murmured.\nHe lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare.\n\u2014He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but\nan Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you\nknow what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's\nmouth?\nThe seas' ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems\nhistory is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.\n\u2014That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.\n\u2014Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That's not English. A French Celt said that. He\ntapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.\n\u2014I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. _I paid\nmy way._\nGood man, good man.\n_\u2014I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel\nthat? _I owe nothing._ Can you?\nMulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.\nCurran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.\nTemple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob\nReynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five\nweeks' board. The lump I have is useless.\n\u2014For the moment, no, Stephen answered.\nMr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.\n\u2014I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.\nWe are a generous people but we must also be just.\n\u2014I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.\nMr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the\nshapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of\nWales.\n\u2014You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.\nI saw three generations since O'Connell's time. I remember the famine\nin '46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the\nunion twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your\ncommunion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.\nGlorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the\nsplendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the\nplanters' covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie\ndown.\nStephen sketched a brief gesture.\n\u2014I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But\nI am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are\nall Irish, all kings' sons.\n\u2014Alas, Stephen said.\n\u2014_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for\nit and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to\ndo so.\nLal the ral the ra\nThe rocky road to Dublin.\nA gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!\nSoft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on\nto Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.\n\u2014That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,\nwith some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.\nSit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.\nHe went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read\noff some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.\n\u2014Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of\ncommon sense._ Just a moment.\nHe peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow\nand, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,\nsometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.\nStephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed\naround the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek\nheads poised in air: lord Hastings' _Repulse_, the duke of\nWestminster's _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort's _Ceylon_, _prix de\nParis_, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their\nspeeds, backing king's colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished\ncrowds.\n\u2014Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. _But prompt ventilation of this\nallimportant question..._\nWhere Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the\nmudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek\nof the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to\none the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs,\nthe vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher's\ndame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.\nShouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.\nAgain: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a\nmedley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling\nwho seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock\nby shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of\nthe slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.\n\u2014Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.\nHe came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.\n\u2014I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It's about the\nfoot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two\nopinions on the matter.\nMay I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of _laissez faire_\nwhich so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old\nindustries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.\nEuropean conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the\nchannel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of\nagriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who\nwas no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.\n\u2014I don't mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.\nFoot and mouth disease. Known as Koch's preparation. Serum and virus.\nPercentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor's horses at M\u00fcrzsteg,\nlower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous\noffer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In\nevery sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for\nthe hospitality of your columns.\n\u2014I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the\nnext outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be\ncured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is\nregularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They\noffer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the\ndepartment. Now I'm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by\ndifficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...\nHe raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.\n\u2014Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the\njews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are\nthe signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the\nnation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as\nwe are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of\ndestruction. Old England is dying.\nHe stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a\nbroad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.\n\u2014Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.\nThe harlot's cry from street to street\nShall weave old England's windingsheet.\nHis eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which\nhe halted.\n\u2014A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or\ngentile, is he not?\n\u2014They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see\nthe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the\nearth to this day.\nOn the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting\nprices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,\nuncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit\nsilk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.\nTheir full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and\nunoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their\nzeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would\nscatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.\nTheir eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the\ndishonours of their flesh.\n\u2014Who has not? Stephen said.\n\u2014What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.\nHe came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell\nsideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from\nme.\n\u2014History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\nFrom the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.\nWhat if that nightmare gave you a back kick?\n\u2014The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human\nhistory moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.\nStephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:\n\u2014That is God.\nHooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!\n\u2014What? Mr Deasy asked.\n\u2014A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.\nMr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked\nbetween his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.\n\u2014I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and\nmany sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no\nbetter than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten\nyears the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the\nstrangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman,\nO'Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many\nerrors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the\nend of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.\nFor Ulster will fight\nAnd Ulster will be right.\nStephen raised the sheets in his hand.\n\u2014Well, sir, he began.\n\u2014I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at\nthis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am\nwrong.\n\u2014A learner rather, Stephen said.\nAnd here what will you learn more?\nMr Deasy shook his head.\n\u2014Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great\nteacher.\nStephen rustled the sheets again.\n\u2014As regards these, he began.\n\u2014Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them\npublished at once.\n_ Telegraph. Irish Homestead._\n\u2014I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two\neditors slightly.\n\u2014That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,\nM.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the\nCity Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You\nsee if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?\n_\u2014The Evening Telegraph..._\n\u2014That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to\nanswer that letter from my cousin.\n\u2014Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.\nThank you.\n\u2014Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I\nlike to break a lance with you, old as I am.\n\u2014Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.\nHe went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,\nhearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The\nlions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:\ntoothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will\ndub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.\n\u2014Mr Dedalus!\nRunning after me. No more letters, I hope.\n\u2014Just one moment.\n\u2014Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.\nMr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.\n\u2014I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of\nbeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know\nthat? No. And do you know why?\nHe frowned sternly on the bright air.\n\u2014Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.\n\u2014Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.\nA coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a\nrattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,\nhis lifted arms waving to the air.\n\u2014She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he\nstamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why.\nOn his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung",

Euge!_ Pretending to\nspeak broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence,\nacross the slimy pier at Newhaven. _Comment?_ Rich booty you brought\nback; _Le Tutu_, five tattered numbers of _Pantalon Blanc et Culotte\nRouge_; a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:\n\u2014Mother dying come home father.\nThe aunt thinks you killed your mother. That's why she won't.\nThen here's a health to Mulligan's aunt\nAnd I'll tell you the reason why.\nShe always kept things decent in\nThe Hannigan famileye.\nHis feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by\nthe boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone\nmammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is\nthere, the slender trees, the lemon houses.\nParis rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of\nfarls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the\nair. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife, the\nkerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In\nRodot's Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering\nwith gold teeth _chaussons_ of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the\n_pus_ of _flan br\u00e9ton_. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased\npleasers, curled conquistadores.\nNoon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers\nsmeared with printer's ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his\nwhite. About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. _Un demi\ns\u00e9tier!_ A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves\nme at his beck. _Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux\nirlandais, nous, Irlande, vous savez ah, oui!_ She thought you wanted a\ncheese _hollandais_. Your postprandial, do you know that word?\nPostprandial. There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer\nfellow, used to call it his postprandial. Well: _slainte!_ Around the\nslabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His\nbreath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy's fang\nthrusting between his lips. Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes,\nconspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now, A E, pimander, good shepherd of\nmen. To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause. You're\nyour father's son. I know the voice. His fustian shirt,\nsanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at his secrets. M.\nDrumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called queen\nVictoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. _Vieille ogresse_ with the\n_dents jaunes_. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, _La Patrie_, M. Millevoye,\nF\u00e9lix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The froeken, _bonne \u00e0\ntout faire_, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala. _Moi\nfaire_, she said, _Tous les messieurs_. Not this _Monsieur_, I said.\nMost licentious custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn't let my\nbrother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing. Green eyes, I\nsee you. Fang, I feel. Lascivious people.\nThe blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose\ntobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw\nfacebones under his peep of day boy's hat. How the head centre got\naway, authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil,\norangeblossoms, drove out the road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost\nleaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not\nhere.\nSpurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell\nyou. I'll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her\nlove he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under\nthe walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl\nthem upward in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay\nParee he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his\nday's stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the\nMontmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or,\ndamascened with flyblown faces of the gone. Loveless, landless,\nwifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in\nrue G\u00eet-le-C\u0153ur, canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra\nskirt, frisky as a young thing's. Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat\nyou saw me, won't you? I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time. _Mon\nfils_, soldier of France. I taught him to sing _The boys of Kilkenny\nare stout roaring blades_. Know that old lay? I taught Patrice that.\nOld Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow's castle on the Nore. Goes like\nthis. _O, O_. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.\nO, O the boys of\nKilkenny...\nWeak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.\nRemembering thee, O Sion.\nHe had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.",

Into the ineluctable modality\nof the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at\nHodges Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet\nbooks you were going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through\nthe braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a\ngrief and kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else,\nStevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders\nand yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple\ndumplings, _piuttosto_. Where are your wits?\nTouch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me\nsoon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.\nSad too. Touch, touch me.\nHe lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the\nscribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his\neyes. That is Kevin Egan's movement I made, nodding for his nap,\nsabbath sleep. _Et vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona_. Alo! _Bonjour_.\nWelcome as the flowers in May. Under its leaf he watched through\npeacocktwittering lashes the southing sun. I am caught in this burning\nscene. Pan's hour, the faunal noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants,\nmilkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is\nfar.\nAnd no more turn aside and brood.\nHis gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck's castoffs,\n_nebeneinander_. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein\nanother's foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in\ntripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt's\nshoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. _Tiens, quel petit pied!_\nStaunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde's love that dare not speak its\nname. His arm: Cranly's arm. He now will leave me. And the blame? As I\nam. As I am. All or not at all.\nIn long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering\ngreengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float\naway. I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the\nlow rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a\nfourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of\nwaters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it\nslops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech\nceases. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower\nunfurling.\nUnder the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and\nsway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water\nswaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night:\nlifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,\nthey sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,\nawaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias\npatiens ingemiscit_. To no end gathered; vainly then released,\nforthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of\nlovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws\na toil of waters.\nFive fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he\nsaid. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a\nloose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse\nrising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise\nlandward. There he is. Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath\nthe watery floor. We have him. Easy now.\nBag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a\nspongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God\nbecomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed\nmountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a\nurinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes\nupward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to\nthe sun.\nA seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths\nknown to man. Old Father Ocean. _Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.\nJust you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.\nCome. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?\nThunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,\n_Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_. No. My cockle hat and staff and\nhismy sandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.\nHe took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying\nstill. Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make\ntheir end. By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.\nOf all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn\nTennyson, gentleman poet. _Gi\u00e0_. For the old hag with the yellow teeth.\nAnd Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. _Gi\u00e0_. My teeth are very\nbad. Why, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to\na dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch,\nthe superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?\nMy handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?\nHis hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy one.\nHe laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,\ncarefully. For the rest let look who will.\nBehind. Perhaps there is someone.\nHe turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the\nair high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the\ncrosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.\n\u2014 II \u2014",

            "text": "Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.\nHe liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,\nliverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all he\nliked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of\nfaintly scented urine.\nKidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting\nher breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the\nkitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him\nfeel a bit peckish.\nThe coals were reddening.\nAnother slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn't like\nher plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off\nthe hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat,\nits spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked\nstiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.\n\u2014Mkgnao!\n\u2014O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.\nThe cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the\ntable, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch\nmy head. Prr.\nMr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:\nthe gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her\ntail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his\nknees.\n\u2014Milk for the pussens, he said.\n\u2014Mrkgnao! the cat cried.\nThey call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we\nunderstand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too.\nCruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder\nwhat I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.\n\u2014Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the\nchookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.\n\u2014Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.\nShe blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively\nand long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits\nnarrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to\nthe dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him,\npoured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.\n\u2014Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.\nHe watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped\nthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they\ncan't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or\nkind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.\nHe listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with\nthis drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for\na mutton kidney at Buckley's. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.\nBetter a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. While the kettle is boiling. She\nlapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so\nrough? To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced\nround him. No.\nOn quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by\nthe bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter\nshe likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.\nHe said softly in the bare hall:\n\u2014I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.\nAnd when he had heard his voice say it he added:\n\u2014You don't want anything for breakfast?\nA sleepy soft grunt answered:\n\u2014Mn.\nNo. She didn't want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,\nas she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.\nMust get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.\nForgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for\nit. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor's auction.\nGot a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At\nPlevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it. Still\nhe had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was\nfarseeing.\nHis hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat\nand his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback\npictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.\nThe sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's\nhigh grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White\nslip of paper. Quite safe.\nOn the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.\nIn the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky\nwardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He\npulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf\ndropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right\ntill I come back anyhow.",

            "text": "He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number\nseventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. Be a\nwarm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black\nconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in\nthat light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as\nhe walked in happy warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our\ndaily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.\nMakes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at\ndawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him.\nKeep it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a\nstrand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker\ntoo, old Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.\nWander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of\ncarpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking\na coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented\nwith fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two.\nWell, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among\nthe pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees,\nsignal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches\nme from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark\nlanguage. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet,\ncolour of Molly's new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of\nthose instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.\nProbably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track\nof the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself.\nWhat Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_\nleader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway\nbehind the bank of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch\nthat: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.\nHe approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up the\nflabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out\nwhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the\nend of the city traffic. For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as\nposition. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular\nfrom the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.\nBaldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an\nad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my\nbold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching\nthe aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him\noff to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I'm going to\ntell you? What's that, Mr O'Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,\nthey'd only be an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese.\nStop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor\nDignam, Mr O'Rourke.\nTurning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the\ndoorway:\n\u2014Good day, Mr O'Rourke.\n\u2014Good day to you.\n\u2014Lovely weather, sir.\n\u2014'Tis all that.\nWhere do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the\ncounty Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and\nbehold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think\nof the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin\nwithout passing a pub. Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put\ndown three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs\nand drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with\nthe town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we'll split the\njob, see?\nHow much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels\nof stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint\nJoseph's National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps\nmemory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee\ndoubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At\ntheir joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.\nHe halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages,\npolonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened\nin his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,\npacked with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the\nlukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood.\nA kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He\nstood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too,\ncalling the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a\npound and a half of Denny's sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous\nhips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New\nblood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on\nthe clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked\nskirt swings at each whack.\nThe ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with\nblotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.\nHe took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at\nKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter\nsanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round\nit, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:\nread it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page\nrustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the\nbeasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the\nbreeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a\npalm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled\nswitches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his\nsenses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt\nswinging, whack by whack by whack.\nThe porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime\nsausages and made a red grimace.\n\u2014Now, my miss, he said.\nShe tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.\n\u2014Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,\nplease?\nMr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went\nslowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the\nmorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood\noutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He\nsighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted\ntoenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The\nsting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For\nanother: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles' Lane. They like\nthem sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the\nwood.\n\u2014Threepence, please.\nHis hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.\nThen it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them\non the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,\ndisc by disc, into the till.\n\u2014Thank you, sir. Another time.\nA speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze\nafter an instant. No: better not: another time.\n\u2014Good morning, he said, moving away.\n\u2014Good morning, sir.\nNo sign. Gone. What matter?",

Vain: very.\nHe smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught\nher in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a\nlittle. Was given milk too long. On the _Erin's King_ that day round\nthe Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue\nscarf loose in the wind with her hair.\nAll dimpled cheeks and curls,\nYour head it simply swirls.\nSeaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers' pockets,\njarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says.\nPier with lamps, summer evening, band.\nThose girls, those girls,\nThose lovely seaside girls.\nMilly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.\nReading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,\nbraiding.\nA soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will\nhappen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips.\nWill happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to\nmove now. Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.\nBetter where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass\nthe time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two\nand six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or\nthrough M'Coy.\nThe cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,\nnosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing.\nWants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her\nwait. Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her\near with her back to the fire too.\nHe felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood\nup, undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.\n\u2014Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I'm ready.\nHeaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the\nlanding.\nA paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as\nI'm.\nIn the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_. He folded it\nunder his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in\nsoft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.\nListening, he heard her voice:\n\u2014Come, come, pussy. Come.\nHe went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen\ntowards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.\nThe maid was in the garden. Fine morning.\nHe bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.\nMake a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to\nmanure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur.\nAll soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this\nthat is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top\ndressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are\nfed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid\ngloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in\nthat corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still\ngardens have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.\nHe walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the\npeg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don't remember that. Hallstand\ntoo full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters.\nDrago's shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown\nbrillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder\nhave I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox\nthere got away James Stephens, they say. O'Brien.\nDeep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.\nEnthusiast.\nHe kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to\nget these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head\nunder the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy\nlimewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he\npeered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his\ncountinghouse. Nobody.\nAsquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over\non his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a\nbit. Our prize titbit: _Matcham's Masterstroke_. Written by Mr Philip\nBeaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a\ncolumn has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds\nthree. Three pounds, thirteen and six.\nQuietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding\nbut resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding,\nhe allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading\nstill patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope\nit's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive.\nOne tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or\ntouch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now.\nSilly season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat\ncertainly. _Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won\nthe laughing witch who now_. Begins and ends morally. _Hand in hand_.\nSmart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his\nwater flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and\nreceived payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.\nMight manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for\nsome proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what\nshe said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving.\nBiting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her.\n9.15. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23.\nWhat possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I'm swelled after that\ncabbage. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.\nRubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning\nafter the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the\nhours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then\nnight hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head\ndancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.\nWhy? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use\nhumming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The\nmirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen\nvest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.\nIt wouldn't pan out somehow.\nEvening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with\ndaggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then\nblack. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.\nHe tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.\nThen he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled\nback the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom\ninto the air.\nIn the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully\nhis black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What\ntime is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.\nA creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George's\nchurch. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.\nHeigho! Heigho!\nHeigho! Heigho!",

Women knelt in the\nbenches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch\nknelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring,\nholding the thing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a\ncommunion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it\nneatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her\nhat sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent\ndown to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next\none. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? _Corpus:_ body. Corpse.\nGood idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They\ndon't seem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a\ncorpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.\nHe stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by\none, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in\nits corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.\nWe ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here\nand there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for\nit to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it's that\nsort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes\nthem feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it's called.\nThere's a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you\nfeel. First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one\nfamily party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I'm\nsure of that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit\nspreeish. Let off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes\ncure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.\nOld fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind\nfaith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time\nnext year.\nHe saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an\ninstant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace\naffair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn't know what\nto do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.\nMolly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have\nsuffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.\nMeet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with\na veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here\nwith a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the\nsly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the\ninvincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion\nevery morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I\nam thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six\nchildren at home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those\ncrawthumpers, now that's a good name for them, there's always something\nshiftylooking about them. They're not straight men of business either.\nO, no, she's not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up\nthat envelope? Yes: under the bridge.\nThe priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs\nsmartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank\nwhat they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage\nWheatley's Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale\n(aromatic). Doesn't give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.\nCold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they'd have one\nold booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer\nthe whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.\nMr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music.\nPity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make\nthat instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he\nhad in Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat\nMater_ of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. Christ or\nPilate? Christ, but don't keep us all night over it. Music they wanted.\nFootdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice\nagainst that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the\npeople looking up:\n_Quis est homo._\nSome of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.\nMozart's twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that. Those old popes keen on music,\non art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example\ntoo. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting,\nregular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse.\nStill, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.\nWhat kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own\nstrong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after.\nKind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don't they? Gluttons,\ntall, long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.\nHe saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and\nbless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom\nglanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand\nup at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again\nand he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the\naltar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered\neach other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a\ncard:\n\u2014O God, our refuge and our strength...\nMr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them\nthe bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious\nand immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More\ninteresting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful\norganisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants\nto. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon\nin their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I\nschschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look\ndown at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears.\nHusband learn to his surprise. God's little joke. Then out she comes.\nRepentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy\nMary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation\narmy blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.\nHow I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they\nwork the whole show. And don't they rake in the money too? Bequests\nalso: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion. Masses\nfor the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.\nMonasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the\nwitnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything.\nLiberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of\nthe church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.\nThe priest prayed:\n\u2014Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our\nsafeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God\nrestrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly\nhost, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those\nother wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of\nsouls.\nThe priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women\nremained behind: thanksgiving.",

Huguenot churchyard near there. Visit some day.\nHe walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other\ntrousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair.\nO well, poor fellow, it's not his fault. When was it I got it made up\nlast? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it\nmust have been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions\nbook.\nThe chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he\nseems to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher's\nstone. The alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy\nthen. Why? Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your\ncharacter. Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants.\nAll his alabaster lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te\nVirid. Smell almost cure you like the dentist's doorbell. Doctor Whack.\nHe ought to physic himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first\nfellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples.\nWant to be careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns\nblue litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping\ndraughts. Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the\npores or the phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least\nexpect it. Clever of nature.\n\u2014About a fortnight ago, sir?\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said.\nHe waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the\ndusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling\nyour aches and pains.\n\u2014Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then\norangeflower water...\nIt certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.\n\u2014And white wax also, he said.\nBrings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her\neyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my\ncuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the\nteeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.\nSkinfood. One of the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only\none skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to\nmake it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your?\n_Peau d'Espagne_. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these\nsoaps have. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner.\nHammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a\nnice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious\nlonging I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time\nfor massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.\n\u2014Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a\nbottle?\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I'll call later in the day and\nI'll take one of these soaps. How much are they?\n\u2014Fourpence, sir.\nMr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.\n\u2014I'll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.\n\u2014Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you",

Mr Power stepped in\nafter him, curving his height with care.\n\u2014Come on, Simon.\n\u2014After you, Mr Bloom said.\nMr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:\n\u2014Yes, yes.\n\u2014Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.\nMr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to\nafter him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm\nthrough the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow\nat the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman\npeeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she\nwas passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad\nto see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.\nHuggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd\nwake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming\nmaking the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know\nwho will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the\nnails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same\nafter. Unclean job.\nAll waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am\nsitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better\nshift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.\nAll waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:\nthen horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and\nswaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of\nthe avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.\nAt walking pace.\nThey waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were\npassing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels\nrattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook\nrattling in the doorframes.\n\u2014What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.\n\u2014Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.\nMr Dedalus nodded, looking out.\n\u2014That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died\nout.\nAll watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by\npassers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the\nsmoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,\nclad in mourning, a wide hat.\n\u2014There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.\n\u2014Who is that?\n\u2014Your son and heir.\n\u2014Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.\nThe carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway\nbefore the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back\nto the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus\nfell back, saying:\n\u2014Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.\n\u2014Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding\nfaction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump\nof dung, the wise child that knows her own father.\nMr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the\nbottleworks: Dodder bridge.\nRichie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls\nthe firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing\nin Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the\nlandlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.\nBeginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife\nironing his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they\nare. About six hundred per cent profit.\n\u2014He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a\ncontaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks\nall over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll\nmake it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother\nor his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a\ngate. I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.\nHe cried above the clatter of the wheels:\n\u2014I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's\nson. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.\nHe ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild\nface and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy\nselfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If\nlittle Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.\nWalking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange\nfeeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that\nmorning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs\nat it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning\nup. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us\na touch, Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.\nGot big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.\nI could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent.\nLearn German too.\n\u2014Are we late? Mr Power asked.\n\u2014Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.\nMolly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping\nJupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a\nwoman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.\nLife, life.\nThe carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.\n\u2014Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.\n\u2014He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do\nyou follow me?\nHe closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away\ncrustcrumbs from under his thighs.\n\u2014What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?\n\u2014Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power\nsaid.\nAll raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless\nleather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward\nand said:\n\u2014Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?\n\u2014It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.\nMr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite\nclean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.\nMr Dedalus sighed resignedly.\n\u2014After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.\n\u2014Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of\nhis beard gently.\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.\n\u2014And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.\n\u2014At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.",

            "text": "\u2014I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.\nThe carriage halted short.\n\u2014What's wrong?\n\u2014We're stopped.\n\u2014Where are we?\nMr Bloom put his head out of the window.\n\u2014The grand canal, he said.\nGasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got\nit. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame\nreally. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed\ntea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss\nthis chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,\nLeopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.\nA dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's\ndogs usually are.\nA raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower\nspray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a\ncolander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.\n\u2014The weather is changing, he said quietly.\n\u2014A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.\n\u2014Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming\nout.\nMr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled\na mute curse at the sky.\n\u2014It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.\n\u2014We're off again.\nThe carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed\ngently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.\n\u2014Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking\nhim off to his face.\n\u2014O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear\nhim, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of _The Croppy Boy_.\n\u2014Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. _His singing of that simple\nballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the\nwhole course of my experience._\n\u2014Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the\nretrospective arrangement.\n\u2014Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.\n\u2014I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?\n\u2014In the paper this morning.\nMr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change\nfor her.\n\u2014No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.\nMr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the\ndeaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what\nPeake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton,\nUrbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.\nThanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief\nof his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind:\nQuinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.\nIt is now a month since dear Henry fled\nTo his home up above in the sky\nWhile his family weeps and mourns his loss\nHoping some day to meet him on high.\nI tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it\nin the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry\nfled. Before my patience are exhausted.\nNational school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.\nFull as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round\nwith a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their\nhats.\nA pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a\ntramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something\nautomatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow\nwould lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job\nmaking the new invention?\nAntient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a\ncrape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law\nperhaps.\nThey went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway\nbridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene\nStratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I\nwonder. I said I. Or the _Lily of Killarney_? Elster Grimes Opera\nCompany. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. _Fun on\nthe Bristol_. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have\nto stand a drink or two. As broad as it's long.\nHe's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.\nPlasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?\n\u2014How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in\nsalute.\n\u2014He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?\n\u2014Who? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\u2014Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.\nJust that moment I was thinking.\nMr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the\nwhite disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.\nMr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right\nhand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?\nFascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes\nfeel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am\njust looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body\ngetting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes\nthat? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh\nfalls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.\nHips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the\ncheeks behind.\nHe clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant\nglance over their faces.\nMr Power asked:\n\u2014How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?\n\u2014O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good\nidea, you see...\n\u2014Are you going yourself?\n\u2014Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the\ncounty Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the\nchief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.\n\u2014Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.\nHave you good artists?\n\u2014Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all\ntopnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in\nfact.\n\u2014And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.\nMr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and\nclasped them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.\nWoman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage\nwheeling by Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting\nknees.\nOot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his\nmouth opening: oot.\n\u2014Four bootlaces for a penny.\nWonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.\nSame house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.\nHas that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.\nTerrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.\nO'Callaghan on his last legs.\nAnd _Madame_. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing\nher hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_. No: _vorrei e non_. Looking\nat the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. _Mi trema un poco\nil_. Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A\nthrostle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.\nHis eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over\nthe ears. _Madame_: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.\nOnly politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the\nwoman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it\ntold me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played\nout pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her\na pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the\nMoira, was it?\nThey passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.\nMartin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.\n\u2014Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.\nA tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner\nof Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his\nspine.\n\u2014In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.\nMr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:\n\u2014The devil break the hasp of your back!\nMr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as\nthe carriage passed Gray's statue.\n\u2014We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.\nHis eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:\n\u2014Well, nearly all of us.\nMr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.\n\u2014That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and\nthe son.\n\u2014About the boatman? Mr Power asked.\n\u2014Yes. Isn't it awfully good?\n\u2014What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.\n\u2014There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to\nsend him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were\nboth.....\n\u2014What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried\nto drown.....\n\u2014Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!\nMr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....\nMartin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:\n\u2014Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on\ntheir way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got\nloose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.\n\u2014For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?\n\u2014Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished\nhim out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father\non the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....\n\u2014And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for\nsaving his son's life.\nA stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.\n\u2014O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.\n\u2014Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.\n\u2014One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.\nMr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.\nNelson's pillar.\n\u2014Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!\n\u2014We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.\nMr Dedalus sighed.\n\u2014Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh.\nMany a good one he told himself.\n\u2014The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his\nfingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last\nand he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this.\nHe's gone from us.\n\u2014As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went\nvery suddenly.\n\u2014Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.\nHe tapped his chest sadly.\nBlazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.\nDrink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent\ncolouring it.\nMr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.\n\u2014He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.\n\u2014The best death, Mr Bloom said.\nTheir wide open eyes looked at him.\n\u2014No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.\nNo-one spoke.\nDead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,\ntemperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college,\nGill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or\nwind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the\nlate Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.\nWhite horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,\ngalloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning\ncoach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for\na nun.\n\u2014Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.\nA dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's\nbody, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society\npays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant\nnothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If\nnot from the man. Better luck next time.\n\u2014Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.\nThe carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his\nbones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.\n\u2014In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.\n\u2014But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own\nlife.\nMartin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.\n\u2014The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.\n\u2014Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We\nmust take a charitable view of it.\n\u2014They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.\n\u2014It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.\nMr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's\nlarge eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.\nLike Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy\non that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to\ndrive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't\nbroken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the\nriverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of\na wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then\npawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the\nlife of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday\nmorning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have\nlooked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about\nthe place and capering with Martin's umbrella.\nAnd they call me the jewel of Asia,\nOf Asia,\nThe geisha.\nHe looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.\nThat afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The\nroom in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight\nthrough the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big\nand hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw\nlike yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the\nbed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son\nLeopold.\nNo more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.\nThe carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.\n\u2014We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.\n\u2014God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.\n\u2014I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow\nin Germany. The Gordon Bennett.\n\u2014Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.\nAs they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent\nover and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has\nanybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from _Saul._\nHe's as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The\n_Mater Misericordiae_. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place.\nWard for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the\ndying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They\nlook terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the\nspoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student\nthat was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the\nlying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other.\nThe carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.\n\u2014What's wrong now?\nA divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching\nby on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony\ncroups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their\nfear.\n\u2014Emigrants, Mr Power said.\n\u2014Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.\nHuuuh! out of that!\nThursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold\nthem about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for\nold England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter\nlost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a\nyear. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,\nsoap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off\nthe train at Clonsilla.\nThe carriage moved on through the drove.\n\u2014I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the\nparkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken\nin trucks down to the boats.\n\u2014Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite\nright. They ought to.\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have\nmunicipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line\nout to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage\nand all. Don't you see what I mean?\n\u2014O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon\ndiningroom.\n\u2014A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.\n\u2014Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent\nthan galloping two abreast?\n\u2014Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.\n\u2014And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when\nthe hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.\n\u2014That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell\nabout the road. Terrible!\n\u2014First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.\n\u2014Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.\nBom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy\nDignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too\nlarge for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up\nnow. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides\ndecompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also.\nWith wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.\n\u2014Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.\nDunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A\npause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up\nhere on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.\nElixir of life.\nBut suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in",

Still some might ooze out of an artery.\nIt would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.\nIn silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted\nby, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.\nCrossguns bridge: the royal canal.\nWater rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping\nbarge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a\nslacktethered horse. Aboard of the _Bugabu._\nTheir eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on\nhis raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of\nreeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,\nMoyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or\ncycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at\nthe auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby to\nrow me o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.\nCamping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without\nwriting. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by\nlock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his\nbrown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.\nThey drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.\n\u2014I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.\n\u2014Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.\n\u2014How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?\n\u2014Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.\nThe carriage steered left for Finglas road.\nThe stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of\nland silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,\nknelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:\nappealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder\nand sculptor.\nPassed.\nOn the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat,\ngrumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown\nyawning boot. After life's journey.\nGloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.\nMr Power pointed.\n\u2014That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.\n\u2014So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.\nMurdered his brother. Or so they said.\n\u2014The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.\n\u2014Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That's the maxim of the\nlaw. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent\nperson to be wrongfully condemned.\nThey looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,\ntenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully\ncondemned. Murder. The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered.\nThey love reading about it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing\nconsisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used.\nMurderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed.\nMurder will out.\nCramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without\nletting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with\ntheir pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.\nThe high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,\nrare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the\ntrees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain\ngestures on the air.\nThe felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put\nout his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with\nhis knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.\nChange that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly\nand transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.\nHe stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand\nstill held.\nPaltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same.\nPallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.\nBeyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and\nfruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.\nDogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.\nHe followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes\nwalking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took\nout the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.\nWhere is that child's funeral disappeared to?",

The waggoner marching at their head saluted.\nCoffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at\nit with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck,\npressing on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out\nhere every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount\nJerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere\nevery minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.\nThousands every hour. Too many in the world.\nMourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,\nhard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt\nand tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to\ncry. Fish's face, bloodless and livid.\nThe mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So\nmuch dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First\nthe stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy\nfollowed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the\nbrother-in-law.\nAll walked after.\nMartin Cunningham whispered:\n\u2014I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.\n\u2014What? Mr Power whispered. How so?\n\u2014His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the\nQueen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.\nAnniversary.\n\u2014O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?\nHe glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed\ntowards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.\n\u2014Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.\n\u2014I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily\nmortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.\n\u2014How many children did he leave?\n\u2014Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.\n\u2014A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.\n\u2014A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.\n\u2014Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.\nHas the laugh at him now.\nHe looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had\noutlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must\noutlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the\nworld. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow\nhim. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who\nknows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on\na guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in\nthe end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of\nhearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the\nsubstance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,\nwaiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground:\nand lie no more in her warm bed.\n\u2014How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't\nseen you for a month of Sundays.\n\u2014Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?\n\u2014I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert\nsaid. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.\n\u2014And how is Dick, the solid man?\n\u2014Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.\n\u2014By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?\n\u2014Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,\npointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the\ninsurance is cleared up.\n\u2014Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?\n\u2014Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is\nbehind. He put down his name for a quid.\n\u2014I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought\nto mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.\n\u2014How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?\n\u2014Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.\nThey halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood\nbehind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and\nat the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was\nhe there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last\nmoment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe\nthree shillings to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the\ncoffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?\nAfter a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened\nlight. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow\ncandles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a\nwreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners\nknelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the\nfont and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper\nfrom his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black\nhat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.\nA server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a\ndoor. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with\none hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's\nbelly. Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.\nThey halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book\nwith a fluent croak.\nFather Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. _Dominenamine._ Bully\nabout the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe\nbetide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst\nsideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on\nhim like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:\nburst sideways.\n_\u2014Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._\nMakes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem\nmass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist.\nChilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning\nin the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a\ntoad too. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after\ncabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an\ninfernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they\nget like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the\nvaults of saint Werburgh's lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have\nto bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn\nit. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you're a goner.\nMy kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.\nThe priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's\nbucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end\nand shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As\nyou were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.\n_\u2014Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._\nThe server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be\nbetter to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course\n...\nHoly water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed\nup with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.\nWhat harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day\na fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in\nchildbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls\nwith little sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same\nthing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam\nnow.\n_\u2014In paradisum._\nSaid he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over\neverybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.\nThe priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny\nKelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the\ncoffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny\nKelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All\nfollowed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom",

Let Him take me whenever He likes.\nBreaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little\nin his walk. Mr Power took his arm.\n\u2014She's better where she is, he said kindly.\n\u2014I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in\nheaven if there is a heaven.\nCorny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to\nplod by.\n\u2014Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.\nMr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.\n\u2014The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can\ndo so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.\nThey covered their heads.\n\u2014The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think?\nMr Kernan said with reproof.\nMr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret\neyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We\nare the last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.\nMr Kernan added:\n\u2014The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more\nimpressive I must say.\nMr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.\nMr Kernan said with solemnity:\n\u2014_I am the resurrection and the life_. That touches a man's inmost\nheart.\n\u2014It does, Mr Bloom said.\nYour heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two\nwith his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.\nBroken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood\nevery day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of\nthem lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn\nthe thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you\nare dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves.\nCome forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last\nday! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and\nthe rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning.\nPennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy\nmeasure.\nCorny Kelleher fell into step at their side.\n\u2014Everything went off A1, he said. What?\nHe looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With\nyour tooraloom tooraloom.\n\u2014As it should be, Mr Kernan said.\n\u2014What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.\nMr Kernan assured him.\n\u2014Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I\nknow his face.\nNed Lambert glanced back.\n\u2014Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the\nsoprano. She's his wife.\n\u2014O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some\ntime. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen\nseventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good\narmful she was.\nHe looked behind through the others.\n\u2014What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery\nline? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.\nNed Lambert smiled.\n\u2014Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.\n\u2014In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like\nthat for? She had plenty of game in her then.\n\u2014Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.\nJohn Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.\nThe barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the\ngrasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.\n\u2014John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.\nMr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:\n\u2014I am come to pay you another visit.\n\u2014My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want\nyour custom at all.\nSaluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin\nCunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.\n\u2014Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?\n\u2014I did not, Martin Cunningham said.\nThey bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The\ncaretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke\nin a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.\n\u2014They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy\nevening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for\nMulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After\ntraipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the\ndrunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was\nblinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.\nThe caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He\nresumed:\n\u2014And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like\nthe man_, says he. _That's not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.\nRewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,\naccepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as\nhe walked.\n\u2014That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.\n\u2014I know, Hynes said. I know that.\n\u2014To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure\ngoodheartedness: damn the thing else.\nMr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on\ngood terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort.\nKeys: like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout\nchecks. _Habeas corpus_. I must see about that ad after the funeral.\nDid I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she\ndisturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it's not chucked in the dead\nletter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's\nthe first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross.\nSilver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the\ngumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard.\nDangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death.\nShades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The\nshadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be\na descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy\nman great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o'\nthe wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at\nall. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to\nmake her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a\npitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they'd\nkiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards.\nLearn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here.\nMen like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In\nthe midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the\npoor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their\nvitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window.\nEight children he has anyway.\nHe has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field\nafter field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.\nSitting or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some\nday above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed\nthe ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim\ngrass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so\nit is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant\npoppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic\nGardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives\nnew life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.\nEvery man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,\ninvaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William\nWilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds\nthirteen and six. With thanks.\nI daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,\nnails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot\nquick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a\ntallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing\nout of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever\nthey are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically.\nNothing to feed on feed on themselves.\nBut they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply\nswirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little\nseaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of\npower seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at\nlife. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one\nabout the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11\np.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the\nmen anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's\nin fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep\nout the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.\nGravediggers in _Hamlet_. Shows the profound knowledge of the human\nheart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. _De mortuis\nnil nisi prius_. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral.\nSeems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live\nlonger. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.\n\u2014How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.\n\u2014Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.\nThe caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to\ntrundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,\nstepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin\nand set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.\nBurying him. We come to bury C\u00e6sar. His ides of March or June. He\ndoesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot\nover there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd\ngive a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never\ndreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he\ncould. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though\nhe could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too.\nFirst thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was\ntrue to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a\nThursday if you come to look at it.\nO, poor Robinson Crusoe!\nHow could you possibly do so?\nPoor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of\nthem all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could\ninvent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that\nway. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's.\nThey're so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the\nholy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one\ncoffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible\neven in the earth. The Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in\ncatacombs, mummies the same idea.\nMr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.\nTwelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.\nDeath's number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the\nchapel, that I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.\nNice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had\none like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he\nwas once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey\nsuit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's\nnot married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for\nhim.\nThe coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the\ngravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.\nPause.\nIf we were all suddenly somebody else.\nFar away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they\nsay. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.\nGentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The\nboy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in\nthe black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly\ncaretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which\nwill go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment\nyou feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake\nmust be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I\nhaven't yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering\naround you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and\nwandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His\nsleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose\npointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the\npillow away and finish it off on the floor since he's doomed. Devil in\nthat picture of sinner's death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace\nher in his shirt. Last act of _Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee_?\nBam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you.\nDon't forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even\nParnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one\nafter the other.\nWe are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and\nnot in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the\nfire of purgatory.\nDoes he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do\nwhen you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning.\nNear you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma,\npoor mamma, and little Rudy.\nThe gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in\non the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all\nthe time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of\ncourse. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some\nlaw to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a\ntelephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of\ndistress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well\nto get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no.\nThe clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.\nThe caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of\nit. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves\nwithout show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make\nits way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground,\nhe traversed the dismal fields.\nHynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he\nknows them all. No: coming to me.\n\u2014I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your\nchristian name? I'm not sure.\n\u2014L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He\nasked me to.\n\u2014Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the _Freeman_ once.\nSo he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good\nidea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He\ndied of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.\nCharley, you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does\nno harm. I saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave\nhim under an obligation: costs nothing.\n\u2014And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was\nover there in the...\nHe looked around.\n\u2014Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?\n\u2014M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his\nname?\nHe moved away, looking about him.\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!\nDidn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all\nthe. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good\nLord, what became of him?\nA seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.\n\u2014O, excuse me!\nHe stepped aside nimbly.\nClay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.\nA mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested\ntheir spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped\nhis wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The\ngravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards\nthe barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One\nbent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his\nmates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.\nSilently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.\nThe brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.\nThanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For\nyourselves just.\nThe mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying\nat whiles to read a name on a tomb.\n\u2014Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.\n\u2014Let us, Mr Power said.\nThey turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr\nPower's blank voice spoke:\n\u2014Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled\nwith stones. That one day he will come again.\nHynes shook his head.\n\u2014Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was\nmortal of him. Peace to his ashes.\nMr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,\nbroken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,\nold Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on\nsome charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does\nanybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a\ncoalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls' day.\nTwentyseventh I'll be at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He\nkeeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his\nshears clipping. Near death's door. Who passed away. Who departed this\nlife. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of\nthem. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what\nthey were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid\nfive shillings in the pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked\ngood Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that\npoem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest\nthe protestants put it. Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him\nhome. Well it's God's acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly\nplastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the\n_Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths\nhung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money.\nStill, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome,\nnever withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.\nA bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the\nwedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.\nKnows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even\nsadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen\nmatchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.\nThe Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be\nsideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was\ndedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this\ninfliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket\nof fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the\nboy. Apollo that was.\nHow many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed.\nAs you are now so once were we.\nBesides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the\nvoice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in\nthe house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.\nKraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain\nhellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph\nreminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after\nfifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that\ndied when I was in Wisdom Hely's.\nRtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!\nHe looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he\ngoes.\nAn obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the\npebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey\nalive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.\nGood hidingplace for treasure.\nWho lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was\nburied here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.\nTail gone now.\nOne of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones\nclean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat\ngone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that\n_Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a\ncorpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the\nother firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the\nplague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to\nashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by\nbirds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See\nyour whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can't\nbury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news\ngo about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication.\nWe learned that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed\nfor them. Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They\nwouldn't care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of\ncorpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.\nThe gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.\nEnough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I\nwas here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.\nAnd even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I\nread of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running\ngravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after\ndeath. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after\ndeath. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like\nthat other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and\nfeel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their\nmaggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds:\nwarm fullblooded life.\nMartin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.\nSolicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,\ncommissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.\nMat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl,\ncigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got\nhis rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside\nhim. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to\nme. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the\nlilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are\nby.\nGot a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.\n\u2014Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.\nThey stopped.\n\u2014Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.\nJohn Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.\n\u2014There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.\nJohn Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed\nthe nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head\nagain.\n\u2014It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.\nJohn Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.\n\u2014Thank you, he said shortly.\nThey walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a\nfew paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin\ncould wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his\nseeing it.\nOyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.\nGet the pull over him that way.\nThank you. How grand we are this morning!",

How's that for high?\n\u2014Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.\nNed Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:\n\u2014_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_. O boys! O boys!\n\u2014And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on\nthe fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.\n\u2014That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don't want to\nhear any more of the stuff.\nHe ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,\nhungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.\nHigh falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.\nRather upsets a man's day, a funeral does. He has influence they say.\nOld Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his\ngreatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death\nwritten this long time perhaps.

I just want to phone about an ad.\nHe went in.\n\u2014What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming\nto the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.\n\u2014That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.\nHello, Jack. That's all right.\n\u2014Good day, Myles, J. J. O'Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip\nlimply back on the file.

He came in quickly and bumped\nagainst Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.\n\u2014_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and\nmaking a grimace.\n\u2014My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I'm in a\nhurry.\n\u2014Knee, Lenehan said.\nHe made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:\n\u2014The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.\n\u2014Sorry, Mr Bloom said.\nHe went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O'Molloy\nslapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a\nmouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on\nthe doorsteps:\nWe are the boys of Wexford\nWho fought with heart and hand.\nEXIT BLOOM\n\u2014I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about this\nad of Keyes's. Want to fix it up. They tell me he's round there in\nDillon's.\nHe looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,\nleaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,\nsuddenly stretched forth an arm amply.\n\u2014Begone! he said. The world is before you.\n\u2014Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.\nJ. J. O'Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan's hand and read them,",

They\nshake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies\nwith the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in\ncoppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their\numbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.\n\u2014Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.\nLIFE ON THE RAW\n\u2014They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at\nthe north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate\nCollins, proprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from\na girl at the foot of Nelson's pillar to take off the thirst of the\nbrawn. They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile\nand begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,\nencouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the\nother have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin,\nthreatening to come down, peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God.\nThey had no idea it was that high.\nTheir names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the\nlumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who\ngot a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a\ncrubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.\n\u2014Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can\nsee them. What's keeping our friend?\nHe turned.\nA bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all\ndirections, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them\nMyles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet\nface, talking with J. J. O'Molloy.\n\u2014Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.\nHe set off again to walk by Stephen's side.\nRETURN OF BLOOM\n\u2014Yes, he said. I see them.\nMr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the\noffices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called:\n\u2014Mr Crawford! A moment!\n\u2014_Telegraph_! Racing special!\n\u2014What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.\nA newsboy cried in Mr Bloom's face:\n\u2014Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!\nINTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR\n\u2014Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,\npuffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes\njust now. He'll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he'll\nsee. But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the\nSaturday pink. And he wants it copied if it's not too late I told\ncouncillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_. I can have access to it\nin the national library. House of keys, don't you see? His name is\nKeyes. It's a play on the name. But he practically promised he'd give\nthe renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr\nCrawford?\nK.M.A.\n\u2014Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing\nout his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.\nA bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.\nLenehan's yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is\nthat young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him\ntoday. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in\nmuck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?\n\u2014Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I\nsuppose it's worth a short par. He'd give the ad, I think. I'll tell\nhim...\nK.M.R.I.A.\n\u2014He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his\nshoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.\nWhile Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on\njerkily.\nRAISING THE WIND\n\u2014_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I'm up to\nhere. I've been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to\nback a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take\nthe will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the\nwind anyhow.\nJ. J. O'Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught\nup on the others and walked abreast.\n\u2014When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty\nfingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the\nrailings.\n\u2014Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old\nDublin women on the top of Nelson's pillar.\nSOME COLUMN!\u2014THAT'S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID\n\u2014That's new, Myles Crawford said. That's copy. Out for the waxies'\nDargle. Two old trickies, what?\n\u2014But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see\nthe roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines'\nblue dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's. But it makes them\ngiddy to look so they pull up their skirts...\nTHOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES\n\u2014Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We're in the\narchdiocese here.\n\u2014And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue\nof the onehandled adulterer.\n\u2014Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the\nidea. I see what you mean.\nDAMES DONATE DUBLIN'S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF\n\u2014It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too\ntired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between\nthem and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with\ntheir handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and\nspitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.\nHe gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O'Madden\nBurke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney's.\n\u2014Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.",

He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?\n\u2014Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.\n\u2014Hello, Flynn.\n\u2014How's things?\n\u2014Tiptop... Let me see. I'll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.\nSardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham\nand his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is\nhome without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad!\nUnder the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam's\npotted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too\nsalty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of\nhonour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch\nthe effect. _There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something\nthe somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger_. With it an abode of\nbliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked\nand minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together.\nHygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of\ninside. Peace and war depend on some fellow's digestion. Religions.\nChristmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be\nmerry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all\nbut itself. Mity cheese.\n\u2014Have you a cheese sandwich?\n\u2014Yes, sir.\nLike a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of\nburgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,\nTom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served\nme that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God\nmade food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.\n\u2014Wife well?\n\u2014Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?\n\u2014Yes, sir.\nNosey Flynn sipped his grog.\n\u2014Doing any singing those times?\nLook at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.\nMusic. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him.\nDoes no harm. Free ad.\n\u2014She's engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard\nperhaps.\n\u2014No. O, that's the style. Who's getting it up?\nThe curate served.\n\u2014How much is that?\n\u2014Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.\nMr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. _Mr MacTrigger_. Easier\nthan the dreamy creamy stuff. _His five hundred wives. Had the time of\ntheir lives._\n\u2014Mustard, sir?\n\u2014Thank you.\nHe studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. _Their lives_. I have\nit. _It grew bigger and bigger and bigger_.\n\u2014Getting it up? he said. Well, it's like a company idea, you see. Part\nshares and part profits.\n\u2014Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket\nto scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn't Blazes Boylan\nmixed up in it?\nA warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom's heart. He\nraised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock\nfive minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.\nHis midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,\nlongingly.\nWine.\nHe smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to\nspeed it, set his wineglass delicately down.\n\u2014Yes, he said. He's the organiser in point of fact.\nNo fear: no brains.\nNosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.\n\u2014He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that\nboxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello\nbarracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he\nwas telling me...\nHope that dewdrop doesn't come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.\n\u2014For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God\ntill further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is\na hairy chap.\nDavy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,\ncleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose\nsmile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat\non the parsnips.\n\u2014And here's himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give\nus a good one for the Gold cup?\n\u2014I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a\nhorse.\n\u2014You're right there, Nosey Flynn said.\nMr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of\ndisgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his\nwine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather\nwith the chill off.\nNice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like\nthe way it curves there.\n\u2014I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined\nmany a man, the same horses.\nVintners' sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits\nfor consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.\n\u2014True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's no\nstraight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He's giving\nSceptre today. Zinfandel's the favourite, Lord Howard de Walden's, won\nat Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one\nagainst Saint Amant a fortnight before.\n\u2014That so? Davy Byrne said...\nHe went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned\nits pages.\n\u2014I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of\nhorseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,\nRothschild's filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow\ncap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off\nit. Ay.\nHe drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the\nflutes.\n\u2014Ay, he said, sighing.\nMr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull.\nWill I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him\nforget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down\nagain. Cold nose he'd have kissing a woman. Still they might like.\nPrickly beards they like. Dogs' cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the\nrumbling stomach's Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling\nhim in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!\nWine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish\ncheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I'm not thirsty. Bath\nof course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o'clock I can.\nSix. Six. Time will be gone then. She...\nMild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off\ncolour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy\nlobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of\nshells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the\nFrench eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn\nnothing in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything\ninto your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you\nthink good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so\non. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting\nfruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need\nartificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters.\nUnsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too.\nWho found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank\noysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this\nmorning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed\nno June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high.\nTainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs\nfifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each\ndish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That\narchduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs?\nOr who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch\nin town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the\nfashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half\nthe catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price.\nCheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses.\nSwell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The _\u00e9lite. Cr\u00e8me de\nla cr\u00e8me_. They want special dishes to pretend they're. Hermit with a\nplatter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat\nwith me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to\nvenisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow.\nSpread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted\n_chef_ like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage _\u00e0 la duchesse de\nParme_. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know\nwhat you've eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself.\nDosing it with Edwards' desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them.\nLobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn't mind being a\nwaiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I\ntempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do\nbedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat\nlived in Killiney, I remember. _Du de la_ is French. Still it's the\nsame fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out\nof making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills can't write his\nname on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth\ntwisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth\nfifty thousand pounds.\nStuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.\nGlowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the\nwinepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch\ntelling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under\nwild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The\nbay purple by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards\nSutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried\ncities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather\nscrub my hand under her nape, you'll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft\nwith ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not\nturn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her\nmouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and\nchewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.\nJoy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft\nwarm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing\neyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth\nrhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants.\nScreened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her,\nkissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts\nfull in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued\nher. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair.\nKissed, she kissed me.\nMe. And me now.\nStuck, the flies buzzed.\nHis downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.\nBeauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno:\ncurves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the\nround hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don't care what\nman looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like\nFlynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?\nMortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods\ngolden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled\nmutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it\ndrinking electricity: gods' food. Lovely forms of women sculped\nJunonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out\nbehind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like\nstoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I'll look today. Keeper\nwon't see. Bend down let something fall see if she.\nDribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do\nthere to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and\nwalked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men\nlovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.\nWhen the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:\n\u2014What is this he is? Isn't he in the insurance line?\n\u2014He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for\nthe _Freeman._\n\u2014I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?\n\u2014Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?\n\u2014I noticed he was in mourning.\n\u2014Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at\nhome. You're right, by God. So he was.\n\u2014I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a\ngentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their\nminds.\n\u2014It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before\nyesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's\nwife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home\nto his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.\n\u2014And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.\nNosey Flynn pursed his lips.\n\u2014He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of\nthat.\n\u2014How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.\nNosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He\nwinked.\n\u2014He's in the craft, he said.\n\u2014Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.\n\u2014Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He's\nan excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg\nup. I was told that by a\u2014well, I won't say who.\n\u2014Is that a fact?\n\u2014O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you're\ndown. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they're as close\nas damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.\nDavy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:\n\u2014Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!\n\u2014There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find\nout what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and\nswore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint\nLegers of Doneraile.\nDavy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:\n\u2014And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here\nand I never once saw him\u2014you know, over the line.\n\u2014God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips\noff when the fun gets too hot. Didn't you see him look at his watch?\nAh, you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he\ndoes he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to\nGod he does.\n\u2014There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He's a safe man, I'd say.\n\u2014He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He's been known\nto put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O,\nBloom has his good points. But there's one thing he'll never do.\nHis hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.\n\u2014I know, Davy Byrne said.\n\u2014Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.\nPaddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning,\na plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.\n\u2014Day, Mr Byrne.\n\u2014Day, gentlemen.\nThey paused at the counter.\n\u2014Who's standing? Paddy Leonard asked.\n\u2014I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.\n\u2014Well, what'll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.\n\u2014I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.\n\u2014How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God' sake? What's\nyours, Tom?\n\u2014How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.\nFor answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and\nhiccupped.\n\u2014Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.\n\u2014Certainly, sir.\nPaddy Leonard eyed his alemates.\n\u2014Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I'm standing drinks to! Cold\nwater and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.\nHe has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.\n\u2014Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.\nTom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set\nbefore him.\n\u2014That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.\n\u2014Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.\nTom Rochford nodded and drank.\n\u2014Is it Zinfandel?\n\u2014Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I'm going to plunge five bob on my\nown.\n\u2014Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard\nsaid. Who gave it to you?\nMr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.\n\u2014So long! Nosey Flynn said.\nThe others turned.\n\u2014That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.\n\u2014Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two\nof your small Jamesons after that and a...\n\u2014Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.\n\u2014Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.\nMr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth\nsmooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with\nthose R\u00f6ntgen rays searchlight you could.\nAt Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the\ncobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks\nhaving fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom\ncoasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they\nmove. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of\nhis? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. Lean people long\nmouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and\ninvent free. Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering.\nHe hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:\nDon Giovanni, a cenar teco\nM'invitasti.\nFeel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap\nin the blues. Dutch courage. That _Kilkenny People_ in the national\nlibrary now I must.\nBare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller,\nplumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way\ndown, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour\nround the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric\njuice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to\nstand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.\n\u2014_A cenar teco._\nWhat does that _teco_ mean? Tonight perhaps.\nDon Giovanni, thou hast me invited\nTo come to supper tonight,\nThe rum the rumdum.\nDoesn't go properly.\nKeyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That'll be two pounds ten about\ntwo pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott's dyeworks\nvan over there. If I get Billy Prescott's ad: two fifteen. Five guineas\nabout. On the pig's back.\nCould buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new\ngarters.\nToday. Today. Not think.\nTour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,\nMargate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely\nseaside girls. Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy\nthought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages.\nWill eat anything.\nMr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and\npassed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. _Why I left the\nchurch of Rome? Birds' Nest._ Women run him. They say they used to give\npauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato\nblight. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor\njews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.\nA blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No\ntram in sight. Wants to cross.\n\u2014Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.\nThe blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He\nmoved his head uncertainly.\n\u2014You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.\nDo you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.\nThe cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its\nline and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I\nsaw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in\nJohn Long's. Slaking his drouth.\n\u2014There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see you\nacross. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?\n\u2014Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.\n\u2014Come, Mr Bloom said.\nHe touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to\nguide it forward.\nSay something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust\nwhat you tell them. Pass a common remark.\n\u2014The rain kept off.\nNo answer.\nStains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different\nfor him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like\nMilly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if\nhe has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired\ndrudge get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a\nhorse.\n\u2014Thanks, sir.\nKnows I'm a man. Voice.\n\u2014Right now? First turn to the left.\nThe blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing\nhis cane back, feeling again.\nMr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone\ntweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?\nMust have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense\nof volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.\nWonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer\nidea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could\nhe walk in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face like\na fellow going in to be a priest.\nPenrose! That was that chap's name.\nLook at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.\nTune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a\ndeformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might\nsay. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets.\nPeople ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday.\nHates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.\nSense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched\ntogether. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the\nspring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with\nyour eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say\nget no pleasure.\nAnd with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl\npassing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have\nthem all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his\nmind's eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his\nfingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,\nfor instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.\nThen passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of\nwhite.\nPostoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two\nshillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just\nhere too. Wait. Think over it.\nWith a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above\nhis ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt\nthe skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.\nThe belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick\nstreet. Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling\nmy braces.\nWalking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat\nand trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of\nhis belly. But I know it's whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to\nsee.\nHe withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.\nPoor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would\nhe have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being\nborn that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned\nand drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration\nfor sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.\nDear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can't cotton on to\nthem someway.\nSir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons' hall. Solemn as Troy.\nAfter his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a\nmagnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat\nschool. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he'd turn up his nose\nat that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a\ndusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder's court.\nWellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their\npercentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil\non moneylenders. Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling. Now he's really\nwhat they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers\nin wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your\nsoul.\nHello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant.\nSixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer's hospital. _The\nMessiah_ was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out\nthere: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a\nleech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.\nMr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.\nStraw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.\nHis heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved\nto the right.\nIs it? Almost certain. Won't look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too\nheady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.\nMaking for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.\nHandsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?\nDidn't see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.\nThe flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold\nstatues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.\nNo. Didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate.\nMy heart!\nHis eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir\nThomas Deane was the Greek architecture.\nLook for something I.\nHis hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded\nAgendath Netaim. Where did I?\nBusy looking.\nHe thrust back quick Agendath.\nAfternoon she said.\nI am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. _Freeman._\nWhere did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?\nHurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.\nHis hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap\nlotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.\nSafe!",

She\nbore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids\nclosed when he lay on his deathbed.\nMother's deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this\nworld lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. _Liliata\nrutilantium._\nI wept alone.\nJohn Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.\n\u2014The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got\nout of it as quickly and as best he could.\n\u2014Bosh!

His\nerrors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.\nPortals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,\nsoftcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.\n\u2014A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of\ndiscovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn\nfrom Xanthippe?\n\u2014Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts\ninto the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit\nnomen!_), Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever\nknow. But neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him\nfrom the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.\n\u2014But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem\nto be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.\nHis look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to\nchide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard,\nguiltless though maligned.\n\u2014He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.\nHe carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling\n_The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we\nshould know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of\nhounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, _Venus\nand Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is\nKatharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and\nbeautiful. Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a\npassionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose\nthe ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her\nand gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy.\nTheir life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He\nwas chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way.\nBy cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and\ntwentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping\nto conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford\nwench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.\nAnd my turn?

            "text": "The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S. J. reset his smooth\nwatch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five\nto three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name\nagain? Dignam. Yes. _Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the\nperson to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible.\nGood practical catholic: useful at mission time.\nA onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his\ncrutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the\nsisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very\nreverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his\npurse held, he knew, one silver crown.\nFather Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,\nof soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,\nending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words:\n_If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have\nabandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of\nsunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy\nM.P.\n\u2014Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?\nFather Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton\nprobably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at\nBelvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear\nthat. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still\nsitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful\nindeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would\ncome again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man\nreally.\nFather Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.\nIooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.\nYes, he would certainly call.\n\u2014Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.\nFather Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the\njet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,\nin going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\nFather Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father\nBernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.\n\u2014Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?\nA zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his\nway. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.\nOf good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?\nO, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.\nFather Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy\nsquare. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were\nthey good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his\nname? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little\nman? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.\nFather Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and\npointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.\n\u2014But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.\nThe boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:\n\u2014O, sir.\n\u2014Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.\nMaster Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter\nto father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father\nConmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square\neast.\nMr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate\nfrockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender\ntrousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave\ndeportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady\nMaxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.\nWas that not Mrs M'Guinness?\nMrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the\nfarther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and\nsaluted. How did she do?\nA fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to\nthink that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he\nsay?... such a queenly mien.\nFather Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the\nshutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will\n(D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on\nhim to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible\nignorance. They acted according to their lights.\nFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular\nroad. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an\nimportant thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.\nA band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All\nraised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.\nChristian brother boys.\nFather Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint\nJoseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father\nConmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but\noccasionally they were also badtempered.\nNear Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift\nnobleman. And now it was an office or something.\nFather Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted\nby Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father\nConmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came\nfrom baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the\nTobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful\ncatastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually\nhappening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an\nact of perfect contrition.\nFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of\nwhich two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.\nFather Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny\nKelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.\nA constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted\nthe constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee\nobserved pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in\ntubes.\nMoored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a\nturfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty\nstraw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above\nhim. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of\nthe Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out\nand bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor\npeople.\nOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis\nXavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound\ntram.\nOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of\nsaint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.\nAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for\nhe disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.\nFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with\ncare in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a\nsixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into\nhis purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket\ninspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away\nthe ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father\nConmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked\ncheerful decorum.\nIt was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father\nConmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee\nsupposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman\nwith the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so\ngently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and\nsmiled tinily, sweetly.\nFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that\nthe awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the\nseat.\nFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the\nmouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.\nAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old\nwoman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the\nbellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a\nmarketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and\nbasket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed\nthe end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had\nalways to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been\nabsolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many\ncares, poor creatures.\nFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at\nFather Conmee.\nFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men\nand of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission\nand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and\nbrown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when\ntheir last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the\nBelgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des \u00c9lus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a\nreasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in\nHis Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But\nthey were God's souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a\npity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.\nAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the\nconductor and saluted in his turn.\nThe Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.\nThe joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,\nimmediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.\nThen came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.\nThose were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old\ntimes in the barony.\nFather Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the\nBarony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and\nof Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of\nBelvedere.\nA listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,\nMary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,\nnot startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the\njealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed\nadultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with\nher husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned\nas women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.\nFather Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however\nfor man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our\nways.\nDon John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and\nhonoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at\nsmiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit\nclusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,\nwere impalmed by Don John Conmee.\nIt was a charming day.\nThe lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,\ncurtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of\nsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind. _Moutonner,_ the French\nsaid. A just and homely word.\nFather Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds\nover Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of\nClongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the\ncries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet\nevening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.\nFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.\nAn ivory bookmark told him the page.\nNones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had\ncome.\nFather Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.\n_Deus in adiutorium._\nHe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he",

            "text": "Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's,\ncarrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.\n\u2014There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said\neagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord\nmayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan\nDawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin\nDollard...\n\u2014I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.\n\u2014Did she? Lenehan said.\nA card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number\n7 Eccles street.\nHe checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the\ncatering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife\nwere there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and\ncuracoa to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After\nliquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...\n\u2014I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...\nLenehan linked his arm warmly.\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after\nall the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the\nmorning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's\nnight on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one\nside of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started\nsinging glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_. She was well\nprimed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every\njolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's\ndelights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.\nHe held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:\n\u2014I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.\nKnow what I mean?\nHis hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in\ndelight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.\n\u2014The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey\nmare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the\ncomets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear\nand Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I\nwas lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At\nlast she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. _And what star is that,\nPoldy?_ says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. _That one, is it?_\nsays Chris Callinan, _sure that's only what you might call a pinprick._\nBy God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.\nLenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft\nlaughter.\n\u2014I'm weak, he gasped.\nM'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan\nwalked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead\nrapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.\n\u2014He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one\nof your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist\nabout old Bloom.\n* * *\nMr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria\nMonk_, then of Aristotle's _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print.\nPlates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of\nslaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the\nworld. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every\nminute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.\nHe laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the\nGhetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.\n\u2014That I had, he said, pushing it by.\nThe shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.\n\u2014Them are two good ones, he said.\nOnions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.\nHe bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his\nunbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.\nOn O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay\napparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.\nMr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. _Fair Tyrants_ by James\nLovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.\nHe opened it. Thought so.\nA woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.\nNo: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.\nHe read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_. More in her line. Let us see.\nHe read where his finger opened.\n_\u2014All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on\nwondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!_\nYes. This. Here. Try.\n\u2014_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands\nfelt for the opulent curves inside her d\u00e9shabill\u00e9._\nYes. Take this. The end.\n\u2014You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.\nThe beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her\nqueenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played\nround her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.\nMr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._\nWarmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply\namid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched\nthemselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul!_).\nArmpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).\nFeel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!\nYoung! Young!\nAn elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of\nchancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the\nlord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the\nadmiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the\nLady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of\nappeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean\nAccident and Guarantee Corporation.\nPhlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy\ncurtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven\nreddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on\nthe floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along\nit, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.\nMr Bloom beheld it.\nMastering his troubled breath, he said:\n\u2014I'll take this one.\nThe shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.\n\u2014_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.\n* * *\nThe lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell\ntwice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.\nDilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,\nthe cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely\ncurtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas.\nAny advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.\nThe lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:\n\u2014Barang!\nBang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.\nJ. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched\nnecks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.\nMr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row.\nHe halted near his daughter.\n\u2014It's time for you, she said.\n\u2014Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are\nyou trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon\nshoulder? Melancholy God!\nDilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and\nheld them back.\n\u2014Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine.\nDo you know what you look like?\nHe let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders\nand dropping his underjaw.\n\u2014Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.\nMr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.\n\u2014Did you get any money? Dilly asked.\n\u2014Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin\nwould lend me fourpence.\n\u2014You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.\n\u2014How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.\nMr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along\nJames's street.\n\u2014I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?\n\u2014I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns\ntaught you to be so saucy? Here.\nHe handed her a shilling.\n\u2014See if you can do anything with that, he said.\n\u2014I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.\n\u2014Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of\nthem, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor\nmother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long\nday from me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't\ncare if I was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.\nHe left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.\n\u2014Well, what is it? he said, stopping.\nThe lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.\n\u2014Barang!\n\u2014Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.\nThe lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell\nbut feebly:\n\u2014Bang!\nMr Dedalus stared at him.\n\u2014Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to\ntalk.\n\u2014You got more than that, father, Dilly said.\n\u2014I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you\nall where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got two\nshillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the\nfuneral.\nHe drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.\n\u2014Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.\nMr Dedalus thought and nodded.\n\u2014I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell\nstreet. I'll try this one now.\n\u2014You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.\n\u2014Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk\nfor yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.\nHe put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.\nThe viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of\nParkgate.\n\u2014I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.\nThe lacquey banged loudly.\nMr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing\nmincing mouth gently:\n\u2014The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do\nanything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!\n* * *\nFrom the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with\nthe order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's\nstreet, past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you\ndo, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your\nother establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping\nalive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country.\nThose farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your\nbest gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that\n_General Slocum_ explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.\nAnd heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most\nbrutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion.\nMost scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the\nfirehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever\nallowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins.\nYou know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look\nat that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we\nwere bad here.\nI smiled at him. _America,_ I said quietly, just like that. _What is\nit? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true?_\nThat's a fact.\nGraft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's\nalways someone to pick it up.\nSaw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy\nappearance. Bowls them over.\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\nMr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter\nKennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson\nstreet. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built\nunder three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street\nclub toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian\nbank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he\nremembered me.\nAham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.\nGentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom\nagain, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying\nhas it.\nNorth wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains,\nsailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on\nthe ferrywash, Elijah is coming.\nMr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.\nGrizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy\nbody forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned\nLambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn\nit. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash\nlike that. Damn like him.\nAham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.\nGood drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to\nhis fat strut.\nDown there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope.\nDogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife\ndrove by in her noddy.\nBad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too.\nFourbottle men.\nLet me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight\nburial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the\nwall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn\ndown here. Make a detour.\nMr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the\ncorner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin\nDistillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey\nstood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some\nTipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway\nhorse.\nDenis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John\nHenry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for\nthe office of Messrs Collis and Ward.\nMr Kernan approached Island street.\nTimes of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those\nreminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now\nin a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No\ncardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the\ntable by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from\nmajor Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.\nDamn good gin that was.\nFine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that\nsham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on\nthe wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is:\nIngram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad\ntouchingly. Masterly rendition.\n_At the siege of Ross did my father fall._\nA cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,\nleaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.\nMr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.\nHis Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a\npity!\n* * *\nStephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's\nfingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the\nshowtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.\nDust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on\nrubies, leprous and winedark stones.\nBorn all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights\nshining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of\ntheir brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest\nthem.\nShe dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman,\nrustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed\nsilent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her\nhips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.\nOld Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned\nit and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape\ngloating on a stolen hoard.\nAnd you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words\nof sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat\nstanding from everlasting to everlasting.\nTwo old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through\nIrishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,\none with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.\nThe whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the\npowerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always\nwithout you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I\nbetween them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.\nShatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me\nyou who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A\nlook around.\nYes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You\nsay right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.\nStephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against\nhis shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan\nboxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood\nround the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths\nproposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are\nthrobbing: heroes' hearts.\nHe turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.\n\u2014Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.\nTattered pages. _The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Cur\u00e9 of\nArs. Pocket Guide to Killarney._\nI might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. _Stephano Dedalo,\nalumno optimo, palmam ferenti._\nFather Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet\nof Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.\nBinding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of\nMoses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read\nand read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands.\nRecipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this.\nSay the following talisman three times with hands folded:\n\u2014_Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._\nWho wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter\nSalanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's\ncharms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your\nwool.\n\u2014What are you doing here, Stephen?\nDilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.\nShut the book quick. Don't let see.\n\u2014What are you doing? Stephen said.\nA Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It\nglowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her\nof Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a\npinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. _Nebrakada femininum._\n\u2014What have you there? Stephen asked.\n\u2014I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing\nnervously. Is it any good?\nMy eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.\nShadow of my mind.\nHe took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.\n\u2014What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?\nShe nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.\nShow no surprise. Quite natural.\n\u2014Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you.\nI suppose all my books are gone.\n\u2014Some, Dilly said. We had to.\nShe is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will\ndrown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,\nmy heart, my soul. Salt green death.\nWe.\nAgenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.\nMisery! Misery!\n* * *\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\nThey clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley\nbrushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.\n\u2014What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.\n\u2014Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with\ntwo men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.\n\u2014Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?\n\u2014O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.\n\u2014With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\u2014The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just\nwaiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get\nhim to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.\nHe looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in\nhis neck.\n\u2014I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always\ndoing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!\nHe put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.\n\u2014There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.\nBen Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops\ncrossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards\nthem at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.\nAs he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:\n\u2014Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.\n\u2014Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.\nMr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben\nDollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he\nmuttered sneeringly:\n\u2014That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?\n\u2014Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I\nthrew out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.\nHe stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes\nfrom points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:\n\u2014They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.\n\u2014Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to\nGod he's not paid yet.\n\u2014And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.\nCashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,\nglassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.\nBen Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth\na deep note.\n\u2014Aw! he said.\n\u2014That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.\n\u2014What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?\nHe turned to both.\n\u2014That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.\nThe reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint\nMary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by\nGeraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of\nhurdles.\nBen Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,\nhis joyful fingers in the air.\n\u2014Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to show\nyou the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between\nLobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along.\nI saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will\ncost me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay,\nBob, believe you me.\n\u2014For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.\nBen Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button\nof his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the\nheavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.\n\u2014What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?\n\u2014He has, Father Cowley said.\n\u2014Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben\nDollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the\nparticulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?\n\u2014That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a\nminister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?\n\u2014You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that\nwrit where Jacko put the nuts.\nHe led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.\n\u2014Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his\nglasses on his coatfront, following them.\n* * *\n\u2014The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they\npassed out of the Castleyard gate.\nThe policeman touched his forehead.\n\u2014God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.\nHe signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on\ntowards Lord Edward street.\nBronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared\nabove the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.\n\u2014Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father\nConmee and laid the whole case before him.\n\u2014You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.\n\u2014Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.\nJohn Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them\nquickly down Cork hill.\nOn the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed\nAlderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.\nThe castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.\n\u2014Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_\noffice. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.\n\u2014Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the\nfive shillings too.\n\u2014Without a second word either, Mr Power said.\n\u2014Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.\nJohn Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.\n\u2014I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.\nThey went down Parliament street.\n\u2014There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.\n\u2014Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.\nOutside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's\nbrother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.\nJohn Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took\nthe elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked\nuncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.\n\u2014The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John\nWyse Nolan told Mr Power.\nThey followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The\nempty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham,\nspeaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not\nglance.\n\u2014And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as\nlife.\nThe tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.\n\u2014Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and\ngreeted.\nLong John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay\ndecisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all\ntheir faces.\n\u2014Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he\nsaid with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.\nHell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,\nabout their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to\nknow, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the\nmacebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,\nno quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little\nLorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him. Damned Irish language,\nlanguage of our forefathers.\nLong John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.\nMartin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to\nthe assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held\nhis peace.\n\u2014What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.\nJimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.\n\u2014O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake\ntill I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!\nTestily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and\npassed in and up the stairs.\n\u2014Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think\nyou knew him or perhaps you did, though.\nWith John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.\n\u2014Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long\nJohn Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.\n\u2014Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham\nsaid.\nLong John Fanning could not remember him.\nClatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.\n\u2014What's that? Martin Cunningham said.\nAll turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the\ncool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,\nharness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went\npast before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the\nleaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.\n\u2014What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the\nstaircase.\n\u2014The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse\nNolan answered from the stairfoot.\n* * *\nAs they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his\nPanama to Haines:\n\u2014Parnell's brother. There in the corner.\nThey chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man\nwhose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.\n\u2014Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.\n\u2014Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.\nJohn Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw\nwent up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after,\nunder its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and\nfell once more upon a working corner.\n\u2014I'll take a _m\u00e9lange,_ Haines said to the waitress.\n\u2014Two _m\u00e9langes,_ Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and\nbutter and some cakes as well.\nWhen she had gone he said, laughing:\n\u2014We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed\nDedalus on _Hamlet._\nHaines opened his newbought book.\n\u2014I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all\nminds that have lost their balance.\nThe onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:\n\u2014_England expects_...\nBuck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.\n\u2014You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.\nWandering \u00c6ngus I call him.\n\u2014I am sure he has an _id\u00e9e fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin\nthoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it\nwould be likely to be. Such persons always have.\nBuck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.\n\u2014They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never\ncapture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white\ndeath and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.\nThe joy of creation...\n\u2014Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him\nthis morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's\nrather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an\ninteresting point out of that.\nBuck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to\nunload her tray.\n\u2014He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid\nthe cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,\nof retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.\nDoes he write anything for your movement?\nHe sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.\nBuck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over\nits smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.\n\u2014Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write\nsomething in ten years.\n\u2014Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.\nStill, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.\nHe tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.\n\u2014This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't\nwant to be imposed on.\nElijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of\nships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping\nstreet past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_\nfrom Bridgwater with bricks.\n* * *\nAlmidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind\nhim Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with\nstickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's\nhouse and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him\na blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.\nCashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr\nLewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along\nMerrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.\nAt the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name\nannounced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of\nduke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth\nbared he muttered:\n\u2014_Coactus volui._\nHe strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.\nAs he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat\nbrushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,\nhaving buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly\nface after the striding form.\n\u2014God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder\nnor I am, you bitch's bastard!\n* * *\nOpposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the\npound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been\nsent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming\ndull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs\nMacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping\nsups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's.\nAnd they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole\nblooming time and sighing.\nAfter Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,\nstopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their\npelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning\nMasters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will\nmeet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of\nfifty sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler\nKeogh, that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar\nentrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master\nDignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is\nit? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He\nturned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap\nawry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he\nsaw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two\npuckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer\nsmokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found\nout.\nMaster Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going\nfor strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow\nwould knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker\nfor science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out\nof him, dodging and all.\nIn Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and\na swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was\ntelling him and grinning all the time.\nNo Sandymount tram.\nMaster Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his\nother hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The\nblooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming\nend to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow\neither, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice\nI'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight.\nThen they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's\nname.\nHis face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a\nfly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were\nscrewing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were\nbringing it downstairs.\nPa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling\nthe men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and\nheavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was\nstanding on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to\nTunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.\nNever see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He\ntold me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he\nsaid but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor\npa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because\nhe went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.",

            "text": "William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by\nlieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the\nviceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs\nPaget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. in\nattendance.\nThe cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by\nobsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern\nquays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the\nmetropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted\nhim vainly from afar. Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord\nDudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley\nWhite, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's,\nthe pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose\nwith his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough\nmore quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot\nthrough Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the\nporch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,\nCollis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the\ndoorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the\nPatriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed\nher plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously\non the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall\nunder Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of\nliquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by\nbronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired.\nOn Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse\nfor the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his\nhat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From\nCahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M. A., made obeisance\nunperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held\nof yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking\nleave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger\nGreene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,\ncarrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid\nup, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she\ncouldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's\nbig yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its\nbeing the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of\nKavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness\ntowards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The\nRight Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed\nMicky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax\nsmartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_\nJames. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the\napproach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley\nfixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret\nwaistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming _soubrette,_ great\nMarie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from\nher poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon\nlieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald\nWard A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and\nHaines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders\nof eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon\nJohn Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus,\nstraining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw\nsunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry\nMenton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from\nwinebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in\nhis fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's\nhorse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from\nunder the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings.\nUnderstanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the\nsecond carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably\nsurprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white\nflagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him,\nE.L.Y.'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's\nmusic warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily\napparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By\nthe provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes\nand socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl's a Yorkshire\ngirl._\nBlazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high\naction a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a\nsuit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute\nbut he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and\nthe red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His\nExcellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of\nmusic which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen\nhighland laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cort\u00e8ge_:\nBut though she's a factory lass\nAnd wears no fancy clothes.\nBaraabum.\nYet I've a sort of a\nYorkshire relish for\nMy little Yorkshire rose.\nBaraabum.\nThither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.\nShrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F.\nStevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding\npast Finn's hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell\nstared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr\nM. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate.\nDeep in Leinster street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man,\nHornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by\nMerrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes\nbeing given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black\ncap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up.\nThe viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds\nfor Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount\nstreet. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower\nMount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread,\npassed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal\nCanal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips\nagrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road\ncorner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in\nwhich eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady\nmayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne\nroads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male\nwalkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the\nhouse said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the\nIrish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the\nsalute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing\ndoor.",

One flat.\nThe keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.\nUp stage strode Father Cowley.\n\u2014Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.\nBy Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged.\nSteak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom\nand Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.\nMost beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He\nheard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way.\nChoirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.\nNever forget it. Never.\nTenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.\nBackache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying\nthe piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off\nawhile. Sings too: _Down among the dead men._ Appropriate. Kidney pie.\nSweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in.\nCharacteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the\nglass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then\nsquander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a\nfarthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.\nNever would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In\nthe gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.\nSpeech paused on Richie's lips.\nComing out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all. Believes his\nown lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.\n\u2014Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.\n\u2014_All is lost now_.\nRichie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee\nmurmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth\nhe's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two\nnotes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my\nmotives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in\nall. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now.\nMournful he whistled.

Yes: all is lost.\n\u2014A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.\nNever in all his life had Richie Goulding.\nHe knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise\nchild that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?\nBloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking\nRichie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his\neye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I\ndid sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.\nPiano again. Sounds better than last time I heard.

Pat, waiter, waited,\nwaiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.\n\u2014_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._\nThrough the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves\nin murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem\ndulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their\neach his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each\nseemed to from both depart when first they heard.

Bloom\nwound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound\nit round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.\n\u2014_Full of hope and all delighted_...\nTenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his\nfeet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He\ncan't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him.\nWhat perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last\nlook at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How\ndo you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,\nin her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.\nAlas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.\n\u2014_But alas, 'twas idle dreaming_...\nGlorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly\nman! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his\nwife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he\ndoesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing\ntoo. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind\nsoup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.\nTenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the\nchat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.\nWords? Music?

How strange! Today.\nThe voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to\nRichie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to\nwait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,\nhow look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.\nWish I could see his face, though. Explain better.

            "text": "The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious\nembrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of\nall too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud\npromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on\nthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on\nthe quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the\nstillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a\nbeacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\nThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening\nscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and\noft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy\nchat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy\nCaffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and\nJacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits\nwith caps to match and the name _H. M. S. Belleisle_ printed on both.\nFor Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very\nnoisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little\nfellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They\nwere dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building\ncastles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy\nas the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to\nand fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with\ndelight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a\ntiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy\nCaffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty\ndimple in his chin.\n\u2014Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of\nwater.\nAnd baby prattled after her:\n\u2014A jink a jink a jawbo.\nCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of\nchildren, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could\nnever be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that\nheld his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown\nbread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But\nto be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in\nhis new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,\nwas Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life,\nalways with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her\ncherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman\nlaughed too at the quaint language of little brother.\nBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and\nMaster Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to\nthis golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand\nwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go\nwrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like\nthe Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky\nwas selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's\nhouse is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose\nthat the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the\ncoveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master\nTommy drew the attention of the girl friends.\n\u2014Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,\nJacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I\ncatch you for that.\nHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for\ntheir big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he\nwas too after his misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and\nunmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the\nart of smoothing over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one\nspeck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue\neyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed\naway the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and\nsaid if she was near him she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing\nin admonition.\n\u2014Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\nShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\n\u2014What's your name? Butter and cream?\n\u2014Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your\nsweetheart?\n\u2014Nao, tearful Tommy said.\n\u2014Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said.\n\u2014I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from\nher shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy's sweetheart. Gerty is\nTommy's sweetheart.\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\nCissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy\nBoardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman\ncouldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.\nBut who was Gerty?\nGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,\ngazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a\nspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was\npronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said,\nshe was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and\ngraceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had\nbeen taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the\nWidow Welch's female pills and she was much better of those discharges\nshe used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face\nwas almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth\nwas a genuine Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely\nveined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and\nqueen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used\nto wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple\ntold that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black\nout at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their\nlittle tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told\nher not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or\nshe'd never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There\nwas an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which\nwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.\nHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in\nher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education\nGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the\nland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow\nand patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their\ndevoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that\nlent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed\nmeaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful\neyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery?\nGerty's were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and\ndark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily\nseductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful\npage of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try\neyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so\nbecoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then\nthere was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase\nyour height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would\nsuit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning\nglory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a\nnatural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the\nnew moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of\nluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And\njust now at Edy's words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest\nrosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet\ngirlish shyness that of a surety God's fair land of Ireland did not\nhold her equal.\nFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was\nabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.\nInclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.\nThe pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out\ninto a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young\nMay morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy\nsay that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a\nlovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about\nthe boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding\nup and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in\nthe evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate\nthat was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a\ndoctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who\nwas racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little\nrecked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart\nsometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he\nmight learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family\nand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed\nVirgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an\nexquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the\nshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would\nknow anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the\nbicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice\nperfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size\ntoo he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so\nfrightfully clever because he didn't go and ride up and down in front\nof her bit of a garden.\nGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of\nDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be\nout. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because\nit was expected in the _Lady's Pictorial_ that electric blue would be\nworn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket\n(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her\nfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy\nthreequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful\nfigure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of\nwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue\nchenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday\nweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she\nfound what she wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly\nshopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.\nShe did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on\nthen, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to\nher! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew\nthat that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes\nwere the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she\nwas very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a\nfive, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one\nsmart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed\nits perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount\nand no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with\nhighspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's\nchief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet\nseventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in\nhis heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty\nstitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with\ndifferent coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen,\nand she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the\nwash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because\nshe wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching\nthe things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her\nown colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on\nher because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his\nfather brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and\nbecause she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was\ndressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside\nout and that was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things\non inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so\nlong as it wasn't of a Friday.\nAnd yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is\nthere all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give\nworlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving\nway to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings\nthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the\nmirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls\nupon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.\nYes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage\nhas been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.\nC. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs\nWylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was\nwearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox\nwas not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in\nlove, a woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer's\n(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an\narm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her\nlittle one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the\nfirst!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from\nthe room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength\nof character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would\nwoo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting,\nalways waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be\nover. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous\nlove at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who\nhad not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,\nand who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her\nto him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort\nher with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she\nyearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be\nhis only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in\nhealth, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.\nAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was\njust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his\nlittle wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue\nin the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she\nwould be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature\ncomforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked\nthat feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue\nand queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden\nopinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a\nfire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same\ndirection, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of\neggs though she didn't like the eating part when there were any people\nthat made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something\npoetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully\nappointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph\nof grandpapa Giltrap's lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was\nso human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in\nClery's summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be\ntall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a\nhusband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed\nsweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their\nhoneymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in\na nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both\nhave brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and\nbefore he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a\ngood hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.\nEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then\nshe buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run\noff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy\nsaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with\nthe ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said\nit was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if\nyou please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy\nCaffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off\nnow with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.\n\u2014You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball.\nBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her\nfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand\nand Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.\n\u2014Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.\nAnd she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played\nhere's the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread\ncarriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper\nchin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way\nlike that from everyone always petting him.\n\u2014I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't\nsay.\n\u2014On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.\nGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy\nsaying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her\nlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was\nsure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared\nCiss.\n\u2014Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of\nher nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at\nhim.\nMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.\nFor instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea\nand jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on\nher nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to\ngo where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the\nMiss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget\nher the evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the\nburned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a\ncigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was\nsincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever\nmade, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.\nAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the\npealing anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat\nconducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary,\nsermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there\ngathered together without distinction of social class (and a most\nedifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,\nafter the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the\nimmaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her\nto intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin\nof virgins. How sad to poor Gerty's ears! Had her father only avoided\nthe clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders\nthe drink habit cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in\nher carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that\nas she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp\nbecause she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window\ndreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.\nBut that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had\ncast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in\nthe home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen\nher own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself\ncompletely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it\nwas that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of\nkindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.\nAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,\nVirgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard\nher companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman\noff Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like\nhimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him\nany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\nfather because he was too old or something or on account of his face\n(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the\npimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor\nfather! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,\nMary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they\nhad stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for supper\nand when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died\nsuddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her\nmother's birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom\nand Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have\nhad a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now\nhe was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a\nwarning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the\nfuneral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him\nthe letters and samples from his office about Catesby's cork lino,\nartistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and\nalways bright and cheery in the home.\nA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the\nhouse, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in\ngold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was\nit rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't\nlike her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single\nthing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the\nworld of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas\nat the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of\nthat place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime\nMr Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days\nwhere a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a\nthreecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with\noldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a\nstory behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a\nsoft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in\nchocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them\ndreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own\narms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and\nthought about those times because she had found out in Walker's\npronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the\nhalcyon days what they meant.\nThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till\nat last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no\ngetting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he\ncould down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was\nnot slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was\nsitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted\nthe ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries\nand to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it\nto her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then\nthrew it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the\nslope and stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the\nrock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it\naway and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she\nwished their stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a\nkick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\n\u2014If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\nGerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her\npretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted\nher skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball\na jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it\ndown towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else\nto draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She\nfelt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell,\nsurging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged\nglances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she\nventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the\ntwilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had\never seen.\nThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted\nand with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain\nof original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray\nfor us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And\ncareworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many\nwho had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all\nthat bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told\nthem what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary,\nthe most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in\nany age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever\nabandoned by her.\nThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\nchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with\nbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.\nPeep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was\nCissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my\nword, didn't the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say\npapa.\n\u2014Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.\nAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for\neleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of\nhealth, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out\nto be something great, they said.\n\u2014Haja ja ja haja.\nCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to\nsit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried\nout, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half\nblanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most\nobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\n\u2014Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\nAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all\nno use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the\ngeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave\nhim in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen\nwas quickly appeased.\nGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out\nof that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little\nbrats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the\npaintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured\nchalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out,\nthe evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and\nto hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they\nburned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart\nwent pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning\nin his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her\nthrough and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were,\nsuperbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer.\nShe could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face\nthat he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin\nHarvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred\nbecause she wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they\ntwo to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see\nwhether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retrouss\u00e9_ from where he\nwas sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story\nof a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given\nworlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still,\nand he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel\nbuckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the\ntoes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the\ntransparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was\nfar away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he\nwho mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him\nbecause she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. The very\nheart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she\nknew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against\nthan sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked\nman, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could\nconvert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted\nhealing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty\ngirls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they\nhadn't got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she\ncould make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the\npast. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,\ncrushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for\nherself alone.\nRefuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. _Ora pro nobis_. Well\nhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy\ncan never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge\nfor the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her\nown heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the\nstained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue\nbanners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping\nCanon O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes\ncast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet\nand clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever\nshe became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come\nto the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time\nwhen she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots\nof her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was\nonly the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws, he\nsaid, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the\nnature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady\nherself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to\nThy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and\nthought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design\nfor him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the\nmantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little\nhouse to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the\nforty hours' adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a\npresent to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or\nsome place.\nThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky\nthrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little\nmonkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them\na good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\nthem. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they\nwere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\n\u2014Jacky! Tommy!\nNot they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very\nlast time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and\nshe ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had\na good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the\nthingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow\nlong because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat\nat it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip\nup her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a\nlot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece\nwhenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just\nbecause she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see\nall the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as\npossible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up\nover something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French\nheels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. _Tableau!_\nThat would have been a very charming expos\u00e9 for a gentleman like that\nto witness.\nQueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\nthey prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy\nhanded the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and\ncensed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and\nshe was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she\ndidn't because she thought he might be watching but she never made a\nbigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking\nthat he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed\nthe thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the\nBlessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she\njust swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to\nthe _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_. Three and eleven she paid for those\nstockings in Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday\nbefore Easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was\nlooking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had\nneither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his\nhead to see the difference for himself.\nCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\nher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a\nstreel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought\nonly a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her\npetticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a\nmoment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown\ntresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders\u2014a radiant little vision,\nin sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel\nmany a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She\ncould almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes\nthat set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she\ncould see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster\nfor her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was\neying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that\nshe had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet\nswept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a\nglorious rose.\nEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,\nhalf smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\nbaby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was\nwhy no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no\nconcern of hers. And she said to Gerty:\n\u2014A penny for your thoughts.\n\u2014What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I\nwas only wondering was it late.\nBecause she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and\ntheir babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just\ngave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy\nasked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was\nhalf past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know\nbecause they were told to be in early.\n\u2014Wait, said Cissy, I'll run ask my uncle Peter over there what's the\ntime by his conundrum.\nSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\nhand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\nwatchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was\nGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment\nhe had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and\nthe next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol\nexpressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\nCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the\nright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to\nit and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry\nhis watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the\nsun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\nmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\nCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\nhis waterworks were out of order.\nThen they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O'Hanlon\ngot up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he\ntold Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire\nto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and\nshe could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the\nworks and she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting\ndarker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was\nwinding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it\nback and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a\nsensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp\nand that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on\nbecause the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of\nthe moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her\nevery contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was\nundisguised admiration in a man's passionate gaze it was there plain to\nbe seen on that man's face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you\nknow it.\nEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty\nnoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect\nbecause it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place\nto push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied\ntheir hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon\nstood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed\nhim the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti\neis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and\nasking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just\nanswered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she\nheartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply.\nA brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn\nimmeasurable. It hurt\u2014O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet\nway of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded\nlittle cat she was. Gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but\nshe fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,\nso beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.\nShe had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle\nlike all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and\nfor an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.\nTheir eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she\nsparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them\nto see.\n\u2014O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\nflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.\nHer words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\nringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young\nvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As\nfor Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck\nhim aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as\nmuch as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a\ndozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him\none look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.\nMiss puny little Edy's countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty\ncould see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a\ntowering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft\nhad struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was\nsomething aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and\nnever would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it\nso they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\nEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked\nin the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because\nthe sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told\nhim too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and\nbaby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and\nCissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,\nwithout as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and\nsundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.\n\u2014O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.\nThe slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set\nthat little matter to rights.\nGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy\nasked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was\nflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed\nit off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction\nbecause just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet\nseashore because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that\nFather Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the\nBlessed Sacrament in his hands.\nHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse\nof Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time\na bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,\nthither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of\nthe lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of\npaints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the\nlamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church\ngrounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked\nand lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn\nhis freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss\nCummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales. For Gerty had her\ndreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a\nkeepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the\ncoralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of\nher toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was\nscrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure\ntrove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose\nscent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to\nchange when her things came home from the wash and there were some\nbeautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in\nHely's of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if\nshe could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so\ndeeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening\nround the potherbs. _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J\nWalsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt\nthou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient\nloveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the\nyears were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one\nshortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an\naccident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.\nBut it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there\nwould be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would\nmake the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his\nthoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his\ndays with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was\ndying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife\nor some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land\nof song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But\neven if\u2014what then? Would it make a very great difference? From\neverything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively\nrecoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the\naccommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and\ncoarse men with no respect for a girl's honour, degrading the sex and\nbeing taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be\njust good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other\nin spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was\nan old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She\nthought she understood. She would try to understand him because men\nwere so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white\nhands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would\nfollow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he\nwas her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was\nthe master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be\nwild, untrammelled, free.\nCanon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and\ngenuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then\nhe locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and\nFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked\nwasn't she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:\n\u2014O, look, Cissy!\nAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over\nthe trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.\n\u2014It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.\nAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,\nhelterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy\nholding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running.\n\u2014Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It's the bazaar fireworks.\nBut Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and\ncall. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she\ncould see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set\nher pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,\nand a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face,\npassion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were\nleft alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he\ncould be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of\ninflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working\nand a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the\nfireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall\nback looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she\nrevealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply\nsoft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his\nheart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of\nmen like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead\nsecret and made her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that\nwas staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had\npictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and\nshe said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine\nsometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing\nlike that because there was all the difference because she could almost\nfeel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his\nhandsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn't do\nthe other thing before being married and there ought to be women\npriests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy\nCaffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes\nso that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors'\nphotographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on\nthe way it did.\nAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned\nback and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent\nand they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was\nand she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something\nqueer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And\nshe saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in\nthe tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went\nhigher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up\nafter it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused\nwith a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see\nher other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the\nskin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,\non account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and\nthen it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was\ntrembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full\nview high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or\nwading and she wasn't ashamed and he wasn't either to look in that\nimmodest way like that because he couldn't resist the sight of the\nwondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so\nimmodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She\nwould fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms\nto him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a\nyoung girl's love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry\nthat has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot\nblind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh\nof O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a\nstream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all\ngreeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet,\nsoft!\nThen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She\nglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of\npiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.\nHe was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is\nhe) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.\nWhat a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called\nto him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he\nhad been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in\nthose eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and\nsinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That\nwas their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there\nwas none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly\nthrough the evening to and fro and little bats don't tell.\nCissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to\nshow what a great person she was: and then she cried:\n\u2014Gerty! Gerty! We're going. Come on. We can see from farther up.\nGerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She slipped a hand into\nher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of\ncourse without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too\nfar to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet\nagain, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her\ndream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their\nsouls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her\nheart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet\nflowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile,\na smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.\nSlowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,\nto Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was\ndarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and\nslippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic",

That's why she's\nleft on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was\nwrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse\nin a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn't know it when she was\non show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn't mind. Curiosity like\na nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is\ndelicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I\nhave such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all\nright. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla\nconvent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the\nend I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha,\nshe. Something in the air. That's the moon. But then why don't all\nwomen menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends\non the time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out\nof step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of\nthat. Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her\nsilly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this\nmorning. That gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife\nengagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for\nsmall mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it\nthemselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured\nout of offices. Reserve better. Don't want it they throw it at you.\nCatch em alive, O. Pity they can't see themselves. A dream of\nwellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel\nstreet: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy's hat and what the girls did\nwith it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? _Lingerie_\ndoes it. Felt for the curves inside her _d\u00e9shabill\u00e9._ Excites them also\nwhen they're. I'm all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing\none another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly's new blouse.\nAt first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her\nthe violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and\nturnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we\nmet. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman\nloses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy\nlost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part\nof their charm. Just changes when you're on the track of the secret.\nExcept the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer\nrefused. She wasn't in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they\nare. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They\nbelieve in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to\ngive her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other's\nnecks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about\nnothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs\nand their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they\ncan't get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I'll write to\nyou. Now won't you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes along,\nthen meet once in a blue moon. _Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the\nlove of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with\nyourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in\neach other's appearance. You're looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing\ntheir teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn't lend each\nother a pinch of salt.\nAh!\nDevils they are when that's coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.\nMolly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my\nfoot. O that way! O, that's exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest\nonce in a way. Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. Safe in one\nway. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering\nplants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she\nwears she's a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like\nthat you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look\nat. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and\nlions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or\nsomething. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike\nrough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me.\nWonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with\nbearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid\ngentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn't\nlet her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly\nmen marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can't be so if Molly.\nTook off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face,\nmeeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers\nto smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when\nwe were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her\nmoney. Why not? All a prejudice. She's worth ten, fifteen, more, a\npound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion.\nDid I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent\nto Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie's without a necktie. Wrangle\nwith Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he's\nanother. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four.\nDust. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was\nthat just when he, she?\nO, he did. Into her. She did. Done.\nAh!\nMr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that\nlittle limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not\npleasant. Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don't care.\nComplimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night\nprayers with the kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil\nall. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.\nThe name too. _Amours_ of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud\nBranscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered\nwith pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel.\nThe strength it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let\noff there behind the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was.\nOtherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. _Lacaus esant\ntaratara_. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you\ndon't know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask\nyou another. Good idea if you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a\ncart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she's\non for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I\nnearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath\nstreet that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of\ncourse. My arks she called it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If\nyou don't answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they\nharden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.\nParrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn't\ncalled me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a\nsingle girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman.\nOr even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other\nchap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today\nspitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook.\nCause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't think.\nCome in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they\nchange the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like\nmushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what\nsomeone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I\nwent the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did.\nShe too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something\nawfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been\nthinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came\nto the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The\npropitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by\ntheir eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till\ntheir dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the\nMoorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts\nwere developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when\nwe drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord\nmayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.\nThere she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up\nlike a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be,\nwaiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in\nmother's clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.\nAnd the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she\ncould whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass\nwhore in Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind,\nplease, telling me the right time? I'll tell you the right time up a\ndark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for\nfat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game.\nOf course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.\nDidn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that\nsatisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.\nFine eyes she had, clear. It's the white of the eye brings that out not\nso much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting\nbeyond a dog's jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high\nschool drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call\nthat innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.\nNever see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_. Eyes all over them.\nLook under the bed for what's not there. Longing to get the fright of\ntheir lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at\nthe corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,\ntwigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that?\nTypist going up Roger Greene's stairs two at a time to show her\nunderstandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.\nBred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the\nmirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman's eye\non a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly's Paisley shawl to\nPrescott's by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her\nstocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries\nparcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand,\nshaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you\nlearn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don't they\nknow! Three years old she was in front of Molly's dressingtable, just\nbefore we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who\nknows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway\nnot like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are.\nSwell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.\nNot like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in\nGrafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.\nA monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads\nand zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see\nand Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the\nrocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion.\nDarling, I saw, your. I saw all.\nLord!\nDid me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For\nthis relief much thanks. In _Hamlet,_ that is. Lord! It was all things\ncombined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of\nmy tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He's right. Might have made a\nworse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I\nwill tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It\ncouldn't be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however\nlike my name and the address Dolphin's barn a blind.\nHer maiden name was Jemina Brown\nAnd she lived with her mother in Irishtown.\nPlace made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.\nWiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if\nit understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw\nanything straight at school. Crooked as a ram's horn. Sad however\nbecause it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping\nand papa's pants will soon fit Willy and fuller's earth for the baby\nwhen they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them\nout of harm's way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.\nChildren's hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even\nclosed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.\nOughtn't to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up\nwith wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is\nnurse Callan there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly\nwas in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her\nbrushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too,\nmarriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City\nArms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.\nHave that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in\nthe morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the\nhusband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like\nglue. Maybe the women's fault also. That's where Molly can knock spots\noff them. It's the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the\nfigure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those\nothers. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to\nintroduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript,\nwouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his\nwife. Still there's destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own\nsecrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman\ndidn't take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a\nshilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched\nthem. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one.\nOr old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent\nin December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is\nnot back. Better detach.\nOw!\nOther hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the\nshort of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch.\nWristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic\ninfluence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I\nsuppose, at once. Cat's away, the mice will play. I remember looking in\nPill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism.\nEarth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement.\nAnd time, well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing\nstopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it's all\narranged. Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the\nstars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come.\nCome. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up\nand look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if\nyou're a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look\nand if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.\nWonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third\nperson. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw\nstuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at\nthe horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine\nvoice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like\nflowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the\npaint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her\nslipper on the floor so they wouldn't hear. But lots of them can't kick\nthe beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all\nround over me and half down my back.\nWait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave\nyou this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it?\nHeliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that\nkind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,\nwith a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the\ndance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She\nwas wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good\nconductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection.\nFor instance if you go into a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing\ntoo. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,\nslow but sure. Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains blown\nacross. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this\nmorning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It's like a fine\nfine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you\ncall it gossamer, and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as\nanything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything\nshe takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little\nkick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff\nin her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too.\nReminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There\nor the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes\nand corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.\nMuskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years.\nDogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm.\nHm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that\nway. We're the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have\ntheir period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.\nLike what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the\ngrass.\nPerhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long\nJohn had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink\ngives that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because\npriests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like\nflies round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The\ntree of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to.\nThat diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life.\nAnd it's extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.\nMr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.\nAlmonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that's the soap.\nO by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never\nwent back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag\nthis morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could\nmention Meagher's just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph.\nTwo and nine. Bad opinion of me he'll have. Call tomorrow. How much do\nI owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving\ncredit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run\nup a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into\nsomewhere else.\nHere's this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as\nfar as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had\na good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper\nwalk a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government\nsit. Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.\nStill you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as\nwomen don't mock what matter? That's the way to find out. Ask yourself\nwho is he now. _The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr\nLeopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that\nfellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his\nkismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain\nthey say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body\nfeels the atmosphere. Old Betty's joints are on the rack. Mother\nShipton's prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the\ntwinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills\nseem coming nigh.\nHowth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or\nthey might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of\nthe dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds\nflash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt\nyou. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through\nthe small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against.\nScowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in\nthe shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest.\nRoygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,\nviolet. A star I see. Venus? Can't tell yet. Two. When three it's\nnight. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom\nship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of\nthe setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native\nland, goodnight.\nDew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white\nfluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his\nway up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold,\nsore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the\nposition. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don't\nknow how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green\napples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it's the only time we cross\nlegs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy\nchairs under them. But it's the evening influence. They feel all that.\nOpen like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes,\nin ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat\nDillon's garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length\noilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns.\nHistory repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I'm with you once again.\nLife, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her\nlame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.\nThey take advantage.\nAll quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The\nrhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the\nplumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change:\nthat's all. Lovers: yum yum.\nTired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of\nme, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it\ncomes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the\nsame. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing\nnew under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin's Barn. Are you not happy in\nyour? Naughty darling. At Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's\nhouse. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy,\nLouy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the\nold major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I\nan only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into\nyourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he\nand she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip:\ntear in Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle:\ncockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She\nleaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in\nSleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty\nfrom the dew.\nBa. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a\ntree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you\ncould be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he\ngoes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very\nlikely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him\nout, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray\nfor us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition.\nSame thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there's the\nlight in the priest's house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the\nmistake in the valuation when I was in Thom's. Twentyeight it is. Two\nhouses they have. Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder\nwhy they come out at night like mice. They're a mixed breed. Birds are\nlike hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit\nstill. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of\na jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with\ntiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey\nwhite. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example\nlike the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants\nto stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning\non the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with\nthree colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the\n_City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different\ncolours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That's how that\nwise man what's his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes\non fire. It can't be tourists' matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry\nrub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act\nas a burning glass in the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory's not\nso bad.\nBa. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last\nweek got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be\nthe one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what\nthey say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they\nhave to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms,\ntelegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of\noceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like\nseacows. _Faugh a ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in\nvessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake\nwhen the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at\nthe ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it's round.\nWife in every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till\nJohnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail\nend of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor's\nweighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well.\nAnd the tephilim no what's this they call it poor papa's father had on\nhis door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into\nthe house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when\nyou go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of\na beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and\nthat's the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish\never get seasick?\nThen you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,\ncrew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker, moon looking down so\npeaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.\nA last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of\nfunds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of\nviolet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The\nshepherd's hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to\nhouse, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o'clock\npostman, the glowworm's lamp at his belt gleaming here and there\nthrough the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted\nlintstock lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens of lighted\nwindows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening\nTelegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!_ and from\nthe door of Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat\nflew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept,\ngrey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum\nrhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift,\nruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep\nand slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the\nanchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.\nLife those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish\nLights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and\nbreeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in\nthe Erin's King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the\nzoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking\noverboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in\ntheir faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing.\nDon't know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean.\nBut being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I\ndidn't want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with\nmasks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I'll murder you.\nIs it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can\npeople aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only\ntroubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that.\nAfter getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What\ndo they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with\nthe umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking.\nLittle hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when\nyou touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I\nremember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is\nmore sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves\nout if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening\nme. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child!\nStrange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar.\nLooking from Buena Vista. O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old\nBarbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men\nto cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like\nthis, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich\ngentleman coming with a private yacht. _Buenas noches, se\u00f1orita. El\nhombre ama la muchacha hermosa_. Why me? Because you were so foreign\nfrom the others.\nBetter not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you\ndull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for\n_Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital\nto see. Hope she's over. Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral,\nhouse of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that\nbawler in Barney Kiernan's. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what\nI said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought\nto go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in\ncompany. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me.\nLook at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he\nmeant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he\nhawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty.\nParticularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of\nthe wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early\nmorning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he\nkissed the cow. But Dignam's put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so\ndepressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must\ncall to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for\ngranted we're going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it\noutside Cramer's that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but\nprogressing favourably on the premium. Her widow's mite. Well? What do\nyou expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to\nsee. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O'Connor wife and five children\npoisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly\nwoman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and\na large apron. Ladies' grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a\npair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.\nUgly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we\ndie. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the\ntrick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed.\nCurse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She\nhad red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does?\nWould I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti's gone.\nMailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes's. Work\nHynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in\nthem. What's that? Might be money.\nMr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He\nbrought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go.\nBetter. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and\npebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with\nstory of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children\nalways want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the\nwaters. What's this? Bit of stick.\nO! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here\ntomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers\ndo. Will I?\nMr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write\na message for her. Might remain. What?\nI.\nSome flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide\ncomes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark\nmirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and\nletters. O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the\nmeaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not\nlike.\nAM. A.\nNo room. Let it go.\nMr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.\nNothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here.\nExcept Guinness's barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by\ndesign.\nHe flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now\nif you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn't. Chance.\nWe'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made\nme feel so young.\nShort snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.\nNot even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I\nwon't go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a\nmoment. Won't sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat\nagain. No harm in him. Just a few.\nO sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me\ndo love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed\nmet him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair\nheave under embon _se\u00f1orita_ young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan\nWinkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail\nend Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return\nnext in her next her next.\nA bat flew.

Just\nfor a few\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo.\nThe clock on the mantelpiece in the priest's house cooed where Canon\nO'Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.

Also he took the cup that stood\ntofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to\ndrink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far\nas he might to their both's health for he was a passing good man of his\nlustiness.

But on young Malachi they waited for that\nhe promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how\nhe had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast\nfriendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that\nhis languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as\nthey feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red\nhim, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.\nFor they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each\ngen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining\nthat put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen\nout a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house\nthat now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next\nbefore her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her\ncase). And they said farther she should live because in the beginning,\nthey said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that\nwere of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for\nhe had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young\nLynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it\nwas never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the\nlaw nor his judges did provide no remedy.

Then young Madden showed all the\nwhole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion\nsake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint\nUltan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby\nthey were all wondrous grieved.

I question with you there, says he.\nMore like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little\nmoved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had\ndispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the\nhospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted\ncowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the\nbull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He'll\nfind himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that's\nIrish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and\nhe sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I\nconceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our\nisland by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with\nan emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the\ntable, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a\nportlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a\ncoat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his\nnostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and\nrollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.\nWhat for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas\nthat was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who\nwere no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my\ncousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing,\nand with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and\nthe blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he\ntaught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess\nand widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the\nmonth whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the\nnape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young\nravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his\nword: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat\nwith a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his\nforelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables\nfor him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of\nthe best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his\nheart's content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they\ncalled him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.

And Molly won seven shillings on a three\nyear old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old\nfiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and\nyou had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur\nthat Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to\nnineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and\nI'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\nMRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\nBLOOM: Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other\nducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I\nadmired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though\nit was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a\nthing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\nMRS BREEN: _(Squeezes his arm, simpers.)_ Naughty cruel I was!\nBLOOM: _(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.)_ And Molly was eating a\nsandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket.\nFrankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much\nfor her style. She was...\nMRS BREEN: Too...\nBLOOM: Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly\nwere mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius\nMoses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter,\nDancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you\nasked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...\nMRS BREEN: _(Eagerly.)_ Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n_(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on\ntowards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her\nfeet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers\nlisten to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with\nraucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in\nmaimed sodden playfight.)_\nTHE GAFFER: _(Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.)_ And when\nCairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he\nafter doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there\nwaiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\nTHE LOITERERS: _(Guffaw with cleft palates.)_ O jays!\n_(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their\nlodges they frisk limblessly about him.)_\nBLOOM: Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad\ndaylight. Trying to walk.

The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those\npolicemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in\nthe service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or\ntwo in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole\nthrough a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet\nparts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law\nwere well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to\nprotect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping\nsoldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off\nat any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians\nshould by any chance they fall out over anything. You frittered away\nyour time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character\nbesides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the\n_demimonde_ ran away with a lot of \u00a3. s. d. into the bargain and the\ngreatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the\nmuch vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old\nwine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing\naperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch\nbeliever in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably\ndrew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of\nyour being at the tender mercy of others practically.

Stephen of his own accord\nstopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren\ncobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just\nmake out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom\nof the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened or had\nbeen mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small\neffort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a\n_quondam_ friend of his father's, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew\nnearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.\n\u2014Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\nA figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches\nsaluted again, calling:\n\u2014Night!\nStephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the\ncompliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch\nas he always believed in minding his own business moved off but\nnevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety\nthough not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he\nknew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next\nto nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising\npeaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some\nsecluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames\nembankment category they might be hanging about there or simply\nmarauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell\nswoop at a moment's notice, your money or your life, leaving you there\nto point a moral, gagged and garrotted.\nStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,\nthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley's\nbreath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him\nand his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of\ninspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a\ncertain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His\ngrandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of\na publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.\nRumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of\nthe lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably\nfine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or\nsome relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had\nenjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This\ntherefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though\ndissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with\nfacetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.\nTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\nNot as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends\nhad all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called\nhim to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of\nother uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of\nStephen to tell him where on God's earth he could get something,\nanything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the\nwashkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they\nwere connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences\nhappening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete\nfabrication from start to finish. Anyhow he was all in.\n\u2014I wouldn't ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows\nI'm on the rocks.\n\u2014There'll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys'\nschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You\nmay mention my name.\n\u2014Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was\nnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck\ntwice in the junior at the christian brothers.\n\u2014I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.",

Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.\nCocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.\nHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then\nhe screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the\nnight with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\n\u2014Pom! he then shouted once.\nThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,\nthere being still a further egg.\n\u2014Pom! he shouted twice.\nEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding\nbloodthirstily:\n_\u2014Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,\nNever missed nor he never will._\nA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like\nasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the\nBisley.\n\u2014Beg pardon, the sailor said.\n\u2014Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\n\u2014Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic\ninfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He\ntoured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that\nin Stockholm.\n\u2014Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.\n\u2014Murphy's my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.\nKnow where that is?\n\u2014Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.\n\u2014That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's\nwhere I hails from.

I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,\nthe Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever\nscuttled a ship. I seen Russia. _Gospodi pomilyou_. That's how the\nRussians prays.\n\u2014You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.\n\u2014Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer\nthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an\nanchor same as I chew that quid.\nHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his\nteeth, bit ferociously:\n\u2014Khaan! Like that.

A friend of mine sent\nme.\nHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed\nto be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.\nThe printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia._\nAll focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage\nwomen in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,\nsleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of\nthem) outside some primitive shanties of osier.\n\u2014Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like\nbreadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more\nchildren.\nSee them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver\nraw.\nHis postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns\nfor several minutes if not more.\n\u2014Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.\nNobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:\n\u2014Glass. That boggles 'em. Glass.\nMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the\ncard to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran\nas follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Se\u00f1or A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,\nChile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.\nThough not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the\neggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the\nLazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which\noccasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat) having\ndetected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he\nrepresented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after\nhaving boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the\nfictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some\nsuspicions of our friend's _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in\na way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some\nWednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say\nthat he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was\nat heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had\nconsistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead\nwhich was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work\na pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up\nwith the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it\ndid come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was\nnot so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering\nthe fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there\nand back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone\nand be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose\nliver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route,\nPlymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive\ntour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern\nBabylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,\nabbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing\njust struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze\naround on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a\nconcert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure\nresorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas,\nEastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the\nChannel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly\nremunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or\nlocal ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M'Coy type lend me your valise\nand I'll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star\nIrish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal\nconsort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes\nand Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of\nsuccess, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some\nfellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and\nthus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.\nAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was\nto be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with\nthe times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was\nmooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments\nwith the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete\nfogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly\nwas for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public\nat large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.\nIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no\nsmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the\nsystem really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry\npounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead\nof being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took\nme for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more\nhumdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the\ngrind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at\nher spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.\nThere were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home\nisland, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora\nof attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around\nDublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there\nwas a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in\nWicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood\nfor elderly wheelmen so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds\nof Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d'\u0153il_ was exceedingly\ngrand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that\nthe influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering\nthe signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic\nassociations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV,\nrhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt\nwith all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when\nyoung men's fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off\nthe cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their\nleft leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the\npillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely\nin its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be\ndesired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of\ncuriosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created\nthe route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the\nother side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.\n\u2014I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had\nlittle pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened\nand every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a\nhouse, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly\nadded, the chinks does.\nPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the\nglobetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.\n\u2014And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his\nback. Knife like that.\nWhilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in\nkeeping with his character and held it in the striking position.\n\u2014In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.\nFellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. _Prepare to\nmeet your God_, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.\nHis heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further\nquestions even should they by any chance want to.\n\u2014That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable\n_stiletto_.\nAfter which harrowing _d\u00e9nouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he\nsnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before\nin his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.",

On more than one occasion, a dozen at\nthe lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a\nsuperannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the\nnot particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at\nit and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone\nsomewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried\nto find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the\nantipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not\nexactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil\nthere was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going\ninto the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that\nthe sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things\nsomebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence\nthough it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that\nsort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery\nand insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for\nthat very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable\ninstitution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland\nor seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like\nthat should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and\ncoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid\nthe elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that\nevery man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the\nwintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to\ncapsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had\nexperienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.\n\u2014There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog,\nhimself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as\ngentleman's valet at six quid a month.

His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round\nthe door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that\nafternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the\nlane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)\nand begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed\nrather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to\nadmit he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles\nstreet and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled\nwith Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they\nreally loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still\njust then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than\nher company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a\nrude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the _Evening\nTelegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side\nof the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was\nnot exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of\ngazers round skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more\nof her.\n\u2014The gunboat, the keeper said.\n\u2014It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,\nhow a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with\ndisease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober\nsenses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of\ncourse I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.\nStill no matter what the cause is from...\nStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely\nremarking:\n\u2014In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a\nroaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to\nbuy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\nThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a\nprude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be\nput a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart\nfrom any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil,\nwere not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a\nthing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a\nstalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a\npolicy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would\nconfer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.\n\u2014You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe\nin the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,\nas distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I\nbelieve in that myself because it has been explained by competent men\nas the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have\nsuch inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\nThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try\nand concentrate and remember before he could say:\n\u2014They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and\ntherefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for\nthe possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I\ncan hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other\npractical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both\nbeing excluded by court etiquette.\nMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the\nmystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he\nfelt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly\nrejoining:",

You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different\nman.\n\u2014Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that\nknife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\nMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated\narticle, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly\nRoman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was\nthe least conspicuous point about it.\n\u2014Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of\nknives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_. Do you think they are\ngenuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and\nlie like old boots. Look at him.\nYet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was\nfull of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it\nwas quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire\nfabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent\nprobability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly\naccurate gospel.\nHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and\nSherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a\nwellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,\nthere was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a\njail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to\nassociate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill\nfraternity. He might even have done for his man supposing it was his\nown case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he\nkilled him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in\ndurance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to\nthe dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our\nnational poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above\ndescribed. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable\nweakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like\nthose jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner\nwho sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner\n_Hesperus_ and etcetera. And when all was said and done the lies a\nfellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to\nthe wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.\n\u2014Mind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed.\nAnalogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants,\nthough that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the\nmidget queen.

There's an example again of simple souls.\nHowever reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who\nreminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the\nboards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the\nmanagement in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host\nof admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him\nthough ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually\nfell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically\nincompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the\nback touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he\nwas none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the\nfish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in\nlittle Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking\nfellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless\nnecessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to\nhave a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or\nher next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\n\u2014Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like\nthat, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own\nhands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they\ncarry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.\nMy wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could\nactually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in\n(technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite\ndark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate\naccounts for character. That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry\nin Italian.\n\u2014The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very\npassionate about ten shillings. _Roberto ruba roba sua_.\n\u2014Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.\n\u2014Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown\nlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles\ntriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san\nTommaso Mastino.\n\u2014It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the\nblood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare\nstreet museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,\nand I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid\nproportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind\nof women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a\nway you find but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides\nthey have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly\nenhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled\nstockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it's a\nthing I simply hate to see.\nInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the\nothers got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,\ncollisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course\nhad his own say to say.

Then someone said something about\nthe case of the s. s. _Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_\nwhich was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with\nall hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the _Mona_'s, said he\nwas afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it\nappears, in her hold.\nAt this stage an incident happened.

Some\nperson or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by\nthe cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a\nbrief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor,\nevidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the\nnoise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the\nground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.
