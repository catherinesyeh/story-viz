But as years went by, there\ncame a time when the gods settled that he should g'back t'Ithaca;\neven then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were\nnot yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun t'pity him\nexcept Neptune, wh'still persecuted him without ceasing and would not\nlet him get home.\nNow Neptune had gone off t'the Ethiopians, wh'are at the world's end,\nand lie in tw'halves, the one looking West and the other East.1 He had\ngone there t'accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying\nhimself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of\nOlympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment\nhe was thinking of Aegisthus, wh'had been killed by Agamemnon's son\nOrestes; s'he said t'the other gods:\n\"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing\nbut their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to\nAgamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew\nit would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury t'warn him not t'do\neither of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure t'take his\nrevenge when he grew up and wanted t'return home. Mercury told him\nthis in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for\neverything in full.\"\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served\nAegisthus right, and s'it would any one else wh'does as he did; but\nAegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart\nbleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,\nfar away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with\nforest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,\ndaughter of the magician Atlas, wh'looks after the bottom of the\nocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth\nasunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,\nand keeps trying by every kind of blandishment t'make him forget his\nhome, s'that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may\nonce more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take n'heed of\nthis, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you\nwith many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being s'angry\nwith him?\"\nAnd Jove said, \"My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget\nUlysses than whom there is n'more capable man on earth, nor more\nliberal in his offerings t'the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear\nin mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having\nblinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to\nNeptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter t'the sea-king Phorcys;\ntherefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by\npreventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together\nand see how we can help him t'return; Neptune will then be pacified,\nfor if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.\"",

You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head\nand eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where\nthe flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never\neither of us seen the other.\"\n\"My mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"tells me I am son t'Ulysses, but it\nis a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son t'one\nwh'had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is\nn'more ill-starred man under heaven than he wh'they tell me is my\nfather.\"\nAnd Minerva said, \"There is n'fear of your race dying out yet, while\nPenelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true,\nwhat is the meaning of all this feasting, and wh'are these people?\nWhat is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in\nthe family\u2014for n'one seems t'be bringing any provisions of his own?\nAnd the guests\u2014how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make\nover the whole house; it is enough t'disgust any respectable person\nwh'comes near them.\"\n\"Sir,\" said Telemachus, \"as regards your question, s'long as my father\nwas here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their\ndispleasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more\nclosely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it\nbetter even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before\nTroy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting\nwere done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\nashes, and I should myself have been heir t'his renown; but now the\nstorm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone\nwithout leaving s'much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing\nbut dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of\nmy father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the\nchiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island\nof Zacynthus, as als'all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are\neating up my house under the pretext of paying their court t'my\nmother, wh'will neither point blank say that she will not marry,7 nor\nyet bring matters t'an end; s'they are making havoc of my estate, and\nbefore long will d's'als'with myself.\"\n\"Is that so?\" exclaimed Minerva, \"then you d'indeed want Ulysses home\nagain. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he\nis the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and\nmaking merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors,\nwere he t'stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming\nfrom Ephyra, where he had been t'beg poison for his arrows from Ilus,\nson of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give\nhim any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him.\nIf Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short\nshrift and a sorry wedding.\n\"But there! It rests with heaven t'determine whether he is t'return,\nand take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you\nt'set about trying t'get rid of these suitors at once. Take my\nadvice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning\u2014lay your\ncase before them, and call heaven t'bear you witness. Bid the suitors\ntake themselves off, each t'his own place, and if your mother's mind\nis set on marrying again, let her g'back t'her father, wh'will find\nher a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that s'dear\na daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you t'take\nthe best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and g'in quest\nof your father wh'has s'long been missing. Some one may tell you\nsomething, or (and people often hear things in this way) some\nheaven-sent message may direct you. First g't'Pylos and ask Nestor;\nthence g'on t'Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all\nthe Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way\nhome, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet\nanother twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come\nhome at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a\nbarrow t'his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having\ndone all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or\nfoul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are to'old to\nplead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing\nOrestes' praises for having killed his father's murderer Aegisthus? You\nare a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make\nyourself a name in story. Now, however, I must g'back t'my ship and\nt'my crew, wh'will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think\nthe matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said t'you.\"",

He bound his sandals on t'his comely feet,\ngirded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an\nimmortal god. He at once sent the criers round t'call the people in\nassembly, s'they called them and the people gathered thereon; then,\nwhen they were got together, he went t'the place of assembly spear in\nhand\u2014not alone, for his tw'hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him\nwith a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as\nhe went by, and when he took his place in his father's seat even the\noldest councillors made way for him.\nAegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, was\nthe first t'speak. His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses t'Ilius,\nland of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they\nwere all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him.17\nHe had three sons left, of whom tw'still worked on their father's\nland, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless\ntheir father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still\nweeping for him when he began his speech.\n\"Men of Ithaca,\" he said, \"hear my words. From the day Ulysses left us\nthere has been n'meeting of our councillors until now; wh'then can it\nbe, whether old or young, that finds it s'necessary t'convene us? Has\nhe got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish t'warn us, or\nwould he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure he is\nan excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart's\ndesire.\"\nTelemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he\nwas bursting with what he had t'say. He stood in the middle of the\nassembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,\nturning t'Aegyptius, \"Sir,\" said he, \"it is I, as you will shortly\nlearn, wh'have convened you, for it is I wh'am the most aggrieved. I\nhave not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you,\nnor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My\ngrievance is purely personal, and turns on tw'great misfortunes which\nhave fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my\nexcellent father, wh'was chief among all you here present, and was\nlike a father t'every one of you; the second is much more serious, and\nere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief\nmen among you are pestering my mother t'marry them against her will.\nThey are afraid t'g't'her father Icarius, asking him t'choose the\none he likes best, and t'provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but\nday by day they keep hanging about my father's house, sacrificing our\noxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving s'much\nas a thought t'the quantity of wine they drink. N'estate can stand\nsuch recklessness; we have now n'Ulysses t'ward off harm from our\ndoors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days\nbe as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had\npower t'd'so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house\nis being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, t'your own\nconsciences and t'public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest\nthe gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and\nThemis, wh'is the beginning and the end of councils, [d'not] hold\nback, my friends, and leave me singlehanded18\u2014unless it be that my\nbrave father Ulysses did some wrong t'the Achaeans which you would now\navenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am\nt'be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the\neating yourselves, for I could then take action against you t'some\npurpose, and serve you with notices from house t'house till I got paid\nin full, whereas now I have n'remedy.\"19\nWith this Telemachus dashed his staff t'the ground and burst into\ntears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no\none ventured t'make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, wh'spoke\nthus:\n\"Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try t'throw\nthe blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours, for she\nis a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she\nhad been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us,\nand sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And\nthen there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great\ntambour frame in her room, and began t'work on an enormous piece of\nfine needlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead,\nstill d'not press me t'marry again immediately, wait\u2014for I would not\nhave skill in needlework perish unrecorded\u2014till I have completed a pall\nfor the her'Laertes, t'be in readiness against the time when death\nshall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk\nif he is laid out without a pall.'\n\"This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her\nworking on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick\nthe stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three\nyears and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was now\nin her fourth year, one of her maids wh'knew what she was doing told\nus, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, s'she had to\nfinish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you\nthis answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand\u2014'Send your\nmother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father's\nchoice'; for I d'not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us\nmuch longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the\naccomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is s'clever.\nWe never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena,\nMycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing t'your\nmother any one of them. It was not fair of her t'treat us in that way,\nand as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven has now\nendowed her, s'long shall we g'on eating up your estate; and I d'not\nsee why she should change, for she gets all the honour and glory, and\nit is you wh'pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that we will not\ng'back t'our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made her\nchoice and married some one or other of us.\"\nTelemachus answered, \"Antinous, how can I drive the mother wh'bore me\nfrom my father's house? My father is abroad and we d'not know whether\nhe is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have t'pay Icarius the\nlarge sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter\nback t'him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will\nals'punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will call on\nthe Erinyes t'avenge her; besides, it would not be a creditable thing\nt'do, and I will have nothing t'say t'it. If you choose t'take\noffence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another's\nhouses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand, you\nelect t'persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove\nshall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father's house\nthere shall be n'man t'avenge you.\"\nAs he spoke Jove sent tw'eagles from the top of the mountain, and they\nflew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly\nflight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they\nwheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring\ndeath int'the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting fiercely\nand tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the\ntown. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what\nall this might be; whereon Halitherses, wh'was the best prophet and\nreader of omens among them, spoke t'them plainly and in all honesty,\nsaying:\n\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly t'the suitors,\nfor I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going t'be away\nmuch longer; indeed he is close at hand t'deal out death and\ndestruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us wh'live in\nIthaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop t'this wickedness\nbefore he comes. Let the suitors d's'of their own accord; it will be\nbetter for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge;\neverything has happened t'Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set\nout for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through much\nhardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the\ntwentieth year and that n'one would know him; and now all this is\ncoming true.\"\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, \"G'home, old man, and prophesy to\nyour own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens\nmyself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the\nsunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has\ndied in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with\nhim, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel t'the anger\nof Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he\nwill give you something for your family, but I tell you\u2014and it shall\nsurely be\u2014when an old man like you, wh'should know better, talks a\nyoung one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his\nyoung friend will only fare s'much the worse\u2014he will take nothing by\nit, for the suitors will prevent this\u2014and in the next, we will lay a\nheavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for\nit will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the\npresence of you all t'send his mother back t'her father, wh'will\nfind her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts s'dear\na daughter may expect. Till then we shall g'on harassing him with our\nsuit; for we fear n'man, and care neither for him, with all his fine\nspeeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much\nas you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall g'back\nand continue t'eat up Telemachus's estate without paying him, till\nsuch time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day\nafter day on the tiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in\nhis suit for a prize of such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go\nafter the other women whom we should marry in due course, but for the\nway in which she treats us.\"\nThen Telemachus said, \"Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say\nn'more, and entreat you n'further, for the gods and the people of\nIthaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty\nmen t'take me hither and thither, and I will g't'Sparta and t'Pylos\nin quest of my father wh'has s'long been missing. Some one may tell\nme something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some\nheaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on\nhis way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet\nanother twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will\nreturn at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a\nbarrow t'his memory, and make my mother marry again.\"\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor20 wh'had been a friend of\nUlysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority\nover the servants, rose t'speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty\naddressed them thus:\n\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one wh'will govern you equitably; I\nhope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for\nthere is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, wh'ruled you as\nthough he were your father. I am not half s'angry with the suitors,\nfor if they choose t'd'violence in the naughtiness of their hearts,\nand wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the\nhigh hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at\nthe way in which you all sit still without even trying t'stop such\nscandalous goings on\u2014which you could d'if you chose, for you are many\nand they are few.\"\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, \"Mentor, what folly is\nall this, that you should set the people t'stay us? It is a hard thing\nfor one man t'fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses\nhimself were t'set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do\nhis best t'oust us, his wife, wh'wants him back s'very badly, would\nhave small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own\nhead if he fought against such great odds. There is n'sense in what\nyou have been saying. Now, therefore, d'you people g'about your\nbusiness, and let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses,\nspeed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all\u2014which I d'not think\nhe will, for he is more likely t'stay where he is till some one comes\nand tells him something.\"\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back t'his own\nabode, while the suitors returned t'the house of Ulysses.",

            "text": "Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the\ngrey waves, and prayed t'Minerva.\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"you god wh'visited me yesterday, and bade me\nsail the seas in search of my father wh'has s'long been missing. I\nwould obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked\nsuitors, are hindering me that I cannot d'so.\"\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up t'him in the likeness and\nwith the voice of Mentor. \"Telemachus,\" said she, \"if you are made of\nthe same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward\nhenceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half\ndone. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,\nbut unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins\nI see n'likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as\ntheir fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as you are\nnot going t'be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not\nentirely without some share of your father's wise discernment, I look\nwith hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause\nwith any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor\nvirtue, and give n'thought t'death and t'the doom that will shortly\nfall on one and all of them, s'that they shall perish on the same day.\nAs for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was such\nan old friend of mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with\nyou myself. Now, however, return home, and g'about among the suitors;\nbegin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well\nstowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of\nlife, in leathern bags, while I g'round the town and beat up\nvolunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I\nwill run my eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get\nher ready and will put out t'sea without delay.\"\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost n'time in\ndoing as the goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the\nsuitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous\ncame up t'him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,\nsaying, \"Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear n'more ill blood neither\nin word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used t'do. The\nAchaeans will find you in everything\u2014a ship and a picked crew to\nboot\u2014s'that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your\nnoble father.\"\n\"Antinous,\" answered Telemachus, \"I cannot eat in peace, nor take\npleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that\nyou should waste s'much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?\nNow that I am older and know more about it, I am als'stronger, and\nwhether here among this people, or by going t'Pylos, I will d'you all\nthe harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain\u2014though,\nthanks t'you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must\nbe passenger not captain.\"\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the\nothers went on getting dinner ready about the buildings,21 jeering at\nhim tauntingly as they did so.\n\"Telemachus,\" said one youngster, \"means t'be the death of us; I\nsuppose he thinks he can bring friends t'help him from Pylos, or again\nfrom Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he g't'Ephyra as\nwell, for poison t'put in our wine and kill us?\"\nAnother said, \"Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be\nlike his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should\nhave plenty t'do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us:\nas for the house we can let his mother and the man wh'marries her have\nthat.\"\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down int'the lofty and\nspacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze lay\nheaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were\nkept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive\noil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god\nt'drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home\nagain after all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in\nthe middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea, daughter\nof Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and\nday. Telemachus called her t'the store-room and said:\n\"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are\nkeeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should\nescape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve\njars, and see that they all have lids; als'fill me some well-sewn\nleathern bags with barley meal\u2014about twenty measures in all. Get these\nthings put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take\neverything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for\nthe night. I am going t'Sparta and t'Pylos t'see if I can hear\nanything about the return of my dear father.\"\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began t'cry, and spoke fondly t'him,\nsaying, \"My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into\nyour head? Where in the world d'you want t'g'to\u2014you, wh'are the one\nhope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign\ncountry nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these\nwicked ones here will be scheming t'get you put out of the way, and\nwill share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are\namong your own people, and d'not g'wandering and worrying your life\nout on the barren ocean.\"\n\"Fear not, nurse,\" answered Telemachus, \"my scheme is not without\nheaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this\nt'my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she\nhears of my having gone, and asks you; for I d'not want her t'spoil\nher beauty by crying.\"\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had\ncompleted her oath, she began drawing off the wine int'jars, and\ngetting the barley meal int'the bags, while Telemachus went back to\nthe suitors.\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and\nwent round the town t'each one of the crew, telling them t'meet at\nthe ship by sundown. She went als't'Noemon son of Phronius, and asked\nhim t'let her have a ship\u2014which he was very ready t'do. When the sun\nhad set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship int'the\nwater, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and\nstationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the crew came up,\nand the goddess spoke encouragingly t'each of them.\nFurthermore she went t'the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors\nint'a deep slumber. She caused their drink t'fuddle them, and made\nthem drop their cups from their hands, s'that instead of sitting over\ntheir wine, they went back int'the town t'sleep, with their eyes\nheavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of\nMentor, and called Telemachus t'come outside.\n\"Telemachus,\" said she, \"the men are on board and at their oars,\nwaiting for you t'give your orders, s'make haste and let us be off.\"\nOn this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When\nthey got t'the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side, and\nTelemachus said, \"Now my men, help me t'get the stores on board; they\nare all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not know\nanything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.\"\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after. When\nthey had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,\nMinerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the\nvessel, while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the\nhawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair\nwind from the West,22 that whistled over the deep blue waves23 whereon\nTelemachus told them t'catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and\nthey did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross\nplank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they\nhoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the\nsail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue\nwater, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then\nthey made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing bowls t'the\nbrim, and made drink offerings t'the immortal gods that are from\neverlasting, but more particularly t'the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.\nThus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night",

Our best men all of them fell there\u2014Ajax, Achilles,\nPatroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a\nman singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much\nmore than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story?\nThough you were t'stay here and question me for five years, or even\nsix, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would\nturn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we\ntry every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us;\nduring all this time there was n'one wh'could compare with your\nfather in subtlety\u2014if indeed you are his son\u2014I can hardly believe my\neyes\u2014and you talk just like him too\u2014n'one would say that people of\nsuch different ages could speak s'much alike. He and I never had any\nkind of difference from first t'last neither in camp nor council, but\nin singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might\nbe ordered for the best.\n\"When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail\nin our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit t'vex the\nArgives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either wise\nor understanding, and hence many came t'a bad end through the\ndispleasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, wh'brought about a quarrel\nbetween the tw'sons of Atreus.\n\"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for\nit was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they\nexplained why they had called the people together, it seemed that\nMenelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased\nAgamemnon, wh'thought that we should wait till we had offered\nhecatombs t'appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might\nhave known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have\nmade up their minds they d'not change them lightly. S'the tw'stood\nbandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang t'their feet with a\ncry that rent the air, and were of tw'minds as t'what they should do.\n\"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching\nmischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into\nthe water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,\nabout half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We\u2014the other\nhalf\u2014embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had\nsmoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices t'the\ngods, for we were longing t'get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet\nmean that we should d'so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of\nwhich some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away\nunder Ulysses t'make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the\nships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was\nbrewing. The son of Tydeus went on als'with me, and his crews with\nhim. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our\nminds about our course\u2014for we did not know whether t'g'outside Chios\nby the island of Psyra, keeping this t'our left, or inside Chios, over\nagainst the stormy headland of Mimas. S'we asked heaven for a sign,\nand were shown one t'the effect that we should be soonest out of\ndanger if we headed our ships across the open sea t'Euboea. This we\ntherefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage\nduring the night t'Geraestus,29 where we offered many sacrifices to\nNeptune for having helped us s'far on our way. Four days later Diomed\nand his men stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos,\nand the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it\nfair for me.\n\"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything\nabout the others. I know neither wh'got home safely nor wh'were lost",

Would that heaven might grant\nme t'd'like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, wh'are\nill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have n'such\nhappiness in store for me and for my father, s'we must bear it as best\nwe may.\"\n\"My friend,\" said Nestor, \"now that you remind me, I remember t'have\nheard that your mother has many suitors, wh'are ill disposed towards\nyou and are making havoc of your estate. D'you submit t'this tamely,\nor are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Wh'knows\nbut what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in\nfull, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If\nMinerva were t'take as great a liking t'you as she did t'Ulysses\nwhen we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so\nopenly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she\nwould take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would\nsoon some of them forget their wooing.\"\nTelemachus answered, \"I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far\nto'much t'hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though\nthe gods themselves willed it n'such good fortune could befall me.\"\nOn this Minerva said, \"Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven\nhas a long arm if it is minded t'save a man; and if it were me, I\nshould not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I\ncould be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get home\nquickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the\ntreachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when\na man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, n'matter how\nfond they are of him.\"\n\"Mentor,\" answered Telemachus, \"d'not let us talk about it any more.\nThere is n'chance of my father's ever coming back; the gods have long\nsince counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,\nabout which I should like t'ask Nestor, for he knows much more than\nany one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so\nthat it is like talking t'an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and\ntell me true; how did Agamemnon come t'die in that way? What was\nMenelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus t'kill s'far better a\nman than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging\nelsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed\nAgamemnon?\"\n\"I will tell you truly,\" answered Nestor, \"and indeed you have yourself\ndivined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had\nfound Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no\nbarrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have\nbeen thrown outside the city t'dogs and vultures, and not a woman\nwould have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but\nwe were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus, wh'was\ntaking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon's wife\nClytemnestra with incessant flattery.\n\"At first she would have nothing t'd'with his wicked scheme, for she\nwas of a good natural disposition;30 moreover there was a bard with\nher, t'whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy,\nthat he was t'keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled\nher destruction, Aegisthus carried this bard off t'a desert island and\nleft him there for crows and seagulls t'batten upon\u2014after which she\nwent willingly enough t'the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many\nburnt sacrifices t'the gods, and decorated many temples with\ntapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his\nexpectations.\n\"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms\nwith one another. When we got t'Sunium, which is the point of Athens,\nApoll'with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of\nMenelaus' ship (and never man knew better how t'handle a vessel in\nrough weather) s'that he died then and there with the helm in his\nhand, and Menelaus, though very anxious t'press forward, had t'wait\nin order t'bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites.\nPresently, when he to'could put t'sea again, and had sailed on as far\nas the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow\nhard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and\ntook the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about\nthe waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts\nstretching out int'the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along\nthis part of the coast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there\nis a south wind blowing, but after Phaestus the coast is more\nprotected, for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this\npart of the fleet was driven on t'the rocks and wrecked; but the crews\njust managed t'save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were\ntaken by winds and seas t'Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and\nsubstance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at\nhome plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed\nAgamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and the people were obedient under him,\nbut in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens t'be his bane,\nand killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral\nrites of his mother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet t'the people\nof Argos, and on that very day Menelaus came home,31 with as much\ntreasure as his ships could carry.\n\"Take my advice then, and d'not g'travelling about for long s'far\nfrom home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your\nhouse; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will\nhave been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by all means\nt'g'and visit Menelaus, wh'has lately come off a voyage among such\ndistant peoples as n'man could ever hope t'get back from, when the\nwinds had once carried him s'far out of his reckoning; even birds\ncannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, s'vast and terrible are the\nseas that they must cross. G't'him, therefore, by sea, and take your\nown men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a\nchariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons wh'can escort you\nt'Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives.

In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a\nbroad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by\nman under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up t'you\nin sacrifice.\"\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to\nhis own house, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got\nthere and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed\nthem a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the\nhousekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the\nwine, he prayed much and made drink offerings t'Minerva, daughter of\nAegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink offerings and\nhad drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home t'bed\neach in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus t'sleep in the room\nthat was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, wh'was the only\nunmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room\nof the house, with the queen his wife by his side.\nNow when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left\nhis couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble\nthat stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of\ngods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone t'the house of\nHades; s'Nestor sat in his seat sceptre in hand, as guardian of the\npublic weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him,\nEchephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son\nwas Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with\nthem. Nestor then addressed them.\n\"My sons,\" said he, \"make haste t'd'as I shall bid you. I wish first\nand foremost t'propitiate the great goddess Minerva, wh'manifested\nherself visibly t'me during yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one or\nother of you t'the plain, tell the stockman t'look me out a heifer,\nand come on here with it at once. Another must g't'Telemachus' ship,\nand invite all the crew, leaving tw'men only in charge of the vessel.\nSome one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith t'gild the\nhorns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the\nmaids in the house t'prepare an excellent dinner, and t'fetch seats,\nand logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them als't'bring me some\nclear spring water.\"\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was\nbrought in from the plain, and Telemachus's crew came from the ship;\nthe goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he\nworked his gold, and Minerva herself came t'accept the sacrifice.\nNestor gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer\nthat the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and\nEchephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the\nhouse in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand\nhe held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a\nsharp axe, ready t'strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket.\nThen Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley\nmeal, and he offered many a prayer t'Minerva as he threw a lock from\nthe heifer's head upon the fire.\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal32 Thrasymedes\ndealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut\nthrough the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and\ndaughters in law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was\neldest daughter t'Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they lifted\nthe heifer's head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut her throat.\nWhen she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They\ncut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two\nlayers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then\nNestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while\nthe young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands.\nWhen the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they\ncut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the spits and\ntoasted them over the fire.\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed\nTelemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she\nbrought him a fair mantle and shirt,33 and he looked like a god as he\ncame from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor.

            "text": "THE VISIT T'KING MENELAUS, WH'TELLS HIS STORY\u2014MEANWHILE THE SUITORS\nIN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.\nthey reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove\nstraight t'the abode of Menelaus36 [and found him in his own house,\nfeasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son,\nand als'of his daughter, whom he was marrying t'the son of that\nvaliant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her to\nhim while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the\nmarriage about; s'he was sending her with chariots and horses t'the\ncity of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles' son was reigning. For his\nonly son he had found a bride from Sparta,37 the daughter of Alector.\nThis son, Megapenthes, was born t'him of a bondwoman, for heaven\nvouchsafed Helen n'more children after she had borne Hermione, wh'was\nfair as golden Venus herself.\nS'the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making\nmerry in his house. There was a bard als't'sing t'them and play his\nlyre, while tw'tumblers went about performing in the midst of them\nwhen the man struck up with his tune.38\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,\nwhereon Eteoneus servant t'Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw\nthem ran hurrying back int'the house t'tell his Master. He went close\nup t'him and said, \"Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two\nmen, wh'look like sons of Jove. What are we t'do? Shall we take their\nhorses out, or tell them t'find friends elsewhere as they best can?\"\nMenelaus was very angry and said, \"Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never\nused t'be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses\nout, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper;\nyou and I have staid often enough at other people's houses before we\ngot back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace\nhenceforward.\"\nS'Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him.\nThey took their sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to\nthe mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they\nleaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the\nway int'the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when\nthey saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then,\nwhen they had admired everything t'their heart's content, they went\nint'the bath room and washed themselves.\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they\nbrought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the tw'took their seats by\nthe side of Menelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful\ngolden ewer, and poured it int'a silver basin for them t'wash their\nhands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought\nthem bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the\nhouse, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and\nset cups of gold by their side.\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, \"Fall to, and welcome; when you have\ndone supper I shall ask wh'you are, for the lineage of such men as you\ncannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of\nsceptre-bearing kings, for poor people d'not have such sons as you\nare.\"\nOn this he handed them39 a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set\nnear him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good\nthings that were before them; as soon as they had had enough t'eat and\ndrink, Telemachus said t'the son of Nestor, with his head s'close\nthat n'one might hear, \"Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see\nthe gleam of bronze and gold\u2014of amber,40 ivory, and silver. Everything\nis s'splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Jove. I am\nlost in admiration.\"\nMenelaus overheard him and said, \"N'one, my sons, can hold his own\nwith Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but\namong mortal men\u2014well, there may be another wh'has as much wealth as I\nhave, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and\nhave undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I\ncould get home with my fleet. I went t'Cyprus, Phoenicia and the\nEgyptians; I went als't'the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the\nErembians, and t'Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are\nborn, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that\ncountry, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good\nmilk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling\nand getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly\nand shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, s'that\nI have n'pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever your\nparents may be they must have told you about all this, and of my heavy\nloss in the ruin41 of a stately mansion fully and magnificently\nfurnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have s'that I\nhad stayed at home, and all those were living wh'perished on the plain\nof Troy, far from Argos. I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for\none and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I\nleave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it.\nYet grieve for these as I may, I d's'for one man more than for them\nall. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep,\ns'miserable does he make me, for n'one of all the Achaeans worked so\nhard or risked s'much as he did. He took nothing by it, and has left a\nlegacy of sorrow t'myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we\nknow not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his\nlong-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left\nbehind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.\"\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he\nbethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him\nthus mentioned, s'that he held his cloak before his face with both\nhands. When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether t'let him choose his\nown time for speaking, or t'ask him at once and find what it was all\nabout.\nWhile he was thus in tw'minds Helen came down from her high vaulted\nand perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought\nher a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phyl'fetched her the\nsilver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus\nlived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world;\nhe gave Menelaus tw'baths, both of pure silver, tw'tripods, and ten\ntalents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful\npresents, t'wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work box that ran on\nwheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phyl'now placed this by\nher side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet\ncoloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat,\nput her feet upon the footstool, and began t'question her husband.42\n\"D'we know, Menelaus,\" said she, \"the names of these strangers who\nhave come t'visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?\u2014but I cannot help\nsaying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman s'like\nsomebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what t'think)\nas this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby\nbehind him, when you Achaeans went t'Troy with battle in your hearts,\non account of my most shameless self.\"\n\"My dear wife,\" replied Menelaus, \"I see the likeness just as you do.\nHis hands and feet are just like Ulysses; s'is his hair, with the\nshape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was\ntalking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my\naccount, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.\"\nThen Pisistratus said, \"Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in\nthinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and\nis ashamed t'come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose\nconversation is s'divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor,\nsent me t'escort him hither, for he wanted t'know whether you could\ngive him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home\nwhen his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this\nis how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is\nn'one among his own people t'stand by him.\"\n\"Bless my heart,\" replied Menelaus, \"then I am receiving a visit from\nthe son of a very dear friend, wh'suffered much hardship for my sake.\nI had always hoped t'entertain him with most marked distinction when\nheaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have\nfounded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should have\nmade him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and\nshould have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that\nare subject t'me. We should thus have seen one another continually,\nand nothing but death could have interrupted s'close and happy an\nintercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great good\nfortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at\nall.\"\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,\nTelemachus wept, and s'did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his\neyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom\nthe son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said t'Menelaus,\n\"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used t'talk about you at home, told me\nyou were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be\npossible, d'as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am\ngetting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon\nI care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all\nwe can d'for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and\nwring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother wh'died at Troy; he\nwas by n'means the worst man there; you are sure t'have known him\u2014his\nname was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say\nthat he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.\"\n\"Your discretion, my friend,\" answered Menelaus, \"is beyond your years.\nIt is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is\nson t'one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and\noffspring\u2014and it has blessed Nestor from first t'last all his days,\ngiving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who\nare both well disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore t'all\nthis weeping, and attend t'our supper again. Let water be poured over\nour hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the\nmorning.\"\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands\nand they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.\nThen Jove's daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged\nthe wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour.\nWhoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest\nof the day, not even though his father and mother both of them drop\ndown dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very\neyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to\nHelen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all\nsorts of herbs, some good t'put int'the mixing bowl and others\npoisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is a skilled\nphysician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put this\ndrug in the bowl, and had told the servants t'serve the wine round,\nshe said:\n\"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable\nmen (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil,\nand can d'what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I\ntell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the\nexploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy,\nand you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself\nwith wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the\nenemy's city looking like a menial or a beggar, and quite different\nfrom what he did when he was among his own people. In this disguise he\nentered the city of Troy, and n'one said anything t'him. I alone\nrecognised him and began t'question him, but he was to'cunning for\nme. When, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him\nclothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not t'betray him t'the\nTrojans till he had got safely back t'his own camp and t'the ships,\nhe told me all that the Achaeans meant t'do. He killed many Trojans\nand got much information before he reached the Argive camp, for all\nwhich things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I\nwas glad, for my heart was beginning t'yearn after my home, and I was\nunhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,\naway from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, wh'is\nindeed by n'means deficient either in person or understanding.\"\nThen Menelaus said, \"All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is\ntrue. I have travelled much, and have had much t'd'with heroes, but I\nhave never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and\nwhat courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the\nbravest of the Argives were lying in wait t'bring death and\ndestruction upon the Trojans.43 At that moment you came up t'us; some\ngod wh'wished well t'the Trojans must have set you on t'it and you\nhad Deiphobus with you. Three times did you g'all round our hiding\nplace and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and\nmimicked all our wives\u2014Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside\nheard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds\nwhether t'spring out then and there, or t'answer you from inside, but\nUlysses held us all in check, s'we sat quite still, all except\nAnticlus, wh'was beginning t'answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two\nbrawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that\nsaved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away\nagain.\"\n\"How sad,\" exclaimed Telemachus, \"that all this was of n'avail t'save\nhim, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased t'send us\nall t'bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.\"\nOn this Helen told the maid servants t'set beds in the room that was\nin the gatehouse, and t'make them with good red rugs, and spread\ncoverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to\nwear. S'the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to\nwhich a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did\nTelemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while the son\nof Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.",

He bound his sandals on t'his comely feet, girded\nhis sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an\nimmortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:\n\"And what, Telemachus, has led you t'take this long sea voyage to\nLacedaemon? Are you on public, or private business? Tell me all about\nit.\"\n\"I have come, sir,\" replied Telemachus, \"t'see if you can tell me\nanything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my\nfair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who\nkeep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of\npaying their addresses t'my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your\nknees if haply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end,\nwhether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other\ntraveller; for he was a man born t'trouble. D'not soften things out\nof any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you\nsaw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by\nword or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it\nin mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.\"\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. \"So,\" he exclaimed,\n\"these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well lay\nher new born young in the lair of a lion, and then g'off t'feed in\nthe forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back t'his\nlair will make short work with the pair of them\u2014and s'will Ulysses\nwith these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is\nstill the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in\nLesbos, and threw him s'heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him\u2014if\nhe is still such and were t'come near these suitors, they would have a\nshort shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I\nwill not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without\nconcealment all that the old man of the sea told me.\n\"I was trying t'come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for\nmy hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are\nvery strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a\nship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an\nisland called Pharos\u2014it has a good harbour from which vessels can get\nout int'open sea when they have taken in water\u2014and here the gods\nbecalmed me twenty days without s'much as a breath of fair wind to\nhelp me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men\nwould have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved\nme in the person of Idothea, daughter t'Proteus, the old man of the\nsea, for she had taken a great fancy t'me.\n\"She came t'me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the\nmen used t'g'with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope\nof catching a fish or tw't'save them from the pangs of hunger.\n'Stranger,' said she, 'it seems t'me that you like starving in this\nway\u2014at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day\nafter day, without even trying t'get away though your men are dying by\ninches.'\n\"'Let me tell you,' said I, 'whichever of the goddesses you may happen\nt'be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have\noffended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods\nknow everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in\nthis way, and tell me als'how I may sail the sea s'as t'reach my\nhome.'\n\"'Stranger,' replied she, 'I will make it all quite clear t'you. There\nis an old immortal wh'lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is\nProteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is\nNeptune's head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom\nof the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you\nabout your voyage, what courses you are t'take, and how you are to\nsail the sea s'as t'reach your home. He will als'tell you, if you so\nwill, all that has been going on at your house both good and bad, while\nyou have been away on your long and dangerous journey.'\n\"'Can you show me,' said I, 'some stratagem by means of which I may\ncatch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a\ngod is not easily caught\u2014not by a mortal man.'\n\"'Stranger,' said she, 'I will make it all quite clear t'you. About\nthe time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the\nsea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs\nthe water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and\ngoes t'sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals\u2014Halosydne's chickens\nas they call them\u2014come up als'from the grey sea, and g't'sleep in\nshoals all round him; and a very strong and fish-like smell d'they\nbring with them. 44 Early to-morrow morning I will take you t'this\nplace and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best\nmen you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the\nold man will play you.\n\"'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he\nhas seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will g't'sleep\namong them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he\nis asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for\nhe will d'his very utmost t'get away from you. He will turn himself\nint'every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become\nals'both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him\ntighter and tighter, till he begins t'talk t'you and comes back to\nwhat he was when you saw him g't'sleep; then you may slacken your\nhold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that\nis angry with you, and what you must d't'reach your home over the\nseas.'\n\"Having s'said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back t'the\nplace where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was\nclouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper\nready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.\n\"When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, I took the\nthree men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went\nalong by the sea-side, praying heartily t'heaven. Meanwhile the\ngoddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all\nof them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father.\nThen she dug four pits for us t'lie in, and sat down t'wait till we\nshould come up. When we were close t'her, she made us lie down in the\npits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our\nambuscade would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy\nseals was most distressing45\u2014wh'would g't'bed with a sea monster if\nhe could help it?\u2014but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of\nsomething that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under\neach man's nostrils, which was s'fragrant that it killed the smell of\nthe seals.46\n\"We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the\nseals come up in hundreds t'bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the\nold man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he\nwent over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted,\nand he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down t'sleep as\nsoon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and\nseized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed\nhimself first int'a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he\nbecame a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running\nwater, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuck t'him and\nnever lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature became\ndistressed, and said, 'Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that\nhatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my\nwill? What d'you want?'\n\"'You know that yourself, old man,' I answered, 'you will gain nothing\nby trying t'put me off. It is because I have been kept s'long in this\nisland, and see n'sign of my being able t'get away. I am losing all\nheart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the\nimmortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me als'how I may sail\nthe sea s'as t'reach my home?'\n\"Then,' he said, 'if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,\nyou must offer sacrifices t'Jove and t'the rest of the gods before\nembarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back t'your\nfriends, and t'your own house, till you have returned t'the\nheaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs t'the immortal\ngods that reign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you\nfinish your voyage.'\n\"I was broken hearted when I heard that I must g'back all that long\nand terrible voyage t'Egypt;47 nevertheless, I answered, 'I will do\nall, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me\ntrue, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we\nset sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them\ncame t'a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends\nwhen the days of his fighting were done.'\n\"'Son of Atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? You had better not know\nwhat I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard\nmy story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many\nstill remain, and only tw'of the chief men among the Achaeans perished\nduring their return home. As for what happened on the field of\nbattle\u2014you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,\nalive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove\nhim on t'the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe\nout of the water, and in spite of all Minerva's hatred he would have\nescaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the\ngods could not drown him even though they had tried t'd'so, and when\nNeptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his tw'brawny\nhands, and split the rock of Gyrae in tw'pieces. The base remained\nwhere it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into\nthe sea and carried Ajax with it; s'he drank salt water and was\ndrowned.\n\"'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Jun'protected him, but when\nhe was just about t'reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught\nby a heavy gale which carried him out t'sea again sorely against his\nwill, and drove him t'the foreland where Thyestes used t'dwell, but\nwhere Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed as\nthough he was t'return safely after all, for the gods backed the wind\nint'its old quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed\nhis native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own\ncountry.\n\"'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and\nt'whom he had promised tw'talents of gold. This man had been looking\nout for a whole year t'make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the\nslip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon g'by, he\nwent and told Aegisthus, wh'at once began t'lay a plot for him. He\npicked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on\none side the cloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a\nbanquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen t'Agamemnon, and\ninvited him t'the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all\nunsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the\nbanquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles;\nnot one of Agamemnon's followers was left alive, nor yet one of\nAegisthus', but they were all killed there in the cloisters.'\n\"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat\ndown upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could n'longer bear\nt'live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had\nmy fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea\nsaid, 'Son of Atreus, d'not waste any more time in crying s'bitterly;\nit can d'n'manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you\ncan, for Aegisthus may be still alive, and even though Orestes has been\nbeforehand with you in killing him, you may yet come in for his\nfuneral.'\n\"On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, 'I know,\nthen, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of whom\nyou spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable t'get home? or is\nhe dead? Tell me, n'matter how much it may grieve me.'\n\"'The third man,' he answered, 'is Ulysses wh'dwells in Ithaca. I can\nsee him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph\nCalypso, wh'is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for\nhe has n'ships nor sailors t'take him over the sea. As for your own\nend, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take you\nt'the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There\nfair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any\nwhere else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail,\nnor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly\nfrom the sea, and gives fresh life t'all men. This will happen t'you\nbecause you have married Helen, and are Jove's son-in-law.'\n\"As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back t'the\nships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went\nalong. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was\nfalling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,\nrosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships int'the water, and put\nour masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took\nour seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I again\nstationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered\nhecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased\nheaven's anger, I raised a barrow t'the memory of Agamemnon that his\nname might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home, for\nthe gods sent me a fair wind.",

I will als'give you a beautiful chalice that\ns'long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a\ndrink-offering t'the immortal gods.\"\n\"Son of Atreus,\" replied Telemachus, \"d'not press me t'stay longer; I\nshould be contented t'remain with you for another twelve months; I\nfind your conversation s'delightful that I should never once wish\nmyself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos\nare already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for any\npresent you may be disposed t'make me, I had rather that it should be\na piece of plate. I will take n'horses back with me t'Ithaca, but\nwill leave them t'adorn your own stables, for you have much flat\nground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as als'meadow-sweet and\nwheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas\nin Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country\nis more fit for goats than horses, and I like it the better for that.\n48 None of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and\nIthaca least of all.\"\nMenelaus smiled and took Telemachus's hand within his own. \"What you\nsay,\" said he, \"shows that you come of good family. I both can, and\nwill, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most\nprecious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl by\nVulcan's own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with\ngold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a\nvisit which I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey.\nI will make you a present of it.\"\nThus did they converse [and guests kept coming t'the king's house.\nThey brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for\nthem t'take with them; s'they were busy cooking their dinners in the\ncourts].49\nMeanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a\nmark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses' house, and were\nbehaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who\nwere their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were\nsitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to\nAntinous,\n\"Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?\nHe has a ship of mine, and I want it, t'cross over t'Elis: I have\ntwelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet\nbroken in, and I want t'bring one of them over here and break him.\"\nThey were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that\nTelemachus had not gone t'the city of Neleus. They thought he was only\naway somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the\nswineherd; s'Antinous said, \"When did he go? Tell me truly, and what\nyoung men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own\nbondsmen\u2014for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him\nhave the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he\ntake it without your leave?\"\n\"I lent it him,\" answered Noemon, \"what else could I d'when a man of\nhis position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me t'oblige him? I\ncould not possibly refuse. As for those wh'went with him they were the\nbest young men we have, and I saw Mentor g'on board as captain\u2014or some\ngod wh'was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor\nhere myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for\nPylos.\"\nNoemon then went back t'his father's house, but Antinous and\nEurymachus were very angry. They told the others t'leave off playing,\nand t'come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,\nAntinous son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with\nrage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:\n\"Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we\nhad made sure that it would come t'nothing, but the young fellow has\ngot away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving\nus trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find\nme a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait\nfor him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the\nday that he set out t'try and get news of his father.\"\nThus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all\nof them went inside the buildings.\nIt was not long ere Penelope came t'know what the suitors were\nplotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the\nouter court as they were laying their schemes within, and went t'tell\nhis mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:\n\"Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it t'tell the\nmaids t'leave their master's business and cook dinner for them? I wish\nthey may neither wo'nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere\nelse, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of\nmy son's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children,\nhow good Ulysses had been t'them\u2014never doing anything high-handed, nor\nspeaking harshly t'anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they\nmay take a fancy t'one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did\nan unjust thing by anybody\u2014which shows what bad hearts you have, and\nthat there is n'such thing as gratitude left in this world.\"\nThen Medon said, \"I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are\nplotting something much more dreadful now\u2014may heaven frustrate their\ndesign. They are going t'try and murder Telemachus as he is coming\nhome from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been t'get news of his\nfather.\"\nThen Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she was\nspeechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no\nutterance. At last, however, she said, \"Why did my son leave me? What\nbusiness had he t'g'sailing off in ships that make long voyages over\nthe ocean like sea-horses? Does he want t'die without leaving any one\nbehind him t'keep up his name?\"\n\"I d'not know,\" answered Medon, \"whether some god set him on t'it, or\nwhether he went on his own impulse t'see if he could find out if his\nfather was dead, or alive and on his way home.\"\nThen he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.\nThere were plenty of seats in the house, but she had n'heart for\nsitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor\nof her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old\nand young, gathered round her and began t'cry too, till at last in a\ntransport of sorrow she exclaimed,\n\"My dears, heaven has been pleased t'try me with more affliction than\nany other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and\nlion-hearted husband, wh'had every good quality under heaven, and\nwhose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my\ndarling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having\nheard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one\nof you would s'much as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though\nyou all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I had known he\nmeant taking this voyage, he would have had t'give it up, n'matter\nhow much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse behind him\u2014one or\nother. Now, however, g'some of you and call old Dolius, wh'was given\nme by my father on my marriage, and wh'is my gardener. Bid him g'at\nonce and tell everything t'Laertes, wh'may be able t'hit on some\nplan for enlisting public sympathy on our side, as against those who\nare trying t'exterminate his own race and that of Ulysses.\"\nThen the dear old nurse Euryclea said, \"You may kill me, Madam, or let\nme live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the\nreal truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in\nthe way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I\nwould not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you\nasked or happened t'hear of his having gone, for he did not want you\nt'spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change\nyour dress, and g'upstairs with your maids t'offer prayers to\nMinerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even\nthough he be in the jaws of death. D'not trouble Laertes: he has\ntrouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the\nrace of the son of Arceisius s'much, but there will be a son left to\ncome up after him, and inherit both the house and the fair fields that\nlie far all round it.\"\nWith these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the\ntears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and\nwent upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley int'a\nbasket and began praying t'Minerva.\n\"Hear me,\" she cried, \"Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable. If\never Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or\nheifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son\nfrom the villainy of the suitors.\"\nShe cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;\nmeanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister,\nand one of them said:\n\"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.\nLittle does she dream that her son has now been doomed t'die.\"\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what was going to\nhappen. Then Antinous said, \"Comrades, let there be n'loud talking,\nlest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and d'that in\nsilence, about which we are all of a mind.\"\nHe then chose twenty men, and they went down t'their ship and t'the\nsea side; they drew the vessel int'the water and got her mast and\nsails inside her; they bound the oars t'the thole-pins with twisted\nthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft,\nwhile their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made the\nship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and\nwaited till night should fall.\nBut Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable t'eat or drink, and\nwondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by the\nwicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen\nhemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into\na slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in the\nlikeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius wh'had\nmarried Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision t'g't'the\nhouse of Ulysses, and t'make Penelope leave off crying, s'it came\nint'her room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the\ndoor to, and hovered over her head saying,\n\"You are asleep, Penelope: the gods wh'live at ease will not suffer\nyou t'weep and be s'sad. Your son has done them n'wrong, s'he will\nyet come back t'you.\"\nPenelope, wh'was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,\n\"Sister, why have you come here? You d'not come very often, but I\nsuppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to\nleave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?\nI, wh'have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, wh'had every good\nquality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and\nmiddle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship\u2014a\nfoolish fellow wh'has never been used t'roughing it, nor t'going\nabout among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than\nabout my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest\nsomething should happen t'him, either from the people among whom he\nhas gone, or by sea, for he has many enemies wh'are plotting against\nhim, and are bent on killing him before he can return home.\"\nThen the vision said, \"Take heart, and be not s'much dismayed. There\nis one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough t'have stand\nby his side, I mean Minerva; it is she wh'has compassion upon you, and\nwh'has sent me t'bear you this message.\"\n\"Then,\" said Penelope, \"if you are a god or have been sent here by\ndivine commission, tell me als'about that other unhappy one\u2014is he\nstill alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?\"\nAnd the vision said, \"I shall not tell you for certain whether he is\nalive or dead, and there is n'use in idle conversation.\"\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated\nint'thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and\ncomforted, s'vivid had been her dream.\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea,\nintent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called\nAsteris, of n'great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and\nthere is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then",

Besides, you are perfectly able to\nprotect Telemachus, and t'see him safely home again, while the suitors\nhave t'come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him.\"\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said t'his son Mercury, \"Mercury, you are\nour messenger, g'therefore and tell Calyps'we have decreed that poor\nUlysses is t'return home. He is t'be convoyed neither by gods nor\nmen, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to\nreach fertile Scheria,50 the land of the Phaeacians, wh'are near of\nkin t'the gods, and will honour him as though he were one of\nourselves. They will send him in a ship t'his own country, and will\ngive him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought\nback from Troy, if he had had all his prize money and had got home\nwithout disaster.

As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden\nshuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there\nwas a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees,\nwherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests\u2014owls, hawks, and\nchattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the waters. A vine\nloaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of\nthe cave; there were als'four running rills of water in channels cut\npretty close together, and turned hither and thither s'as t'irrigate\nthe beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. 51\nEven a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so\nMercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it\nsufficiently he went inside the cave.\nCalyps'knew him at once\u2014for the gods all know each other, n'matter\nhow far they live from one another\u2014but Ulysses was not within; he was\non the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears\nin his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calyps'gave\nMercury a seat and said: \"Why have you come t'see me,\nMercury\u2014honoured, and ever welcome\u2014for you d'not visit me often? Say\nwhat you want; I will d'it for you at once if I can, and if it can be\ndone at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you.\"\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed\nhim some red nectar, s'Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough,\nand then said:\n\"We are speaking god and goddess t'one another, and you ask me why I\nhave come here, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove\nsent me; it was n'doing of mine; wh'could possibly want t'come all\nthis way over the sea where there are n'cities full of people t'offer\nme sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had t'come, for none\nof us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says\nthat you have here the most ill-starred of all those wh'fought nine\nyears before the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year\nafter having sacked it. On their way home they sinned against\nMinerva,52 wh'raised both wind and waves against them, s'that all his\nbrave companions perished, and he alone was carried hither by wind and\ntide. Jove says that you are t'let this man g'at once, for it is\ndecreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but\nshall return t'his house and country and see his friends again.\"\nCalyps'trembled with rage when she heard this, \"You gods,\" she\nexclaimed, \"ought t'be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous\nand hate seeing a goddess take a fancy t'a mortal man, and live with\nhim in open matrimony. S'when rosy-fingered Dawn made love t'Orion,\nyou precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed\nhim in Ortygia. S'again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and\nyielded t'him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove came t'hear of\nit before s'very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts. And now\nyou are angry with me to'because I have a man here. I found the poor\ncreature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his\nship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, s'that all his crew were\ndrowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waves on t'my island.\nI got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him\nimmortal, s'that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot\ncross Jove, nor bring his counsels t'nothing; therefore, if he insists\nupon it, let the man g'beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him\nanywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men wh'can take him.\nNevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good faith, as\nwill be likely t'bring him safely t'his own country.\"",

Calyps'set meat and drink before him of\nthe food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar\nfor herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were\nbefore them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,\nCalyps'spoke, saying:\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, s'you would start home t'your own\nland at once? Good luck g'with you, but if you could only know how\nmuch suffering is in store for you before you get back t'your own\ncountry, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and\nlet me make you immortal, n'matter how anxious you may be t'see this\nwife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet\nI flatter myself that I am n'whit less tall or well-looking than she\nis, for it is not t'be expected that a mortal woman should compare in\nbeauty with an immortal.\"\n\"Goddess,\" replied Ulysses, \"d'not be angry with me about this. I am\nquite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like s'tall or so\nbeautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an\nimmortal. Nevertheless, I want t'get home, and can think of nothing\nelse. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and\nmake the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea\nalready, s'let this g'with the rest.\"\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into\nthe inner part of the cave and went t'bed.\nWhen the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on\nhis shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer\nfabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about\nher waist and a veil t'cover her head. She at once set herself to\nthink how she could speed Ulysses on his way. S'she gave him a great\nbronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and\nhad a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on t'it. She als'gave\nhim a sharp adze, and then led the way t'the far end of the island\nwhere the largest trees grew\u2014alder, poplar and pine, that reached the\nsky\u2014very dry and well seasoned, s'as t'sail light for him in the\nwater.53 Then, when she had shown him where the best trees grew,\nCalyps'went home, leaving him t'cut them, which he soon finished\ndoing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring\nthem by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calyps'came back\nwith some augers, s'he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers\ntogether with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled\nshipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top\nof the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He als'made a mast with a\nyard arm, and a rudder t'steer with. He fenced the raft all round with\nwicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then he threw on\na quantity of wood. By and by Calyps'brought him some linen t'make\nthe sails, and he made these too, excellently, making them fast with\nbraces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers, he drew the\nraft down int'the water.",

He let go\nthe helm, and the force of the hurricane was s'great that it broke the\nmast half way up, and both sail and yard went over int'the sea. For a\nlong time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could d't'rise\nt'the surface again, for the clothes Calyps'had given him weighed him\ndown; but at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter\nbrine that was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this,\nhowever, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he\ncould towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again s'as to\nescape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn\nwinds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though\nthe South, North, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and\nshuttlecock with it at once.\nWhen he was in this plight, In'daughter of Cadmus, als'called\nLeucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been\nsince raised t'the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great\ndistress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like\na sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.\n\"My poor good man,\" said she, \"why is Neptune s'furiously angry with\nyou? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster\nhe will not kill you. You seem t'be a sensible person, d'then as I\nbid you; strip, leave your raft t'drive before the wind, and swim to\nthe Phaeacian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take my\nveil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to\nn'harm s'long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off,\nthrow it back as far as you can int'the sea, and then g'away again.\"\nWith these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived\ndown again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.\nBut Ulysses did not know what t'think. \"Alas,\" he said t'himself in\nhis dismay, \"this is only some one or other of the gods wh'is luring\nme t'ruin by advising me t'quit my raft. At any rate I will not d'so\nat present, for the land where she said I should be quit of all\ntroubles seemed t'be still a good way off. I know what I will do\u2014I am\nsure it will be best\u2014n'matter what happens I will stick t'the raft as\nlong as her timbers hold together, but when the sea breaks her up I\nwill swim for it; I d'not see how I can d'any better than this.\"",

Now the Cyclopes\nwere stronger than they and plundered them, s'their king Nausithous\nmoved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all other\npeople. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples,\nand divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone t'the\nhouse of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were inspired of\nheaven, was now reigning. T'his house, then, did Minerva hie in\nfurtherance of the return of Ulysses.\nShe went straight t'the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there\nslept a girl wh'was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter t'King\nAlcinous. Tw'maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty,\none on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well made\nfolding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's\ndaughter, wh'was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age;\nthen, coming up t'the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she\nhovered over her head and said:\n\"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, t'have such a lazy\ndaughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are\ngoing t'be married almost immediately, and should not only be well\ndressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those wh'attend\nyou. This is the way t'get yourself a good name, and t'make your\nfather and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a\nwashing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you s'that\nyou may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best\nyoung men among your own people are courting you, and you are not going\nt'remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, t'have a\nwaggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, t'take the rugs, robes, and\ngirdles, and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you\nthan walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the town.\"\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away t'Olympus, which they say is\nthe everlasting home of the gods. Here n'wind beats roughly, and\nneither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine\nand in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are\nillumined for ever and ever.

You are the\nchief man here, s'it is only right that you should have a clean shirt\nwhen you attend meetings of the council.

Be off with you, and the men shall\nget you a good strong waggon with a body t'it that will hold all your\nclothes.\"\nOn this he gave his orders t'the servants, wh'got the waggon out,\nharnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the\nclothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her\nmother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good\nthings, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got int'the waggon,\nand her mother gave her als'a golden cruse of oil, that she and her\nwomen might anoint themselves.

You\nwill see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it,\nand paved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in\nship's gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are\nthe places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of\narchers; they know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring\nfolk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which\nthey travel far over the sea.\n\"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against\nme later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low\nfellow, if he met us, might say, 'Wh'is this fine-looking stranger\nthat is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose\nshe is going t'marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has\ntaken from some foreign vessel, for we have n'neighbours; or some god\nhas at last come down from heaven in answer t'her prayers, and she is\ngoing t'live with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good\nthing if she would take herself off and find a husband somewhere else,\nfor she will not look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who\nare in love with her.' This is the kind of disparaging remark that\nwould be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself\nbe scandalised at seeing any other girl d'the like, and g'about with\nmen in spite of everybody, while her father and mother were still\nalive, and without having been married in the face of all the world.\n\"If, therefore, you want my father t'give you an escort and t'help\nyou home, d'as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by\nthe road side dedicated t'Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow\nall round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about\nas far from the town as a man's voice will carry. Sit down there and\nwait for a while till the rest of us can get int'the town and reach my\nfather's house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into\nthe town and ask the way t'the house of my father Alcinous. You will\nhave n'difficulty in finding it; any child will point it out t'you,\nfor n'one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine house\nas he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer\ncourt, g'right across the inner court till you come t'my mother. You\nwill find her sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by\nfirelight. It is a fine sight t'see her as she leans back against one\nof the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind her. Close t'her\nseat stands that of my father, on which he sits and topes like an\nimmortal god. Never mind him, but g'up t'my mother, and lay your\nhands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you can gain her\nover, you may hope t'see your own country again, n'matter how distant\nit may be.\"\nS'saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.\nThe mules drew well, and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.\nShe was careful not t'g'to'fast for Ulysses and the maids wh'were\nfollowing on foot along with the waggon, s'she plied her whip with\njudgement. As the sun was going down they came t'the sacred grove of\nMinerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed t'the mighty daughter\nof Jove.\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, hear\nme now, for you gave n'heed t'my prayers when Neptune was wrecking\nme. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends\nand be hospitably received by the Phaeacians.\"\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show\nherself t'him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, wh'was\nstill furious in his endeavors t'prevent Ulysses from getting home.",

This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,\nand had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over\nthe Phaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god.57\nShe had been nurse t'Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and\nbrought her supper for her int'her own room.\nPresently Ulysses got up t'g'towards the town; and Minerva shed a\nthick mist all round him t'hide him in case any of the proud\nPhaeacians wh'met him should be rude t'him, or ask him wh'he was.\nThen, as he was just entering the town, she came towards him in the\nlikeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front\nof him, and Ulysses said:\n\"My dear, will you be s'kind as t'show me the house of king Alcinous?\nI am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and d'not know one in your\ntown and country.\"\nThen Minerva said, \"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you\nwant, for Alcinous lives quite close t'my own father. I will g'before\nyou and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and d'not look at\nany man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide\nstrangers, and d'not like men wh'come from some other place. They are\na sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships\nthat glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air.\"\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one\nof the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the\nmidst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards\nhim had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their\nharbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,\nwhich, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when\nthey reached the king's house Minerva said:\n\"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.\nYou will find a number of great people sitting at table, but d'not be\nafraid; g'straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is\nt'carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen.\nHer name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband\nAlcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune, wh'was father to\nNausithous by Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the\nyoungest daughter of Eurymedon, wh'at one time reigned over the\ngiants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own life to\nboot.\n\"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the\ngreat Nausithous, wh'reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two\nsons Rhexenor and Alcinous;58 Apoll'killed the first of them while he\nwas still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter\nArete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as n'other woman is honoured\nof all those that keep house along with their husbands.\n\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, wh'look upon\nher as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for\nshe is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any\nwomen are friends of hers, she will help their husbands als't'settle\ntheir disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope\nof seeing your friends again, and getting safely back t'your home and\ncountry.\"\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea.

The walls on either side were of bronze from end t'end, and the\ncornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of\nsilver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver\nand the hook of the door was of gold.\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with\nhis consummate skill, had fashioned expressly t'keep watch over the\npalace of king Alcinous; s'they were immortal and could never grow\nold. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end\nt'the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the\nhouse had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used t'sit\nand eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there\nwere golden figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands,\nraised on pedestals, t'give light by night t'those wh'were at table.\nThere are60 fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always\ngrinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom,\nor sit and spin, and their shuttles g'backwards and forwards like the\nfluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is s'closely woven that it\nwill turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so\ntheir women excel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them\nall manner of useful arts, and they are very intelligent.\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about\nfour acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful\ntrees\u2014pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are\nluscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor\nfail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so\nsoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on\npear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and s'als'with the grapes, for\nthere is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,\nthe grapes are being made int'raisins; in another part they are being\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on\nhave shed their blossom and are beginning t'show fruit, others again\nare just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are\nbeautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year\nround. Tw'streams g'through it, the one turned in ducts throughout\nthe whole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the\nouter court t'the house itself, and the town's people draw water from\nit. Such, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the\nhouse of king Alcinous.\nS'here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he had\nlooked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\nprecincts of the house.

A maid servant then\nbrought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it int'a\nsilver basin for him t'wash his hands, and she drew a clean table\nbeside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many\ngood things of what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank.\nThen Alcinous said t'one of the servants, \"Pontonous, mix a cup of\nwine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings t'Jove the\nlord of thunder, wh'is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants.\"\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving\nevery man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and\nhad drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\nhave had your supper, s'now g'home t'bed. To-morrow morning I shall\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\nbanquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his\nescort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing t'his\nown country without trouble or inconvenience t'himself, n'matter how\ndistant it may be. We must see that he comes t'n'harm while on his\nhomeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have t'take the\nluck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is\npossible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals wh'has\ncome down from heaven t'visit us; but in this case the gods are\ndeparting from their usual practice, for hithert'they have made\nthemselves perfectly clear t'us when we have been offering them\nhecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,\nand if any solitary wayfarer happens t'stumble upon some one or other\nof them, they affect n'concealment, for we are as near of kin t'the\ngods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\"62\nThen Ulysses said: \"Pray, Alcinous, d'not take any such notion into\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body nor\nmind, and most resemble those among you wh'are the most afflicted.\nIndeed, were I t'tell you all that heaven has seen fit t'lay upon me,\nyou would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\nlet me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very\nimportunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice n'matter how\ndire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I\nshall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and\ndwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, d'as\nyou propose, and at break of day set about helping me t'get home. I\nshall be content t'die if I may first once more behold my property, my\nbondsmen, and all the greatness of my house.\"63\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he",

Then when\nthey had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he\nwas minded they went home t'bed every man in his own abode, leaving\nUlysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were\ntaking the things away after supper. Arete was the first t'speak, for\nshe recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses was\nwearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; s'she said,\n\"Stranger, before we g'any further, there is a question I should like\nt'ask you. Who, and whence are you, and wh'gave you those clothes?\nDid you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\"\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I t'relate\nin full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been\nlaid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island\nfar away in the sea which is called 'the Ogygian.' Here dwells the\ncunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by\nherself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however,\nbrought me t'her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my\nship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave\ncomrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck t'the keel and\nwas carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last\nduring the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me t'the\nOgygian island where the great goddess Calyps'lives. She took me in\nand treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted t'make me\nimmortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to\nlet her d'so.\n\"I stayed with Calyps'seven years straight on end, and watered the\ngood clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at\nlast when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free\nwill, either because Jove had told her she must, or because she had\nchanged her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she\nprovisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good\nstout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days\nseven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught\nsight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast\u2014and glad\nindeed was I t'set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much\ntrouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me g'no\nfurther, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was s'terribly\nhigh that I could n'longer keep t'my raft, which went t'pieces under\nthe fury of the gale, and I had t'swim for it, till wind and current\nbrought me t'your shores.\n\"There I tried t'land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the\nwaves dashed me against the rocks, s'I again took t'the sea and swam\non till I came t'a river that seemed the most likely landing place,\nfor there were n'rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then,\nI got out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was\ncoming on, s'I left the river, and went int'a thicket, where I\ncovered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off\nint'a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the\nleaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke\nas the sun was westering, and saw your daughter's maid servants playing\nupon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I\nbesought her aid, and she proved t'be of an excellent disposition,\nmuch more s'than could be expected from s'young a person\u2014for young\npeople are apt t'be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine,\nand when she had had me washed in the river she als'gave me the\nclothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to\nd'so, I have told you the whole truth.\"",

When they got there they sat\ndown side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the\nform of one of Alcinous' servants, and went round the town in order to\nhelp Ulysses t'get home.

The fifty-tw'picked oarsmen went to\nthe sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew\nthe ship int'the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the\noars t'the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due\ncourse, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a\nlittle way out from land, and then came on shore and went t'the house\nof King Alcinous. The out houses,66 yards, and all the precincts were\nfilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and\nAlcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two\noxen. These they skinned and dressed s'as t'provide a magnificent\nbanquet.\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had\ndearly loved, but t'whom she had given both good and evil, for though\nshe had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of\nhis eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it\nup against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his\nhead, and showed him where he was t'feel for it with his hands. He\nals'set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup\nof wine from which he might drink whenever he was s'disposed.\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before\nthem, but as soon as they had had enough t'eat and drink, the muse\ninspired Demodocus t'sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a\nmatter that was then in the mouths of all men, t'wit, the quarrel\nbetween Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on\none another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad\nwhen he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo\nhad foretold him this at Pyth'when he crossed the stone floor to\nconsult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will\nof Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head\nand covered his face, for he was ashamed t'let the Phaeacians see that\nhe was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from\nhis eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a\ndrink-offering t'the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus\nt'sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again\ndrew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. N'one noticed his\ndistress except Alcinous, wh'was sitting near him, and heard the heavy\nsighs that he was heaving. S'he at once said, \"Aldermen and town\ncouncillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the\nfeast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us\nproceed therefore t'the athletic sports, s'that our guest on his\nreturn home may be able t'tell his friends how much we surpass all\nother nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners.\"\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after.

Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,\nPrymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus,\nand Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was als'Euryalus\nson of Naubolus, wh'was like Mars himself, and was the best looking\nman among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous,\nLaodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also.\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the\nstarting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew\nforward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he\nleft every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a\ncouple of mules can plough in a fallow field.67 They then turned t'the\npainful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved t'be the best man.\nAmphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the\ndisc there was n'one wh'could approach Elatreus. Alcinous's son\nLaodamas was the best boxer, and he it was wh'presently said, when\nthey had all been diverted with the games, \"Let us ask the stranger\nwhether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully\nbuilt; his thighs, calves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength,\nnor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is\nnothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, n'matter how strong\nhe is.\"\n\"You are quite right, Laodamas,\" replied Euryalus, \"g'up t'your guest\nand speak t'him about it yourself.\"\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way int'the middle of the crowd\nand said t'Ulysses, \"I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for\nsome one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of\nthem\u2014and you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is\nnothing that does any one s'much credit all his life long as the\nshowing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try\ntherefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your\nreturn home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn\nint'the water, and the crew is found.\"\nUlysses answered, \"Laodamas, why d'you taunt me in this way? my mind\nis set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite\ntrouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king\nand people t'further me on my return home.\"\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, \"I gather, then, that you\nare unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in.\nI suppose you are one of those grasping traders that g'about in ships\nas captains or merchants, and wh'think of nothing but of their outward\nfreights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem t'be much of the\nathlete about you.\"\n\"For shame, Sir,\" answered Ulysses, fiercely, \"you are an insolent\nfellow\u2014s'true is it that the gods d'not grace all men alike in\nspeech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but\nheaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms\nevery one wh'sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with\nhim s'that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever\nhe goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god, but\nhis good looks are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No\ngod could make a finer looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool.\nYour ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are\nquite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed,\ns'long as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of\nthe age. Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have\ngone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the\nweary sea; still, in spite of all this I will compete, for your taunts\nhave stung me t'the quick.\"\nS'he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,\nlarger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians\nwhen disc-throwing among themselves.68 Then, swinging it back, he threw\nit from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he\ndid so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it\nsped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been\nmade yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place\nwhere it had fallen. \"A blind man, Sir,\" said she, \"could easily tell\nyour mark by groping for it\u2014it is s'far ahead of any other. You may\nmake your mind easy about this contest, for n'Phaeacian can come near\nt'such a throw as yours.\"\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so\nhe began t'speak more pleasantly. \"Young men,\" said he, \"come up to\nthat throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even\nheavier. If anyone wants t'have a bout with me let him come on, for I\nam exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I d'not care what\nit is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him\nbecause I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one's own personal\nfriend. At least I d'not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a\nguest t'challenge his host's family at any game, especially when he is\nin a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under his own feet if\nhe does; but I make n'exception as regards any one else, for I want to\nhave the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at\nevery kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent\narcher. In battle I am always the first t'bring a man down with my\narrow, n'matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me.\nPhiloctetes was the only man wh'could shoot better than I could when\nwe Achaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel every one\nelse in the whole world, of those wh'still eat bread upon the face of\nthe earth, but I should not like t'shoot against the mighty dead, such\nas Hercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian\u2014men wh'could shoot against the\ngods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his\nend, for Apoll'was angry with him and killed him because he challenged\nhim as an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can\nshoot an arrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am\nafraid some of the Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought\ndown very low at sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still\nweak.\"",

I hope you will apprehend my meaning,\nand will explain t'any one of your chief men wh'may be dining with\nyourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary\naptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly\nremarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly\nfleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good\ndinners, music, and dancing; we als'like frequent changes of linen,\nwarm baths, and good beds, s'now, please, some of you wh'are the best\ndancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be\nable t'tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as\nsailors, runners, dancers, and minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre\nat my house, s'run some one or other of you and fetch it for him.\"\nOn this a servant hurried off t'bring the lyre from the king's house,\nand the nine men wh'had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was\ntheir business t'manage everything connected with the sports, s'they\nmade the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.\nPresently the servant came back with Demodocus's lyre, and he took his\nplace in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town\nbegan t'foot and trip it s'nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the\nmerry twinkling of their feet.\nMeanwhile the bard began t'sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how\nthey first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus\nmany presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, s'the sun, who\nsaw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he\nheard such dreadful news, s'he went t'his smithy brooding mischief,\ngot his great anvil int'its place, and began t'forge some chains\nwhich none could either unloose or break, s'that they might stay there\nin that place.69 When he had finished his snare he went int'his\nbedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs;\nhe als'let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even\na god could see them s'fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had\nspread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting\nout for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was\nthe one he was most fond of. But Mars kept n'blind look out, and as\nsoon as he saw him start, hurried off t'his house, burning with love\nfor Venus.\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit t'her father Jove, and was\nabout sitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took\nher hand in his own, \"Let us g't'the couch of Vulcan: he is not at\nhome, but is gone off t'Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is\nbarbarous.\"\nShe was nothing loth, s'they went t'the couch t'take their rest,\nwhereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread\nfor them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too\nlate that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up t'them, for he had\nturned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him\nwhat was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the\nvestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted t'all the gods.\n\"Father Jove,\" he cried, \"and all you other blessed gods wh'live for\never, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I\nwill show you. Jove's daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because\nI am lame. She is in love with Mars, wh'is handsome and clean built,\nwhereas I am a cripple\u2014but my parents are t'blame for that, not I;\nthey ought never t'have begotten me. Come and see the pair together\nasleep on my bed. It makes me furious t'look at them. They are very\nfond of one another, but I d'not think they will lie there longer than\nthey can help, nor d'I think that they will sleep much; there,\nhowever, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave\nhim for his baggage of a daughter, wh'is fair but not honest.\"\nOn this the gods gathered t'the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling\nNeptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the\ngoddesses staid at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all\ngood things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with\ninextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,\nwhereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:\n\"Ill deeds d'not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how\nlimping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars wh'is the fleetest god\nin heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.\"\nThus did they converse, but King Apoll'said t'Mercury, \"Messenger\nMercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains\nwere, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?\"\n\"King Apollo,\" answered Mercury, \"I only wish I might get the chance,\nthough there were three times as many chains\u2014and you might look on, all\nof you, gods and goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could.\"\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune\ntook it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan t'set Mars free\nagain. \"Let him go,\" he cried, \"and I will undertake, as you require,\nthat he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among\nthe immortal gods.\"\n\"D'not,\" replied Vulcan, \"ask me t'd'this; a bad man's bond is bad\nsecurity; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go\naway and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?\"\n\"Vulcan,\" said Neptune, \"if Mars goes away without paying his damages,\nI will pay you myself.\" S'Vulcan answered, \"In this case I cannot and\nmust not refuse you.\"\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were\nfree they scampered off, Mars t'Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to\nCyprus and t'Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with\nburnt offerings. Here the Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil\nof ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her\nin raiment of the most enchanting beauty.\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were\ncharmed as they heard him.",

            "text": "Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius t'dance alone, for there was no\none t'compete with them. S'they took a red ball which Polybus had\nmade for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up\ntowards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and\ncaught it with ease before it came down again. When they had done\nthrowing the ball straight up int'the air they began t'dance, and at\nthe same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards t'one\nanother, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great\nstamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:\n\"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the\nworld, and indeed they have proved themselves t'be so. I was\nastonished as I saw them.\"\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed t'the Phaeacians,\n\"Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems t'be a person of\nsingular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he\nmay reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and\ncounting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean\ncloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in\na lump down at once, s'that when he gets his supper he may d's'with\na light heart. As for Euryalus he will have t'make a formal apology\nand a present too, for he has been rude.\"\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and\nsent their servants t'fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, \"King\nAlcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He\nshall have my sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of\nsilver. I will als'give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into\nwhich it fits. It will be worth a great deal t'him.\"\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, \"Good\nluck t'you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the\nwinds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return,\nfor I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone\nthrough much hardship.\"\nT'which Ulysses answered, \"Good luck t'you to'my friend, and may the\ngods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you\nhave given me along with your apology.\"\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards\nsundown the presents began t'make their appearance, as the servants of\nthe donors kept bringing them t'the house of King Alcinous; here his\nsons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge. Then\nAlcinous led the way t'the house and bade his guests take their seats.\n\"Wife,\" said he, turning t'Queen Arete, \"Go, fetch the best chest we\nhave, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the\nfire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see als'to\nthe careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made\nhim; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that\nwill follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet\u2014which is of\nexquisite workmanship\u2014that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his\nlife whenever he makes a drink offering t'Jove, or t'any of the\ngods.\"70\nThen Arete told her maids t'set a large tripod upon the fire as fast\nas they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on t'a\nclear fire; they threw on sticks t'make it blaze, and the water became\nhot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.71 Meanwhile\nArete brought a magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it she\npacked all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the\nPhaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from\nAlcinous, and said t'Ulysses:\n\"See t'the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for\nfear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your\nship.\" 72\nWhen Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast\nwith a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done s'before an upper\nservant told him t'come t'the bath and wash himself. He was very glad\nof a warm bath, for he had had n'one t'wait upon him ever since he\nleft the house of Calypso, wh'as long as he remained with her had\ntaken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the\nservants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him\na clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests\nwh'were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the\nbearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, and admired him as\nshe saw him pass. \"Farewell stranger,\" said she, \"d'not forget me when\nyou are safe at home again, for it is t'me first that you owe a ransom\nfor having saved your life.\"\nAnd Ulysses said, \"Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove the\nmighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; s'shall I\nbless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you wh'saved\nme.\"\nWhen he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was\nthen served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the\nfavourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near\none of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean\nagainst it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of\nfat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said t'a servant,\n\"Take this piece of pork over t'Demodocus and tell him t'eat it; for\nall the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less;\nbards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse\nteaches them their songs and loves them.\"\nThe servant carried the pork in his fingers over t'Demodocus, wh'took\nit and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good\nthings that were before them, and as soon as they had had t'eat and\ndrink, Ulysses said t'Demodocus, \"Demodocus, there is n'one in the\nworld whom I admire more than I d'you. You must have studied under the\nMuse, Jove's daughter, and under Apollo, s'accurately d'you sing the\nreturn of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you\nwere not there yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who\nwas. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse\nwhich Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got\nby stratagem int'the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who\nafterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will\ntell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.\"\nThe bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some\nof the Argives set fire t'their tents and sailed away while others,\nhidden within the horse,73 were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan\nplace of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into\ntheir fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it,\nand were in three minds as t'what they should do. Some were for\nbreaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged t'the top\nof the rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the\nprecipice; while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering\nand propitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the\nend, for the city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which\nwere all the bravest of the Argives waiting t'bring death and\ndestruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans\nissued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their\nambuscade. He sang how they overran the city hither and thither and\nravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus\nt'the house of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most\nfuriously, nevertheless by Minerva's help he was victorious.\nAll this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his\ncheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws\nherself on the body of her husband wh'has fallen before his own city\nand people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She\nscreams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for\nbreath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back\nand shoulders, and carry her off int'slavery, t'a life of labour and\nsorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks\u2014even s'piteously did\nUlysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except\nAlcinous, wh'was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs\nthat he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease\nhis song, for there are those present wh'd'not seem t'like it. From\nthe moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began t'sing, our\nguest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in\ngreat trouble, s'let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy\nourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should\nbe, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we\nare making with s'much good will are wholly in his honour, and any one\nwith even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to\ntreat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.\n\"Therefore, Sir, d'you on your part affect n'more concealment nor\nreserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more\npolite in you t'give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your\nfather and mother over yonder used t'call you, and by which you were\nknown among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is n'one,\nneither rich nor poor, wh'is absolutely without any name whatever, for\npeople's fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.\nTell me als'your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape\ntheir purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have\nn'pilots; their vessels have n'rudders as those of other nations\nhave, but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are\nthinking about and want; they know all the cities and countries in the\nwhole world, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is\ncovered with mist and cloud, s'that there is n'danger of being\nwrecked or coming t'any harm. Still I d'remember hearing my father\nsay that Neptune was angry with us for being to'easy-going in the\nmatter of giving people escorts. He said that one of these days he\nshould wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted\nsome one,74 and bury our city under a high mountain. This is what my\nfather used t'say, but whether the god will carry out his threat or no\nis a matter which he will decide for himself.\n\"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and\nin what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples\nthemselves, and of their cities\u2014wh'were hostile, savage and\nuncivilised, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us\nals'why you are made s'unhappy on hearing about the return of the\nArgive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them\ntheir misfortunes in order that future generations might have something\nt'sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife's when you",

There is nothing better or\nmore delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the\nguests sitting orderly t'listen, while the table is loaded with bread\nand meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every\nman. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however,\nsince you are inclined t'ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my\nown sad memories in respect of them, I d'not know how t'begin, nor\nyet how t'continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has\nbeen laid heavily upon me.\n\"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you to'may know it, and\none day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though\nI live s'far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes,\nrenowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, s'that my fame\nascends t'heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain\ncalled Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a\ngroup of islands very near t'one another\u2014Dulichium, Same, and the\nwooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest\nup in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it\ntowards dawn.75 It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my\neyes know none that they better love t'look upon. The goddess Calypso\nkept me with her in her cave, and wanted me t'marry her, as did also\nthe cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them\npersuade me, for there is nothing dearer t'a man than his own country\nand his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a foreign\ncountry, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it.\nNow, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by\nJove's will I met with on my return from Troy.",

When\nwe got t'the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff\nnear the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a\nstation for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large\nyard, with a high wall round it made of stones built int'the ground\nand of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster\nwh'was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He would have\nnothing t'd'with other people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was\na horrid creature, not like a human being at all, but resembling rather\nsome crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high",

I\nals'took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by\nMaron, son of Euanthes, wh'was priest of Apoll'the patron god of\nIsmarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we\nwere sacking the city we respected him, and spared his life, as also\nhis wife and child; s'he made me some presents of great value\u2014seven\ntalents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet\nwine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid\nin the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife, and one\nhousekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water t'one of\nwine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was s'exquisite that\nit was impossible t'refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with\nthis wine, and took a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind\nmisgave me that I might have t'deal with some savage wh'would be of\ngreat strength, and would respect neither right nor law.\n\"We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, s'we went\ninside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were\nloaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could\nhold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets,\nthen the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones80\nall kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels,\nbowls, and milk pails int'which he milked, were swimming with whey.\nWhen they saw all this, my men begged me t'let them first steal some\ncheeses, and make off with them t'the ship; they would then return,\ndrive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with\nthem. It would have been indeed better if we had done s'but I would\nnot listen t'them, for I wanted t'see the owner himself, in the hope\nthat he might give me a present. When, however, we saw him my poor men\nfound him ill t'deal with.\n\"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others of\nthem, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his\nsheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood\nt'light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise\non t'the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far\nend of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as\nthe she-goats that he was going t'milk, leaving the males, both rams\nand he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone t'the\nmouth of the cave\u2014s'huge that tw'and twenty strong four-wheeled\nwaggons would not be enough t'draw it from its place against the\ndoorway. When he had s'done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats,\nall in due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He\ncurdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the\nother half he poured int'bowls that he might drink it for his supper.\nWhen he had got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then\ncaught sight of us, whereon he said:\n\"'Strangers, wh'are you? Where d'sail from? Are you traders, or do\nyou sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and\nevery man's hand against you?'\n\"We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous\nform, but I managed t'say, 'We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,\nbut by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far\nout of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who\nhas won infinite renown throughout the whole world, by sacking s'great\na city and killing s'many people. We therefore humbly pray you t'show\nus some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors\nmay reasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven,\nfor we are your suppliants, and Jove takes all respectable travellers\nunder his protection, for he is the avenger of all suppliants and\nforeigners in distress.'\n\"T'this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said he, 'you\nare a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk t'me,\nindeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do\nnot care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so\nmuch stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your\ncompanions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for\ndoing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came\non shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the\nland?'\n\"He said this t'draw me out, but I was to'cunning t'be caught in\nthat way, s'I answered with a lie; 'Neptune,' said I, 'sent my ship on\nt'the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were\ndriven on t'them from the open sea, but I and those wh'are with me\nescaped the jaws of death.'\n\"The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a\nsudden clutch he gripped up tw'of my men at once and dashed them down\nupon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed\nupon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore\nthem limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a\nlion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without\nleaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to\nheaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to\ndo; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed\ndown his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched\nhimself full length upon the ground among his sheep, and went t'sleep.",

S'we stayed sobbing and sighing where we\nwere till morning came.\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit\nhis fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let\neach have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his\nwork, he clutched up tw'more of my men, and began eating them for his\nmorning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone\naway from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back\nagain\u2014as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on t'a\nquiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done s'he shouted, and cried\n'Shoo, shoo,' after his sheep t'drive them on t'the mountain; s'I\nwas left t'scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself\nwith glory.\n\"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan t'd'as follows: The\nCyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it\nwas of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending t'use it for a\nstaff as soon as it should be dry. It was s'huge that we could only\ncompare it t'the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large\nburden, and able t'venture out int'open sea. I went up t'this club\nand cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece t'the men and\ntold them t'fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded t'do,\nand lastly I brought it t'a point myself, charring the end in the fire\nt'make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was\nlying about all over the cave, and told the men t'cast lots which of\nthem should venture along with myself t'lift it and bore it int'the\nmonster's eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom\nI should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch\ncame back from shepherding, and drove his flocks int'the cave\u2014this\ntime driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I\nsuppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him\nt'd'so. As soon as he had put the stone back t'its place against the\ndoor, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and\nthen let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all\nthis work, he gripped up tw'more of my men, and made his supper off\nthem. S'I went up t'him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my\nhands:\n\"'Look here, Cyclops,' said I, you have been eating a great deal of\nman's flesh, s'take this and drink some wine, that you may see what\nkind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it t'you as a\ndrink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and\nfurther me on my way home, whereas all you d'is t'g'on ramping and\nraving most intolerably. You ought t'be ashamed of yourself; how can\nyou expect people t'come see you any more if you treat them in this\nway?'\n\"He then took the cup and drank. He was s'delighted with the taste of\nthe wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'Be s'kind,' he\nsaid, 'as t'give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want\nt'make you a present that you will be glad t'have. We have wine even\nin this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but\nthis drinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.'\n\"I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,\nand three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I\nsaw that the wine had got int'his head, I said t'him as plausibly as\nI could: 'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me,\ntherefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what\nmy father and mother and my friends have always called me.'\n\"But the cruel wretch said, 'Then I will eat all Noman's comrades\nbefore Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the\npresent that I will make him.'\n\"As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.\nHis great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon\nhim. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets\nof human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk.\nThen I thrust the beam of wood far int'the embers t'heat it, and\nencouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the\nwood, green though it was, was about t'blaze, I drew it out of the\nfire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had\nfilled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam\nint'the monster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept\nturning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship's\nplank with an auger, which tw'men with a wheel and strap can keep on\nturning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam\nint'his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked\nit round and round, s'that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded\nhis eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the\nfire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet int'cold water to\ntemper it\u2014for it is this that gives strength t'the iron\u2014and it makes a\ngreat hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops' eye hiss round the\nbeam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We\nran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore\nfrom his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain,\nshouting as he did s't'the other Cyclopes wh'lived on the bleak\nheadlands near him; s'they gathered from all quarters round his cave\nwhen they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with him.\n\"'What ails you, Polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such a noise,\nbreaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able\nt'sleep? Surely n'man is carrying off your sheep? Surely n'man is\ntrying t'kill you either by fraud or by force?'\n\"But Polyphemus shouted t'them from inside the cave, 'Noman is killing\nme by fraud; n'man is killing me by force.'\n\"'Then,' said they, 'if n'man is attacking you, you must be ill; when\nJove makes people ill, there is n'help for it, and you had better pray\nt'your father Neptune.'\n\"Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my\nclever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,\nfelt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the\ndoor; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it\nt'catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be\nfoolish enough t'attempt this.\n\"As for myself I kept on puzzling t'think how I could best save my own\nlife and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who\nknows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In\nthe end I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were\nwell grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, s'I bound them\nnoiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which the\nwicked monster used t'sleep. There was t'be a man under the middle\nsheep, and the tw'on either side were t'cover him, s'that there were\nthree sheep t'each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any\nof the others, s'I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in\nthe thick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently t'his fleece,\nface upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the time.\n\"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but\nwhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep\nhurried out t'feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens\nwaiting t'be milked, for their udders were full t'bursting; but their\nmaster in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they\nstood upright, without being sharp enough t'find out that the men were\nunderneath their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy\nwith its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self, Polyphemus laid\nhold of it and said:\n\"'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last t'leave my cave this\nmorning? You are not wont t'let the ewes g'before you, but lead the\nmob with a run whether t'flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are\nthe first t'come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is\nit because you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because\nthat wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and\nblinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and\ntalk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash\nhis brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should\nthus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done\nme.'\n\"As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way\nout from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly,\nand then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by\nconstantly heading them in the right direction we managed t'drive them\ndown t'the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who\nhad escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed.\nHowever, I made signs t'them by nodding and frowning that they were to\nhush their crying, and told them t'get all the sheep on board at once\nand put out t'sea; s'they went aboard, took their places, and smote\nthe grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my\nvoice would reach, I began t'jeer at the Cyclops.\n\"'Cyclops,' said I, 'you should have taken better measure of your man\nbefore eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your\nvisitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would\nfind you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.'\n\"He got more and more furious as he heard me, s'he tore the top from\noff a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship s'that it\nwas within a little of hitting the end of the rudder.81 The sea quaked\nas the rock fell int'it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us\nback towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But I\nsnatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs t'my men\nby nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they\nlaid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I\nwas for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of\nme t'hold my tongue.\n\"'D'not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough t'provoke this savage\ncreature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us\nback again t'the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of\nus; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have\npounded our heads and our ship's timbers int'a jelly with the rugged\nrocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.'\n\"But I would not listen t'them, and shouted out t'him in my rage,\n'Cyclops, if any one asks you wh'it was that put your eye out and\nspoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of\nLaertes, wh'lives in Ithaca.'",

There was a prophet here, at one time, a man\nboth brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, wh'was an\nexcellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he\ngrew old; he told me that all this would happen t'me some day, and\nsaid I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all\nalong expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength,\nwhereas he turns out t'be a little insignificant weakling, wh'has\nmanaged t'blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come\nhere, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents t'show my\nhospitality, and urge Neptune t'help you forward on your journey\u2014for\nNeptune and I are father and son. He, if he s'will, shall heal me,\nwhich n'one else neither god nor man can do.'\n\"Then I said, 'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and\nsending you down t'the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more\nthan Neptune t'cure that eye of yours.'\n\"On this he lifted up his hands t'the firmament of heaven and prayed,\nsaying, 'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten\nson, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must\nget back t'his friends at last, let him d's'late and in sore plight\nafter losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man's ship\nand find trouble in his house.'82\n\"Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a\nrock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with\nprodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock\nfell int'it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on\nour way towards the shore of the island.\n\"When at last we got t'the island where we had left the rest of our\nships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our\nreturn. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on t'the\nsea shore; we als'landed the Cyclops' sheep, and divided them\nequitably amongst us s'that none might have reason t'complain. As for\nthe ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share;\ns'I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to\nJove, wh'is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only\nthought how he might destroy both my ships and my comrades.\n\"Thus through the livelong day t'the going down of the sun we feasted\nour fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on\ndark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning rosy-fingered\nDawn appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they\ntook their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; s'we sailed\non with sorrow in our hearts, but glad t'have escaped death though we\nhad lost our comrades.",

Then, hide all\nyour ship's gear and property in some cave, and come back here with\nyour men.'\n\"I agreed t'this, s'I went back t'the sea shore, and found the men\nat the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the\nsilly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out\nand gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home t'be\nmilked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds\nwith their lowing. They seemed as glad t'see me as though they had got\nback t'their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred.\n'Sir,' said the affectionate creatures, 'we are as glad t'see you back\nas though we had got safe home t'Ithaca; but tell us all about the\nfate of our comrades.'\n\"I spoke comfortingly t'them and said, 'We must draw our ship on to\nthe land, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave;\nthen come with me all of you as fast as you can t'Circe's house, where\nyou will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great\nabundance.'\n\"On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried\nt'hold them back and said, 'Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will\nbecome of us? Rush not on your ruin by going t'the house of Circe, who\nwill turn us all int'pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to\nkeep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our\ncomrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It was all\nthrough his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'\n\"When I heard him I was in tw'minds whether or n't'draw the keen\nblade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of his\nbeing a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him and\nsaid, 'Sir, if it may s'be, let this fellow stay here and mind the\nship, but take the rest of us with you t'Circe's house.'\n\"On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after\nall, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand\nthat I had given him.\n\"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men wh'had been left behind\nwere washed and anointed with olive oil; she had als'given them\nwoollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all\ncomfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other\nface t'face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud\ntill the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up t'me and said,\n'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men t'leave off crying; I\nknow how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have\nfared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so\nstay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and\nhearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you are\nweakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking of the\nhardships you have suffered during your travels, s'that you have no\nmore cheerfulness left in you.'\n\"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole\ntwelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But\nwhen the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had\ncome round, my men called me apart and said, 'Sir, it is time you began\nt'think about going home, if s'be you are t'be spared t'see your\nhouse and native country at all.'\n\"Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day\nt'the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but\nwhen the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down\nt'sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got int'bed\nwith Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened t'what\nI had got t'say. 'Circe,' said I, 'please t'keep the promise you made\nme about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want t'get back and so\nd'my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon\nas ever your back is turned.'\n\"And the goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall\nnone of you stay here any longer if you d'not want to, but there is\nanother journey which you have got t'take before you can sail\nhomewards. You must g't'the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to\nconsult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias, whose reason\nis still unshaken. T'him alone has Proserpine left his understanding\neven in death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.'",

I sat up in bed and wept, and would\ngladly have lived n'longer t'see the light of the sun, but presently\nwhen I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, 'And who\nshall guide me upon this voyage\u2014for the house of Hades is a port that\nn'ship can reach.'\n\"'You will want n'guide,' she answered; 'raise your mast, set your\nwhite sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of\nitself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will\nreach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves of tall\npoplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your\nship upon the shore of Oceanus, and g'straight on t'the dark abode of\nHades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon\nand Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow int'Acheron,\nand you will see a rock near it, just where the tw'roaring rivers run\nint'one another.\n\"'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a\ncubit or s'in length, breadth, and depth, and pour int'it as a\ndrink-offering t'all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then\nwine, and in the third place water\u2014sprinkling white barley meal over\nthe whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers t'the poor feeble\nghosts, and promise them that when you get back t'Ithaca you will\nsacrifice a barren heifer t'them, the best you have, and will load the\npyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that\nTeiresias shall have a black sheep all t'himself, the finest in all\nyour flocks.\n\"'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer\nthem a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but\nyourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the\nriver. On this, many dead men's ghosts will come t'you, and you must\ntell your men t'skin the tw'sheep that you have just killed, and\noffer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers t'Hades and to\nProserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, s'as t'prevent any\nother poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias\nshall have answered your questions. The seer will presently come to\nyou, and will tell you about your voyage\u2014what stages you are t'make,\nand how you are t'sail the sea s'as t'reach your home.'\n\"It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, s'she dressed me\nin my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light\ngossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle\nround her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went\nabout among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to\neach of them man by man: 'You must not lie sleeping here any longer,'\nsaid I t'them, 'we must be going, for Circe has told me all about it.'\nAnd on this they did as I bade them.\n\"Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had\nwith us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or\ncourage, wh'had got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the\nrest of the men, t'sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the\nnoise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot\nall about coming down by the main staircase, s'he tumbled right off\nthe roof and broke his neck, and his soul went down t'the house of\nHades.\n\"When I had got the men together I said t'them, 'You think you are\nabout t'start home again, but Circe has explained t'me that instead\nof this, we have got t'g't'the house of Hades and Proserpine to\nconsult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.'\n\"The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves on\nthe ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend\nmatters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting\nour fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard\nby the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it,\nfor wh'can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not",

Then she knew me at once and\nspoke fondly t'me, saying, 'My son, how did you come down t'this\nabode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for the\nliving t'see these places, for between us and them there are great and\nterrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which n'man can cross on foot,\nbut he must have a good ship t'take him. Are you all this time trying\nt'find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to\nIthaca nor seen your wife in your own house?'\n\"'Mother,' said I, 'I was forced t'come here t'consult the ghost of\nthe Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean\nland nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one\nlong series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with\nAgamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, t'fight the Trojans.\nBut tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did you have a\nlong illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to\neternity? Tell me als'about my father, and the son whom I left behind\nme, is my property still in their hands, or has some one else got hold\nof it, wh'thinks that I shall not return t'claim it? Tell me again\nwhat my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with\nmy son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she\ncould and married again?'\n\"My mother answered, 'Your wife still remains in your house, but she is\nin great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night\nand day. N'one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and\nTelemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has t'entertain\nlargely, as of course he must, considering his position as a\nmagistrate,92 and how every one invites him; your father remains at his\nold place in the country and never goes near the town. He has no\ncomfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in\nfront of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in\nsummer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the\nvineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown any how upon the ground. He\ngrieves continually about your never having come home, and suffers more\nand more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in this wise:\nheaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was\nI attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear people out\nand kill them, but my longing t'know what you were doing and the force\nof my affection for you\u2014this it was that was the death of me.'93",

S'they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned\nher told me her race and lineage.\n\"The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of\nCretheus the son of Aeolus.94 She fell in love with the river Enipeus\nwh'is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she\nwas taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her\nlover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave\narched itself like a mountain over them t'hide both woman and god,\nwhereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.\nWhen the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his\nown and said, 'Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods\nare not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time twelve\nmonths. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, s'now g'home, but hold\nyour tongue and d'not tell any one.'\n\"Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and\nNeleus, wh'both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a\ngreat breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in\nPylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson,\nPheres, and Amythaon, wh'was a mighty warrior and charioteer.\n\"Next t'her I saw Antiope, daughter t'Asopus, wh'could boast of\nhaving slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and wh'bore him two\nsons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and\nbuilt a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not\nhold Thebes till they had walled it.\n\"Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, wh'als'bore t'Jove\nindomitable Hercules; and Megara wh'was daughter t'great King Creon,\nand married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.\n\"I als'saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it\nwas t'marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after\nhaving killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to\nthe world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the\nspite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went t'the house of the\nmighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging\nspirits haunted him as for an outraged mother\u2014t'his ruing bitterly\nthereafter.\n\"Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given\npriceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter t'Amphion son of\nIasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore\nNestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she als'bore that marvellously\nlovely woman Pero, wh'was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus\nwould only give her t'him wh'should raid the cattle of Iphicles from\nthe grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The only man\nwh'would undertake t'raid them was a certain excellent seer,95 but\nthe will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle\ncaught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full year had\npassed and the same season came round again, Iphicles set him at\nliberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, then,\nwas the will of Jove accomplished.\n\"And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, wh'bore him tw'famous sons,\nCastor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these\nheroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a\nspecial dispensation of Jove, they die and come t'life again, each one\nof them every other day throughout all time, and they have the rank of\ngods.\n\"After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus wh'boasted the embrace of\nNeptune. She bore tw'sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short\nlived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,\nand the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they\nwere nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They\nthreatened t'make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried t'set Mount\nOssa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa,\nthat they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it to'if\nthey had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them,\nbefore they had got s'much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or\nchin.\n\"Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the\nmagician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete t'Athens, but\nhe did not enjoy her, for before he could d's'Diana killed her in the\nisland of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.\n\"I als'saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, wh'sold her own\nhusband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were t'name\nevery single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and\nit is time for me t'g't'bed, either on board ship with my crew, or",

Moreover you have told the story of your own\nmisfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practiced\nbard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty\nheroes wh'went t'Troy at the same time with yourself, and perished\nthere. The evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet bed\ntime\u2014g'on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay here\nlistening till tomorrow morning, s'long as you will continue t'tell\nus of your adventures.\"\n\"Alcinous,\" answered Ulysses, \"there is a time for making speeches, and\na time for going t'bed; nevertheless, since you s'desire, I will not\nrefrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades\nwh'did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but perished on their\nreturn, through the treachery of a wicked woman.\n\"When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the\nghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up t'me, surrounded by\nthose wh'had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as\nhe had tasted the blood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out\nhis arms towards me t'embrace me; but he had n'strength nor substance\nany more, and I to'wept and pitied him as I beheld him. 'How did you\ncome by your death,' said I, 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his\nwinds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies\nmake an end of you on the main land when you were cattle-lifting or\nsheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of their wives\nand city?'\n\"'Ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea\nin any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the\nmainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between\nthem. He asked me t'his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most\nmiserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all\naround me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding\nbreakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You\nmust have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement, or\nin single combat, but you never saw anything s'truly pitiable as the\nway in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the\nloaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I\nheard Priam's daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her\nclose beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body,\nand raised my hands t'kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped\naway from me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was\ndying, for there is nothing in this world s'cruel and s'shameless as\na woman when she has fallen int'such guilt as hers was. Fancy\nmurdering her own husband! I thought I was going t'be welcomed home by\nmy children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought\ndisgrace on herself and all women wh'shall come after\u2014even on the good\nones.'\n\"And I said, 'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to\nlast in the matter of their women's counsels. See how many of us fell\nfor Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief\nagainst you to'during your absence.'\n\"'Be sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, 'and not be to'friendly\neven with your own wife. D'not tell her all that you know perfectly\nwell yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about\nthe rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely t'murder you, for\nPenelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We\nleft her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for\nTroy. This child n'doubt is now grown up happily t'man's estate,96\nand he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one\nanother as it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not\neven allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I\ncould d'so. Furthermore I say\u2014and lay my saying t'your heart\u2014d'not\ntell people when you are bringing your ship t'Ithaca, but steal a\nmarch upon them, for after all this there is n'trusting women. But now\ntell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes?\nIs he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with Menelaus\u2014for\nI presume that he is still living.'\n\"And I said, 'Agamemnon, why d'you ask me?

As for you, Achilles, n'one was ever yet so\nfortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by\nall us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are here you\nare a great prince among the dead.

In our councils of war before Troy he was always\nfirst t'speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the\nonly tw'wh'could surpass him; and when it came t'fighting on the\nplain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men, but\nwould dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many a man\ndid he kill in battle\u2014I cannot name every single one of those whom he\nslew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how\nhe killed that valiant her'Eurypylus son of Telephus, wh'was the\nhandsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others als'of the\nCeteians fell around him by reason of a woman's bribes. Moreover, when\nall the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus had\nmade, and it was left t'me t'settle when we should either open the\ndoor of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders and\nchief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every\nlimb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he\nwas all the time urging me t'break out from the horse\u2014grasping the\nhandle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury\nagainst the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his\nhandsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the\nfortune of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear\nnor in close combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.'\n\"When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a\nmeadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the\nprowess of his son.\n\"The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own\nmelancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof\u2014still\nangry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour\nof Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners\nand Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never gained the day in\nsuch a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, wh'was foremost of all\nthe Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in stature and prowess.\n\"When I saw him I tried t'pacify him and said, 'Ajax, will you not\nforget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that\nhateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to\nlose such a tower of strength as you were t'us. We mourned you as much\nas we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid\non anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danaans, for\nit was this that made him counsel your destruction\u2014come hither,\ntherefore, bring your proud spirit int'subjection, and hear what I can\ntell you.'\n\"He would not answer, but turned away t'Erebus and t'the other\nghosts; nevertheless, I should have made him talk t'me in spite of his\nbeing s'angry, or I should have gone on talking t'him,97 only that\nthere were still others among the dead whom I desired t'see.\n\"Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand\nsitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting\nand standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, t'learn his\nsentences upon them.",

            "text": "ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from\nthe others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our\nadventures.\n\"'S'far s'good,' said she, when I had ended my story, 'and now pay\nattention t'what I am about t'tell you\u2014heaven itself, indeed, will\nrecall it t'your recollection. First you will come t'the Sirens who\nenchant all wh'come near them. If any one unwarily draws in to'close\nand hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never\nwelcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to\ndeath with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead\nmen's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them.\nTherefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears with wax that\nnone of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for you\nmay get the men t'bind you as you stand upright on a cross piece half\nway up the mast,99 and they must lash the rope's ends t'the mast\nitself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and\npray the men t'unloose you, then they must bind you faster.\n\"'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you\ncoherent directions100 as t'which of tw'courses you are t'take; I\nwill lay the tw'alternatives before you, and you must consider them\nfor yourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against\nwhich the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the\nblessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may\npass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia t'Father Jove,\nbut the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove has\nt'send another t'make up their number; n'ship that ever yet came to\nthese rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire\nare freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only\nvessel that ever sailed and got through, was the famous Arg'on her way\nfrom the house of Aetes, and she to'would have gone against these\ngreat rocks, only that Jun'piloted her past them for the love she bore\nt'Jason.\n\"'Of these tw'rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a\ndark cloud. This never leaves it, s'that the top is never clear not\neven in summer and early autumn. N'man though he had twenty hands and\ntwenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer\nup, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle of it there\nis a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must\ntake your ship this way, but the cave is s'high up that not even the\nstoutest archer could send an arrow int'it. Inside it Scylla sits and\nyelps with a voice that you might take t'be that of a young hound, but\nin truth she is a dreadful monster and n'one\u2014not even a god\u2014could face\nher without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet, and\nsix necks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck\nshe has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very\nclose together, s'that they would crunch any one t'death in a moment,\nand she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and\npeering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any\nlarger monster that she can catch, of the thousands with which\nAmphitrite teems. N'ship ever yet got past her without losing some\nmen, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries off a man in\neach mouth.\n\"'You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are s'close\ntogether that there is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large\nfig tree in full leaf101 grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking\nwhirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her\nwaters, and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not\nthere when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not\nsave you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you\ncan, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.'\n\"'Is there n'way,' said I, 'of escaping Charybdis, and at the same\ntime keeping Scylla off when she is trying t'harm my men?'\n\"'You dare devil,' replied the goddess, 'you are always wanting to\nfight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even\nby the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage,\nextreme, rude, cruel and invincible. There is n'help for it; your best\nchance will be t'get by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle\nabout her rock while you are putting on your armour, she may catch you\nwith a second cast of her six heads, and snap up another half dozen of\nyour men; s'drive your ship past her at full speed, and roar out\nlustily t'Crataiis wh'is Scylla's dam, bad luck t'her; she will then\nstop her from making a second raid upon you.'\n\"'You will now come t'the Thrinacian island, and here you will see\nmany herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging t'the sun-god\u2014seven\nherds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each\nflock. They d'not breed, nor d'they become fewer in number, and they\nare tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, wh'are children of\nthe sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them\nand had done suckling them sent them t'the Thrinacian island, which\nwas a long way off, t'live there and look after their father's flocks\nand herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but\ngetting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you\nharm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and\nof your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will\nreturn late, in bad plight, after losing all your men.'",

As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when\nit is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the top of\nthe rocks on either side. When she began t'suck again, we could see\nthe water all inside whirling round and round, and it made a deafening\nsound as it broke against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the\nwhirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were at their wits\nends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and were expecting\neach moment t'be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and\nsnatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and\nmen, and in a moment I saw their hands and feet ever s'high above me,\nstruggling in the air as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them\ncall out my name in one last despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated,\nspear in hand, upon some jutting rock104 throws bait int'the water to\ndeceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with\nwhich his spear is shod, throwing them gasping on t'the land as he\ncatches them one by one\u2014even s'did Scylla land these panting creatures\non her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they\nscreamed and stretched out their hands t'me in their mortal agony.\nThis was the most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.\n\"When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible",

            "text": "\"The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an\ninsolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very\nstrong yourself and never get worn out; you seem t'be made of iron,\nand now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you\nwill not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this\nisland, but bid them put out t'sea and g'faring fruitlessly on\nthrough the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the winds\nblow hardest and d's'much damage; how can we escape should one of\nthose sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which s'often\nwreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now,\ntherefore, let us obey the behests of night and prepare our supper here\nhard by the ship; to-morrow morning we will g'on board again and put\nout t'sea.'\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that\nheaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me t'yield, for you\nare many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his\nsolemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of\nsheep, he will not be s'mad as t'kill a single head of either, but\nwill be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.'\n\"They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath\nwe made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh\nwater, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as\nthey had had enough t'eat and drink, they began talking about their\npoor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them\nweeping and they went on crying till they fell off int'a sound sleep.\n\"In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their\nplaces, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane s'that\nland and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out\nof the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,\nappeared, we brought the ship t'land and drew her int'a cave wherein\nthe sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the men\ntogether in council.\n\"'My friends,' said I, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let us\nmind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it;\nfor these cattle and sheep belong t'the mighty sun, wh'sees and gives\near t'everything.' And again they promised that they would obey.\n\"For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was\nn'other wind, but only South and East.105 As long as corn and wine\nheld out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,\nhowever, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to\ng'further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking\nwhatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One\nday, therefore, I went up inland that I might pray heaven t'show me\nsome means of getting away. When I had gone far enough t'be clear of\nall my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from the\nwind, I washed my hands and prayed t'all the gods in Olympus till by\nand by they sent me off int'a sweet sleep.\n\"Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel t'the men, 'Listen\nt'me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there\nis none s'bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these\ncows and offer them in sacrifice t'the immortal gods? If we ever get\nback t'Ithaca, we can build a fine temple t'the sun-god and enrich it\nwith every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined t'sink our\nship out of revenge for these horned cattle, and the other gods are of\nthe same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and\nhave done with it, than be starved t'death by inches in such a desert\nisland as this is.'\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle,\ns'fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men,\ntherefore, drove in the best of them, and they all stood round them\nsaying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of\nbarley-meal, for there was n'barley left. When they had done praying\nthey killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the\nthigh bones, wrapped them round in tw'layers of fat, and set some\npieces of raw meat on top of them. They had n'wine with which t'make\ndrink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, s'they kept\npouring on a little water from time t'time while the inward meats were\nbeing grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned and they had\ntasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces\nupon the spits.\n\"By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back t'the ship\nand t'the sea shore. As I drew near I began t'smell hot roast meat,\ns'I groaned out a prayer t'the immortal gods. 'Father Jove,' I\nexclaimed, 'and all you other gods wh'live in everlasting bliss, you\nhave done me a cruel mischief by the sleep int'which you have sent me;\nsee what fine work these men of mine have been making in my absence.'\n\"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off t'the sun and told him we had\nbeen killing his cows, whereon he flew int'a great rage, and said to\nthe immortals, 'Father Jove, and all you other gods wh'live in\neverlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses' ship:\nthey have had the insolence t'kill my cows, which were the one thing I\nloved t'look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. If\nthey d'not square accounts with me about my cows, I will g'down to\nHades and shine there among the dead.'\n\"'Sun,' said Jove, 'g'on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over\nthe fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship int'little pieces with a\nbolt of white lightning as soon as they get out t'sea.'\n\"I was told all this by Calypso, wh'said she had heard it from the\nmouth of Mercury.\n\"As soon as I got down t'my ship and t'the sea shore I rebuked each\none of the men separately, but we could see n'way out of it, for the\ncows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once t'show signs\nand wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about, and\nthe joints upon the spits began t'low like cows, and the meat, whether\ncooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.",

T'you others, however, wh'come here night after\nnight t'drink my choicest wine and listen t'my bard, I would insist\nas follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought\ngold,108 and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;\nlet us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a\nlarge tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a\ngeneral rate; for private individuals cannot be expected t'bear the\nburden of such a handsome present.\"\nEvery one approved of this, and then they went home t'bed each in his\nown abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they\nhurried down t'the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.\nAlcinous went on board and saw everything s'securely stowed under the\nship's benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers.\nThen they went t'the house of Alcinous t'get dinner, and he\nsacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove wh'is the lord of all.\nThey set the steaks t'grill and made an excellent dinner, after which\nthe inspired bard, Demodocus, wh'was a favourite with every one, sang\nt'them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as\nthough t'hasten his setting, for he was longing t'be on his way. As\none wh'has been all day ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen\nkeeps thinking about his supper and is glad when night comes that he\nmay g'and get it, for it is all his legs can d't'carry him, even so\ndid Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down, and he at once said t'the\nPhaeacians, addressing himself more particularly t'King Alcinous:\n\"Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me\non my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire by giving\nme an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may\nturn t'good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace\namong friends,109 and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction\nt'your wives and children;110 may heaven vouchsafe you every good\ngrace, and may n'evil thing come among your people.\"\nThus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and\nagreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken\nreasonably. Alcinous therefore said t'his servant, \"Pontonous, mix\nsome wine and hand it round t'everybody, that we may offer a prayer to\nfather Jove, and speed our guest upon his way.\"\nPontonous mixed the wine and handed it t'every one in turn; the others\neach from his own seat made a drink-offering t'the blessed gods that\nlive in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands\nof queen Arete.\n\"Farewell, queen,\" said he, \"henceforward and for ever, till age and\ndeath, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take\nmy leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people, and\nwith king Alcinous.\"\nAs he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to\nconduct him t'his ship and t'the sea shore. Arete als'sent some\nmaidservants with him\u2014one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to\ncarry his strong box, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to\nthe water side the crew took these things and put them on board, with\nall the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen\nsheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship.\nThen he to'went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew\ntook every man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone\nt'which it had been bound.

Thus,\nthen, she cut her way through the water, carrying one wh'was as\ncunning as the gods, but wh'was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of\nall that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves\nof the weary sea.\nWhen the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began t'show,\nthe ship drew near t'land.112 Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the\nold merman Phorcys, which lies between tw'points that break the line\nof the sea and shut the harbour in.

This will\nastonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under the\nmountain.\"\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went t'Scheria where the\nPhaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid\nway, had got close in. Then he went up t'it, turned it int'stone, and\ndrove it down with the flat of his hand s'as t'root it in the ground.\nAfter this he went away.",

Then Minerva came up t'him\ndisguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a\ngood cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her\ncomely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad when he\nsaw her, and went straight up t'her.\n\"My friend,\" said he, \"you are the first person whom I have met with in\nthis country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you t'be well disposed\ntowards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your\nknees and pray t'you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell\nme truly, what land and country is this? Wh'are its inhabitants? Am I\non an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?\"\nMinerva answered, \"Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come\nfrom somewhere a long way off, not t'know what country this is. It is\na very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is\nrugged and not a good driving country, but it is by n'means a bad\nisland for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn and also\nwine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle als'and\ngoats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places\nwhere the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known\neven as far as Troy, which I understand t'be a long way off from this\nAchaean country.\"\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own\ncountry, and he began t'answer, but he did not speak the truth, and\nmade up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\n\"I heard of Ithaca,\" said he, \"when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and\nnow it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as\nmuch more behind me for my children, but am flying because I killed\nOrsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him\nbecause he wanted t'rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so\nmuch trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of\nthe weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally at Troy as\nvassal, but had set myself up as an independent ruler, s'I lay in wait\nfor him with one of my followers by the road side, and speared him as\nhe was coming int'town from the country. It was a very dark night and\nnobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but\nas soon as I had done s'I went t'a ship and besought the owners, who\nwere Phoenicians, t'take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis\nwhere the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.\nThey meant n'guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we\nsailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could d't'get\ninside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though we\nwanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were.\nI was very tired and fell asleep directly, s'they took my goods out of\nthe ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the sand.\nThen they sailed away t'Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress\nof mind.\"\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand.\nThen she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, \"He must be\nindeed a shifty lying fellow,\" said she, \"wh'could surpass you in all\nmanner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist. Dare\ndevil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can you not\ndrop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are\nin your own country again? We will say n'more, however, about this,\nfor we can both of us deceive upon occasion\u2014you are the most\naccomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for\ndiplomacy and subtlety have n'equal among the gods. Did you not know\nJove's daughter Minerva\u2014me, wh'have been ever with you, wh'kept watch\nover you in all your troubles, and wh'made the Phaeacians take so\ngreat a liking t'you? And now, again, I am come here t'talk things\nover with you, and help you t'hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians\ngive you; I want t'tell you about the troubles that await you in your\nown house; you have got t'face them, but tell n'one, neither man nor\nwoman, that you have come home again. Bear everything, and put up with\nevery man's insolence, without a word.\"\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you\nare s'constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is\na hard matter for him t'know whether it is you or not. This much,\nhowever, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind t'me as long as\nwe Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on which we\nwent on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven\ndispersed us\u2014from that day, Minerva, I saw n'more of you, and cannot\never remember your coming t'my ship t'help me in a difficulty; I had\nt'wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I\nreached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took me\nint'the town.120 And now, I beseech you in your father's name, tell me\nthe truth, for I d'not believe I am really back in Ithaca. I am in\nsome other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you\nhave been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back t'my own\ncountry?\"\n\"You are always taking something of that sort in your head,\" replied\nMinerva, \"and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you\nare s'plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning\nfrom s'long a voyage would at once have gone home t'see his wife and\nchildren, but you d'not seem t'care about asking after them or\nhearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife, who\nremains at home vainly grieving for you, and having n'peace night or\nday for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near\nyou, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back\nsafely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to\nquarrel with my uncle Neptune, wh'never forgave you for having blinded\nhis son.121 I will now, however, point out t'you the lie of the land,\nand you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the old\nmerman Phorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of\nit; [near it is the cave sacred t'the Naiads;122 here to'is the\noverarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable\nhecatomb t'the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.\"\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then\nUlysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed\nthe bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed t'the nymphs,\nsaying, \"Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never\nagain t'see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving\nsalutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if\nJove's redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to\nmanhood.\"\n\"Take heart, and d'not trouble yourself about that,\" rejoined Minerva,\n\"let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where\nthey will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.\"",

He found him sitting in front of his\nhut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be\nseen from far. He had made them spacious126 and fair t'see, with a\nfree run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his\nmaster's absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,\nwithout saying anything t'Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them\non top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of\noaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside he had\nbuilt twelve styes near one another for the sows t'lie in. There were\nfifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding sows; but the\nboars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors kept\non eating them, and the swineherd had t'send them the best he had\ncontinually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the\nherdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always\nwith them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of\nsandals127 from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding\nthe pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth t'town\nwith a boar that he had been forced t'send the suitors that they might\nsacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at\nhim, but Ulysses was cunning enough t'sit down and loose his hold of\nthe stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by\nthem in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide,\nrushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off\nby shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said t'Ulysses, \"Old\nman, the dogs were likely t'have made short work of you, and then you\nwould have got me int'trouble. The gods have given me quite enough\nworries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in\ncontinual grief on his account. I have t'attend swine for other people\nt'eat, while he, if he yet lives t'see the light of day, is starving\nin some distant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill\nof bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your\nmisfortunes.\"\nOn this the swineherd led the way int'the hut and bade him sit down.",

Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome,\nand said \"May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your\nheart's desire in return for the kind way in which you have received\nme.\"\nT'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, \"Stranger, though a still\npoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me t'insult\nhim, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what\nyou can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have\nyoung lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for\nheaven has hindered the return of him wh'would have been always good\nt'me and given me something of my own\u2014a house, a piece of land, a good\nlooking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who\nhas worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as\nthey have mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown\nold here he would have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I\nwish that Helen's whole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been\nthe death of many a good man. It was this matter that took my master to\nIlius, the land of noble steeds, t'fight the Trojans in the cause of\nking Agamemnon.\"\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went t'the styes where\nthe young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out tw'which he brought\nback with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted\nthem; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before\nUlysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over\nwith white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of\nivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him t'begin.\n\"Fall to, stranger,\" said he, \"on a dish of servant's pork. The fat\npigs have t'g't'the suitors, wh'eat them up without shame or\nscruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and\nrespect those wh'd'what is lawful and right. Even the fierce\nfreebooters wh'g'raiding on other people's land, and Jove gives them\ntheir spoil\u2014even they, when they have filled their ships and got home\nagain live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but\nsome god seems t'have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone;\nthey will not, therefore, g'back t'their own homes and make their\noffers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force,\nwithout fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they\nsacrifice not one victim nor tw'only, and they take the run of his\nwine, for he was exceedingly rich. N'other great man either in Ithaca\nor on the mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men\nput together. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of\ncattle upon the main land, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also\ntwelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers feed him\ntwelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even\nlarge flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in the\ncharge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the\nbest goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the\npigs that you see here, and I have t'keep picking out the best I have\nand sending it t'them.\"\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously\nwithout a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was\nsatisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,\nfilled it with wine, and gave it t'Ulysses, wh'was pleased, and said\nas he took it in his hands, \"My friend, wh'was this master of yours\nthat bought you and paid for you, s'rich and s'powerful as you tell\nme? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me wh'he\nwas, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods\nknow, but I may be able t'give you news of him, for I have travelled\nmuch.\"\nEumaeus answered, \"Old man, n'traveller wh'comes here with news will\nget Ulysses' wife and son t'believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in\nwant of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a\nword of truth; every one wh'finds his way t'Ithaca goes t'my\nmistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes\nmuch of them, and asks them all manner of questions, crying all the\ntime as women will when they have lost their husbands. And you too, old\nman, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty\nstory. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to\npieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones are\nlying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone,\nand a bad business it is for all his friends\u2014for me especially; go\nwhere I may I shall never find s'good a master, not even if I were to\ng'home t'my mother and father where I was bred and born. I d'not so\nmuch care, however, about my parents now, though I should dearly like\nt'see them again in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that\ngrieves me most; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is\nhere n'longer, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me\nthat wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory.\"\n\"My friend,\" replied Ulysses, \"you are very positive, and very hard of\nbelief about your master's coming home again, nevertheless I will not\nmerely say, but will swear, that he is coming. D'not give me anything\nfor my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and\ncloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take\nanything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire,\nwh'lets his poverty tempt him int'lying. I swear by king Jove, by the\nrites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses t'which I have now\ncome, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses will\nreturn in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the\nbeginning of the next he will be here t'd'vengeance on all those who\nare ill treating his wife and son.\"\nT'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, \"Old man, you will neither\nget paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink\nyour wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. D'not keep\non reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks\nabout my honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I\nonly wish he may come, as d'Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his\nson Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy to'about this same boy of his;\nhe was running up fast int'manhood, and bade fare t'be n'worse man,\nface and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has\nbeen unsettling his mind, s'he has gone off t'Pylos t'try and get\nnews of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is\ncoming home, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a\nname in Ithaca. But let us say n'more about him, and leave him t'be\ntaken, or else t'escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him\nt'protect him. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also,\nfor I want t'know, wh'you are and where you come from. Tell me of\nyour town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew\nbrought you t'Ithaca, and from what country they professed t'come\u2014for\nyou cannot have come by land.\"\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I will tell you all about it. If there were meat\nand wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing t'do\nbut t'eat and drink while the others g't'their work, I could easily\ntalk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of\nthe sorrows with which it has pleased heaven t'visit me.\n\"I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well t'd'man, wh'had many\nsons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had\npurchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax\n(whose lineage I claim, and wh'was held in the highest honour among\nthe Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons) put\nme on the same level with my brothers wh'had been born in wedlock.\nWhen, however, death took him t'the house of Hades, his sons divided\nhis estate and cast lots for their shares, but t'me they gave a\nholding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me t'marry\nint'a rich family, for I was not given t'bragging, or shirking on the\nfield of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw\nyou can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to\nspare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my\nmen t'surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death s'much\nas a thought, but was the first t'leap forward and spear all whom I\ncould overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care about farm\nwork, nor the frugal home life of those wh'would bring up children. My\ndelight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows\u2014things that most\nmen shudder t'think of; but one man likes one thing and another\nanother, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the\nAchaeans went t'Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on\nforeign service, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil\nin the first instance, and much more was allotted t'me later on.\n\"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but\nwhen Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which s'many\nperished, the people required me and Idomeneus t'lead their ships to\nTroy, and there was n'way out of it, for they insisted on our doing\nso. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked\nthe city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it\nwas that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily\nwith my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of\nmaking a descent on Egypt, s'I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it.\nI had nine ships, and the people flocked t'fill them. For six days I\nand my men made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice\nt'the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board\nand set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were\ngoing down a river. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had\nn'sickness on board, but sat where we were and let the ships g'as the\nwind and steersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river\nAegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay\nby them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts t'reconnoitre\nfrom every point of vantage.\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took t'their own devices, and\nravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their\nwives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried t'the city, and\nwhen they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the\nplain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of\narmour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would n'longer\nface the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians\nkilled many of us, and took the rest alive t'd'forced labour for\nthem. Jove, however, put it in my mind t'd'thus\u2014and I wish I had died\nthen and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for\nme\u2014I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand;\nthen I went straight up t'the king's chariot, clasped his knees and\nkissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade me get int'his chariot,\nand took me weeping t'his own home. Many made at me with their ashen\nspears and tried t'kill me in their fury, but the king protected me,\nfor he feared the wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who\npunishes those wh'd'evil.\n\"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the\nEgyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on\nfor eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who\nhad already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me\nover int'going with him t'Phoenicia, where his house and his\npossessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the\nend of that time when months and days had gone by till the same season\nhad come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a\npretence that I was t'take a carg'along with him t'that place, but\nreally that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I\nsuspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not\nhelp it.\n\"The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea\nthat lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled\ntheir destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could\nsee nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and\nthe sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts\nand the ship went round and round and was filled with fire and\nbrimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all int'the sea;\nthey were carried about in the water round the ship looking like so\nmany sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of\ngetting home again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship's\nmast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung t'it, and\ndrifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the\ndarkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on t'the Thesprotian\ncoast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably\nwithout charging me anything at all\u2014for his son found me when I was\nnearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand,\ntook me t'his father's house and gave me clothes t'wear.\n\"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had\nentertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his\nhomeward journey. He showed me als'the treasure of gold, and wrought\niron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough t'keep his family\nfor ten generations, s'much had he left in the house of king Pheidon.\nBut the king said Ulysses had gone t'Dodona that he might learn Jove's\nmind from the god's high oak tree, and know whether after s'long an\nabsence he should return t'Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the\nking swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as\nhe did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found,\nthat should take him t'his own country. He sent me off however before\nUlysses returned, for there happened t'be a Thesprotian ship sailing\nfor the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge\nof her t'be sure and take me safely t'King Acastus.\n\"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me t'the\nvery extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from\nland they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the\nshirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered\nold clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they\nreached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a\nstrong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore t'get supper by\nthe sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn\nmy rags over my head I slid down the rudder int'the sea, where I\nstruck out and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near\na thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my\nhaving escaped and went searching about for me, till at last they\nthought it was n'further use and went back t'their ship. The gods,\nhaving hidden me thus easily, then took me t'a good man's door\u2014for it\nseems that I am not t'die yet awhile.\"\nT'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, \"Poor unhappy stranger, I\nhave found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but\nthat part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to\nbelieve it. Why should a man like you g'about telling lies in this\nway? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and all of\nthem detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him\ndie with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done;\nfor then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his\nson would have been heir t'his renown, but now the storm winds have\nspirited him away we know not whither.\n\"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never g'to\nthe town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news\nabout Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those\nwh'grieve over the king's absence, and those wh'rejoice at it because\nthey can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I\nhave never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was\ntaken in by an Aetolian, wh'had killed a man and come a long way till\nat last he reached my station, and I was very kind t'him. He said he\nhad seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships\nwhich had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the\nfollowing summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back\nmuch wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has\nbrought you t'my door, d'not try t'flatter me in this way with vain\nhopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but\nonly out of respect for Jove the god of hospitality, as fearing him and\npitying you.\"\nUlysses answered, \"I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have\ngiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a\nbargain, and call all the gods in heaven t'witness it. If your master\ncomes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to\nDulichium where I want t'go; but if he does not come as I say he will,\nset your men on t'me, and tell them t'throw me from yonder precipice,\nas a warning t'tramps not t'g'about the country telling lies.\"\n\"And a pretty figure I should cut then,\" replied Eumaeus, \"both now and\nhereafter, if I were t'kill you after receiving you int'my hut and\nshowing you hospitality. I should have t'say my prayers in good\nearnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will\ncome in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.\"\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the\npigs, which were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a\ntremendous squealing they made as they were being driven int'them. But\nEumaeus called t'his men and said, \"Bring in the best pig you have,\nthat I may sacrifice him for this stranger, and we will take toll of\nhim ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs,\nwhile others reap the fruit of our labour.\"\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine\nfat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not\nforget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, s'the first\nthing he did was t'cut bristles from the pig's face and throw them\nint'the fire, praying t'all the gods as he did s'that Ulysses might\nreturn home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which\nhe had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it,\nwhile the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and\nEumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on t'some of the\nfat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers;\nthey cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits\nand roasted them till they were done; when they had taken them off the\nspits they threw them on t'the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who\nwas a most equitable man, then stood up t'give every one his share. He\nmade seven portions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of\nMaia and the nymphs, praying t'them as he did so; the others he dealt\nout t'the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways\ndown the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much\npleased. \"I hope, Eumaeus,\" said he, \"that Jove will be as well\ndisposed towards you as I am, for the respect you are showing t'an\noutcast like myself.\"\nT'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, \"Eat, my good fellow, and\nenjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,\njust as he thinks right, for he can d'whatever he chooses.\"\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt\nsacrifice t'the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put\nthe cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down t'his own portion.\nMesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man\non his own account from among the Taphians during his master's absence,\nand had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either\nt'his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good\nthings that were before them, and when they had had enough t'eat and\ndrink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all\nwent t'bed after having made a hearty supper.",

It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will\nmake even a wise man fall t'singing; it will make him chuckle and\ndance and say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as\nI have begun, I will g'on. Would that I were still young and strong as\nwhen we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the\nleaders, but I was in command also, for the other tw'would have it so.\nWhen we had come up t'the wall of the city we crouched down beneath\nour armour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood\nthat grew about the swamp. It came on t'freeze with a North wind\nblowing; the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields\nwere coated thick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts,\nand slept comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders,\nbut I had carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I\nshould be to'cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and\nshield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted\ntheir places, I nudged Ulysses wh'was close t'me with my elbow, and\nhe at once gave me his ear.\n\"'Ulysses,' said I, 'this cold will be the death of me, for I have no\ncloak; some god fooled me int'setting off with nothing on but my\nshirt, and I d'not know what t'do.'\n\"Ulysses, wh'was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following\nplan:\n\"'Keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hear you.'\nThen he raised his head on his elbow.\n\"'My friends,' said he, 'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We\nare a long way from the ships; I wish some one would g'down and tell\nAgamemnon t'send us up more men at once.'\n\"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running\nt'the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough\ntill morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in\nthose days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak\nboth out of good will and for the respect due t'a brave soldier; but\nnow people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby.\"\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Old man, you have told us an excellent story,\nand have said nothing s'far but what is quite satisfactory; for the\npresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else\nthat a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow\nmorning you have t'shake your own old rags about your body again, for\nwe have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has\nonly one. When Ulysses' son comes home again he will give you both\ncloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want t'go.\"\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some\ngoatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here\nUlysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak\nthat he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the\nswineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, s'he got ready to\ng'outside, and Ulysses was glad t'see that he looked after his\nproperty during his master's absence. First he slung his sword over his\nbrawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak t'keep out the wind. He also\ntook the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of\nattack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went t'his rest where the\npigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from\nthe North wind.",

At\nthis moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got\nup; s'Menelaus told him t'light the fire and cook some meat, which he\nat once did. Then Menelaus went down int'his fragrant store room,130\nnot alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the\nplace where the treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double\ncup, and told his son Megapenthes t'bring als'a silver mixing bowl.\nMeanwhile Helen went t'the chest where she kept the lovely dresses\nwhich she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was\nlargest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered\nlike a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. 131 Then they all\ncame back through the house again till they got t'Telemachus, and\nMenelaus said, \"Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring\nyou safely home according t'your desire. I will now present you with\nthe finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a\nmixing bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold,\nand it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made me a\npresent of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on\nmy return home. I should like t'give it t'you.\"\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,\nwhile Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before\nhim. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\n\"I too, my son,\" said she, \"have something for you as a keepsake from\nthe hand of Helen; it is for your bride t'wear upon her wedding day.\nTill then, get your dear mother t'keep it for you; thus may you go\nback rejoicing t'your own country and t'your home.\"\nS'saying she gave the robe over t'him and he received it gladly. Then\nPisistratus put the presents int'the chariot, and admired them all as\nhe did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus int'the\nhouse, and they both of them sat down t'table. A maid servant brought\nthem water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it int'a silver\nbasin for them t'wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside\nthem; an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good\nthings of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and\ngave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine.\nThen they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,\nbut as soon as they had had enough t'eat and drink Telemachus and\nPisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot.\nThey drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing\ngatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came after them with a\ngolden goblet of wine in his right hand that they might make a\ndrink-offering before they set out. He stood in front of the horses and\npledged them, saying, \"Farewell t'both of you; see that you tell\nNestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind t'me as any father\ncould be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy.\"",

But as\nTelemachus was thus busied, praying als'and sacrificing t'Minerva in\nthe ship's stern, there came t'him a man from a distant country, a\nseer, wh'was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was\ndescended from Melampus, wh'used t'live in Pylos, the land of sheep;\nhe was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven int'exile by\nthe great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held\nthem for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the\nhouse of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account of\nthe daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow\nthat dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped\nwith his life, drove the cattle from Phylace t'Pylos, avenged the\nwrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus t'his\nbrother. Then he left the country and went t'Argos, where it was\nordained that he should reign over much people. There he married,\nestablished himself, and had tw'famous sons Antiphates and Mantius.\nAntiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, wh'was\ndearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live t'old\nage, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman's gifts. His sons\nwere Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was\nfather t'Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off\nCleitus for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell among the immortals,\nbut Apoll'made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now\nthat Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to\nlive in Hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied for all men.\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was wh'now came up t'Telemachus as he was\nmaking drink-offerings and praying in his ship. \"Friend,\" said he, \"now\nthat I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your\nsacrifices themselves, and by the god t'whom you make them, I pray you\nals'by your own head and by those of your followers tell me the truth\nand nothing but the truth.

As soon as they had had t'eat and\ndrink, Ulysses began trying t'prove the swineherd and see whether he\nwould continue t'treat him kindly, and ask him t'stay on at the\nstation or pack him off t'the city; s'he said:\n\"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want t'g'away and begin begging\nabout the town, s'as t'be n'more trouble t'you or t'your men. Give\nme your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide t'g'with me\nand show me the way. I will g'the round of the city begging as I needs\nmust, t'see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I\nshould like als't'g't'the house of Ulysses and bring news of her\nhusband t'Queen Penelope. I could then g'about among the suitors and\nsee if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should\nsoon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and\nbelieve when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury wh'gives grace\nand good name t'the works of all men, there is n'one living wh'would\nmake a more handy servant than I should\u2014t'put fresh wood on the fire,\nchop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and d'all those services that\npoor men have t'd'for their betters.\"\nThe swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. \"Heaven help\nme,\" he exclaimed, \"what ever can have put such a notion as that into\nyour head? If you g'near the suitors you will be undone t'a\ncertainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They\nwould never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their\nservants are all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and\nshirts, with well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables\nare kept quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay\nwhere you are, then; you are not in anybody's way; I d'not mind your\nbeing here, n'more d'any of the others, and when Telemachus comes\nhome he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you\nwant t'go.\"\nUlysses answered, \"I hope you may be as dear t'the gods as you are to\nme, for having saved me from going about and getting int'trouble;\nthere is nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still, when men\nhave once got low down in the world they will g'through a great deal\non behalf of their miserable bellies. Since, however, you press me to\nstay here and await the return of Telemachus, tell me about Ulysses'\nmother, and his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he\nset out for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in\nthe house of Hades?\"\n\"I will tell you all about them,\" replied Eumaeus, \"Laertes is still\nliving and prays heaven t'let him depart peacefully in his own house,\nfor he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also\nabout the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him\nmore than anything else did. She came t'an unhappy end133 through\nsorrow for her son: may n'friend or neighbour wh'has dealt kindly by\nme come t'such an end as she did. As long as she was still living,\nthough she was always grieving, I used t'like seeing her and asking\nher how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene,\nthe youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and she\nmade little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they\nsent Ctimene t'Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me,\nmy mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for\nmy feet, and sent me off int'the country, but she was just as fond of\nme as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to\nprosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have enough t'eat\nand drink, and can find something for any respectable stranger who\ncomes here; but there is n'getting a kind word or deed out of my\nmistress, for the house has fallen int'the hands of wicked people.\nServants want sometimes t'see their mistress and have a talk with her;\nthey like t'have something t'eat and drink at the house, and\nsomething to't'take back with them int'the country. This is what\nwill keep servants in a good humour.\"\nUlysses answered, \"Then you must have been a very little fellow,\nEumaeus, when you were taken s'far away from your home and parents.\nTell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother\nlived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you\nwere alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for\nwhatever your master gave them?\"\n\"Stranger,\" replied Eumaeus, \"as regards your question: sit still, make\nyourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen t'me. The nights are\nnow at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and\nsitting up talking together; you ought not t'g't'bed till bed time,\nto'much sleep is as bad as to'little; if any one of the others wishes\nt'g't'bed let him leave us and d'so; he can then take my master's\npigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning.

A father could not\nbe more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old\nage, after ten years' absence in a foreign country and after having\ngone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as\nthough he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly t'him saying:\n\"S'you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I\nheard you had gone t'Pylos I made sure I was never going t'see you\nany more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good\nlook at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into\nthe country t'see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close t'the town\ngenerally. I suppose you think it better t'keep an eye on what the\nsuitors are doing.\"\n\"S'be it, old friend,\" answered Telemachus, \"but I am come now because\nI want t'see you, and t'learn whether my mother is still at her old\nhome or whether some one else has married her, s'that the bed of\nUlysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.\"\n\"She is still at the house,\" replied Eumaeus, \"grieving and breaking\nher heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually.\"\nAs he spoke he took Telemachus' spear, whereon he crossed the stone\nthreshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat t'give him place\nas he entered, but Telemachus checked him; \"Sit down, stranger,\" said\nhe, \"I can easily find another seat, and there is one here wh'will lay\nit for me.\"\nUlysses went back t'his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green\nbrushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for\nTelemachus t'sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of\ncold meat, the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he\nfilled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine\nals'in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they\nlaid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon\nas they had had enough t'eat and drink Telemachus said t'Eumaeus,\n\"Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew bring\nhim t'Ithaca, and wh'were they?\u2014for assuredly he did not come here by\nland.\"\nT'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, \"My son, I will tell you the\nreal truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great\ntraveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,\nand has taken refuge at my station, s'I will put him int'your hands.\nD'whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your\nsuppliant.\"\n\"I am very much distressed,\" said Telemachus, \"by what you have just\ntold me. How can I take this stranger int'my house? I am as yet young,\nand am not strong enough t'hold my own if any man attacks me. My\nmother cannot make up her mind whether t'stay where she is and look\nafter the house out of respect for public opinion and the memory of her\nhusband, or whether the time is now come for her t'take the best man\nof those wh'are wooing her, and the one wh'will make her the most\nadvantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come t'your station I\nwill find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals,\nand will send him wherever he wants t'go. Or if you like you can keep\nhim here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food that he\nmay be n'burden on you and on your men; but I will not have him go\nnear the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure t'ill treat\nhim in a way that would greatly grieve me; n'matter how valiant a man\nmay be he can d'nothing against numbers, for they will be to'strong\nfor him.\"\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, it is right that I should say something\nmyself. I am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent\nway in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you\nare. Tell me, d'you submit t'such treatment tamely, or has some god\nset your people against you? May you not complain of your brothers\u2014for\nit is t'these that a man may look for support, however great his\nquarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my present\nmind; if I were son t'Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would\nrather some one came and cut my head off, but I would g't'the house\nand be the bane of every one of these men.139 If they were to'many for\nme\u2014I being single-handed\u2014I would rather die fighting in my own house\nthan see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly\nmaltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an\nunseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all t'n'purpose\nfor an end that shall never be accomplished.\"\nAnd Telemachus answered, \"I will tell you truly everything. There is no\nenmity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to\nwhom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove\nhas made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius,\nand Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses\nwh'left me behind him when he went away, s'that I have never been of\nany use t'him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of\nnumberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands,\nDulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as als'all the principal men of Ithaca\nitself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying court t'my\nmother, wh'will neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor\nyet bring matters t'an end, s'they are making havoc of my estate, and\nbefore long will d's'with myself int'the bargain. The issue,\nhowever, rests with heaven. But d'you, old friend Eumaeus, g'at once\nand tell Penelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell it\nt'herself alone, and then come back here without letting any one else\nknow, for there are many wh'are plotting mischief against me.\"\n\"I understand and heed you,\" replied Eumaeus; \"you need instruct me no\nfurther, only as I am going that way say whether I had not better let\npoor Laertes know that you are returned. He used t'superintend the\nwork on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he\nwould eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me\nthat from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten\nnor drunk as he ought t'do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits\nweeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.\"\n\"More's the pity,\" answered Telemachus, \"I am sorry for him, but we\nmust leave him t'himself just now. If people could have everything\ntheir own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return of\nmy father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back again,\nand d'not turn out of your way t'tell Laertes. Tell my mother t'send\none of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it\nfrom her.\"\nThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,\nbound them t'his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched him\nwell off the station, and then came up t'it in the form of a\nwoman\u2014fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the entry,\nand revealed herself t'Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see her, and\nknew not that she was there, for the gods d'not let themselves be seen\nby everybody. Ulysses saw her, and s'did the dogs, for they did not\nbark, but went scared and whining off t'the other side of the yards.\nShe nodded her head and motioned t'Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon\nhe left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the\nyards. Then she said t'him:\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you t'tell your\nson: d'not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the\ndestruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be\nlong in joining you, for I to'am eager for the fray.\"\nAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a\nfair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him\nyounger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,\nfilled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she\nwent away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded",

You are dressed differently and your colour is not\nthe same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If\nso, be propitious t'me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings\nof wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.\"\nAnd Ulysses said, \"I am n'god, why should you take me for one? I am\nyour father, on whose account you grieve and suffer s'much at the\nhands of lawless men.\"\nAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on t'the\nground, for he had restrained all tears till now. But Telemachus could\nnot yet believe that it was his father, and said:\n\"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes\nthat I may grieve the more hereafter; n'mortal man could of himself\ncontrive t'd'as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young\nat a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. A second ag'you were\nold and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from\nheaven.\"\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus, you ought not t'be s'immeasurably\nastonished at my being really here. There is n'other Ulysses wh'will\ncome hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, wh'after long wandering and\nmuch hardship have got home in the twentieth year t'my own country.\nWhat you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who\ndoes with me whatever she will, for she can d'what she pleases. At one\nmoment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with\ngood clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods wh'live in\nheaven t'make any man look either rich or poor.\"\nAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father\nand wept. They were both s'much moved that they cried aloud like\neagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their\nhalf fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the\nsun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had not\nsuddenly said, \"In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you\nt'Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves t'be\u2014for you\ncannot have come by land?\"\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" replied Ulysses. \"It was the\nPhaeacians wh'brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the\nhabit of giving escorts t'any one wh'reaches their coasts. They took\nme over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after\ngiving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by\nheaven's mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on\nthe suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing our\nenemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with their\nnumber, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can then turn\nthe matter over in my mind, and see whether we tw'can fight the whole\nbody of them ourselves, or whether we must find others t'help us.\"\nT'this Telemachus answered, \"Father, I have always heard of your\nrenown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a\nvery great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; tw'men cannot\nstand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor\ntwice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at\nonce. There are fifty-tw'chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have\nsix servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans\nfrom Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born.\nThey have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and tw'men wh'can carve\nat table. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to\nrue your coming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some\none wh'would be willing t'come and help us.\"\n\"Listen t'me,\" replied Ulysses, \"and think whether Minerva and her\nfather Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am t'try and find some\none else as well.\"\n\"Those whom you have named,\" answered Telemachus, \"are a couple of good\nallies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power\nover both gods and men.\"\n\"These two,\" continued Ulysses, \"will not keep long out of the fray,\nwhen the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return\nhome early to-morrow morning, and g'about among the suitors as before.\nLater on the swineherd will bring me t'the city disguised as a\nmiserable old beggar. If you see them ill treating me, steel your heart\nagainst my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of\nthe house, or throw things at me, look on and d'nothing beyond gently\ntrying t'make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to\nyou, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and\nlay my saying t'your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I\nwill nod my head t'you, and on seeing me d'this you must collect all\nthe armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room.\nMake some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say\nthat you have taken it t'be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as\nit is n'longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become\nsoiled and begrimed with soot. Add t'this more particularly that you\nare afraid Jove may set them on t'quarrel over their wine, and that\nthey may d'each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and\nwooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people t'use them. But\nleave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of\noxhide shields s'that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and\nMinerva will then soon quiet these people. There is als'another\nmatter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let\nn'one know that Ulysses is within the house\u2014neither Laertes, nor yet\nthe swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let\nyou and me exploit the women alone, and let us als'make trial of some\nother of the men servants, t'see wh'is on our side and whose hand is\nagainst us.\"\n\"Father,\" replied Telemachus, \"you will come t'know me by and by, and\nwhen you d'you will find that I can keep your counsel. I d'not think,\nhowever, the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us.\nThink it over. It will take us a long time t'g'the round of the farms\nand exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting your\nestate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all\nmeans, t'see wh'are disloyal and wh'guiltless, but I am not in\nfavour of going round and trying the men. We can attend t'that later\non, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will support you.\"\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought\nTelemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When\nthey had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on t'the land;\ntheir servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all\nthe presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant t'tell\nPenelope that Telemachus had gone int'the country, but had sent the\nship t'the town t'prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.\nThis servant and Eumaeus happened t'meet when they were both on the\nsame errand of going t'tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the\nservant stood up and said t'the queen in the presence of the waiting\nwomen, \"Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos\"; but Eumaeus went\nclose up t'Penelope, and said privately all that her son had bidden\nhim tell her.

Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the\nfirst t'speak.\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"this voyage of Telemachus's is a very serious\nmatter; we had made sure that it would come t'nothing. Now, however,\nlet us draw a ship int'the water, and get a crew together t'send\nafter the others and tell them t'come back as fast as they can.\"\nHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and saw\nthe ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails, and\nputting by their oars; s'he laughed, and said t'the others, \"We need\nnot send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told\nthem, or else they saw the ship g'by, and could not overtake her.\"\nOn this they rose and went t'the water side. The crew then drew the\nship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they\nwent up in a body t'the place of assembly, but they would not let any\none old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes,\nspoke first.\n\"Good heavens,\" said he, \"see how the gods have saved this man from\ndestruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day\nlong, and when the sun was down we never went on shore t'sleep, but\nwaited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and\nkilling him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let us\nconsider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our\naffair is never likely t'come off while he is alive, for he is very\nshrewd, and public feeling is by n'means all on our side. We must make\nhaste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose n'time\nin doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will tell all the\nworld how we plotted t'kill him, but failed t'take him. The people\nwill not like this when they come t'know of it; we must see that they\nd'us n'hurt, nor drive us from our own country int'exile. Let us try\nand lay hold of him either on his farm away from the town, or on the\nroad hither. Then we can divide up his property amongst us, and let his\nmother and the man wh'marries her have the house. If this does not\nplease you, and you wish Telemachus t'live on and hold his father's\nproperty, then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this\nway, but must make our offers t'Penelope each from his own house, and\nshe can marry the man wh'will give the most for her, and whose lot it\nis t'win her.\"\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose t'speak. He was the\nson of Nisus, wh'was son t'king Aretias, and he was foremost among\nall the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of\nDulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable t'Penelope\nthan that of any of the other suitors, for he was a man of good natural\ndisposition. \"My friends,\" said he, speaking t'them plainly and in all\nhonestly, \"I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous\nthing t'kill one wh'is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of\nthe gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to\nkill him myself, and will urge everyone else t'd'so; but if they\ndissuade us, I would have you hold your hands.\"\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, s'they rose\nforthwith and went t'the house of Ulysses, where they took their\naccustomed seats.\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself t'the suitors. She\nknew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had\noverheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to\nthe court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she\nstood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister\nholding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:\n\"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best\nspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are\nnothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try t'compass the death of\nTelemachus, and take n'heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove\nhimself? It is not right for you t'plot thus against one another. Do\nyou not remember how your father fled t'this house in fear of the\npeople, wh'were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian\npirates and plundered the Thesprotians wh'were at peace with us? They\nwanted t'tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses\nstayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour\nhis property without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his\nwife and trying t'kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the\nothers also.\"\nT'this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, \"Take heart, Queen Penelope\ndaughter of Icarius, and d'not trouble yourself about these matters.\nThe man is not yet born, nor never will be, wh'shall lay hands upon\nyour son Telemachus, while I yet live t'look upon the face of the\nearth. I say\u2014and it shall surely be\u2014that my spear shall be reddened\nwith his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees, held\nwine up t'my lips t'drink, and put pieces of meat int'my hands.\nTherefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing\nt'fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes t'him\nfrom the gods, he cannot escape it.\" He said this t'quiet her, but in\nreality he was plotting against Telemachus.",

The lion, when he\ncomes back t'his lair, will make short work with the pair of them, and\ns'will Ulysses with these suitors.

As regards your\nquestion, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the\nold man of the sea told me, s'much will I tell you in full. He said he\ncould see Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the\nnymph Calypso, wh'was keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his\nhome, for he had n'ships nor sailors t'take him over the sea.' This\nwas what Menelaus told me, and when I had heard his story I came away;\nthe gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.\"\nWith these words he moved the heart of Penelope.

But a man cannot\nhide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives\nmuch trouble t'all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted\nout t'sail the seas, and t'make war upon other people.\"\nAs they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his\nhead and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred\nbefore setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him.\nIn the old days he used t'be taken out by the young men when they went\nhunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone\nhe was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in\nfront of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to\nmanure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw\nUlysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he\ncould not get close up t'his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the\nother side of the yard, he dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus\nseeing it, and said:\n\"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:\nhis build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he\nonly one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept\nmerely for show?\"\n\"This hound,\" answered Eumaeus, \"belonged t'him wh'has died in a far\ncountry. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would\nsoon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the\nforest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But\nnow he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and\nthe women take n'care of him. Servants never d'their work when their\nmaster's hand is n'longer over them, for Jove takes half the goodness\nout of a man when he makes a slave of him.\"\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings t'the cloister where the\nsuitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master.\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him\nt'come and sit beside him; s'he looked about and saw a seat lying\nnear where the carver sat serving out their portions t'the suitors; he\npicked it up, brought it t'Telemachus's table, and sat down opposite\nhim. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave him bread from\nthe bread-basket.\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor\nmiserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in\nrags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors\nleading from the outer t'the inner court, and against a bearing-post\nof cypress-wood which the carpenter had skilfully planed, and had made\nt'join truly with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the\nbread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in his tw'hands, and\nsaid t'Eumaeus, \"Take this t'the stranger, and tell him t'g'the\nround of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be\nshamefaced.\"\nS'Eumaeus went up t'him and said, \"Stranger, Telemachus sends you\nthis, and says you are t'g'the round of the suitors begging, for\nbeggars must not be shamefaced.\"\nUlysses answered, \"May King Jove grant all happiness t'Telemachus, and\nfulfil the desire of his heart.\"\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it\non the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the\nbard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left off. The\nsuitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up t'Ulysses and\nprompted him t'beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors, that\nhe might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the\nbad; but come what might she was not going t'save a single one of\nthem. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left t'right,\nand stretched out his hands t'beg as though he were a real beggar.",

The swineherd brought him here, but I\nknow nothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from.\"\nOn this Antinous began t'abuse the swineherd. \"You precious idiot,\" he\ncried, \"what have you brought this man t'town for? Have we not tramps\nand beggars enough already t'pester us as we sit at meat? D'you think\nit a small thing that such people gather here t'waste your master's\nproperty\u2014and must you needs bring this man as well?\"\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Antinous, your birth is good but your words\nevil. It was n'doing of mine that he came here. Wh'is likely to\ninvite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who\ncan d'public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a\nbard wh'can charm us with his singing? Such men are welcome all the\nworld over, but n'one is likely t'ask a beggar wh'will only worry\nhim. You are always harder on Ulysses' servants than any of the other\nsuitors are, and above all on me, but I d'not care s'long as\nTelemachus and Penelope are alive and here.\"\nBut Telemachus said, \"Hush, d'not answer him; Antinous has the\nbitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.\"\nThen turning t'Antinous he said, \"Antinous, you take as much care of\nmy interests as though I were your son. Why should you want t'see this\nstranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and\ngive it him yourself; I d'not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind\nmy mother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you\nwill not d'what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself\nthan of giving them t'other people.\"\n\"What d'you mean, Telemachus,\" replied Antinous, \"by this swaggering\ntalk? If all the suitors were t'give him as much as I will, he would\nnot come here again for another three months.\"\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from\nunder the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but\nthe other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with\nbread and meat; he was about, therefore, t'g'back t'the threshold\nand eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to\nAntinous and said:\n\"Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you\nseem t'be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be\nthe better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too\nwas a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I\ngave t'many a tramp such as I now am, n'matter wh'he might be nor\nwhat he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things\nwhich people have wh'live well and are accounted wealthy, but it\npleased Jove t'take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving\nrobbers t'Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I\nstationed my ships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them\nand keep guard over them, while I sent out scouts t'reconnoitre from\nevery point of vantage.\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took t'their own devices, and\nravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their\nwives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried t'the city,\nand when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till\nthe plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam\nof armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no\nlonger face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The\nEgyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive t'd'forced\nlabour for them; as for myself, they gave me t'a friend wh'met them,\nt'take t'Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, wh'was a great man in\nCyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.\"\nThen Antinous said, \"What god can have sent such a pestilence t'plague\nus during our dinner? Get out, int'the open part of the court,145 or I\nwill give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and\nimportunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given you\nlavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy t'be free\nwith other people's property when there is plenty of it.\"\nOn this Ulysses began t'move off, and said, \"Your looks, my fine sir,\nare better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would\nnot spare a poor man s'much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in\nanother man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you\nt'give him even a piece of bread.\"\nThis made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, \"You shall\npay for this before you get clear of the court.\" With these words he\nthrew a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder blade near\nthe top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not\neven stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his\nrevenge. Then he went back t'the threshold and sat down there, laying\nhis well filled wallet at his feet.\n\"Listen t'me,\" he cried, \"you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may\nspeak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he gets\nhit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle; and\neven s'Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly,\nwhich is always getting people int'trouble. Still, if the poor have\ngods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may come to\na bad end before his marriage.\"\n\"Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off\nelsewhere,\" shouted Antinous. \"If you say more I will have you dragged\nhand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you\nalive.\"\nThe other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young\nmen said, \"Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a\ntramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out t'be some\ngod\u2014and we know the gods g'about disguised in all sorts of ways as\npeople from foreign countries, and travel about the world t'see wh'do\namiss and wh'righteously.\"146\nThus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them n'heed. Meanwhile\nTelemachus was furious about the blow that had been given t'his\nfather, and though n'tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence\nand brooded on his revenge.\nNow when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the\nbanqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, \"Would that Apollo\nwould s'strike you, Antinous,\" and her waiting woman Eurynome\nanswered, \"If our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would\never again see the sun rise.\" Then Penelope said, \"Nurse,147 I hate\nevery single one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I\nhate Antinous like the darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate\ntramp has come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else\nhas given him something t'put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him\non the right shoulder-blade with a footstool.\"\nThus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in the\nmeantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the\nswineherd and said, \"Eumaeus, g'and tell the stranger t'come here, I\nwant t'see him and ask him some questions. He seems t'have travelled\nmuch, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.\"\nT'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, \"If these Achaeans, Madam,\nwould only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his\nadventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,\nwhich was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,\nand he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had\nbeen the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips\nall hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I sat\nin my hut and listened t'him. He says there is an old friendship\nbetween his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete\nwhere the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither\nand thither by every kind of misfortune; he als'declares that he has\nheard of Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the\nThesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth home with him.\"\n\"Call him here, then,\" said Penelope, \"that I to'may hear his story.\nAs for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they\nwill, for they have nothing t'fret about. Their corn and wine remain\nunwasted in their houses with none but servants t'consume them, while\nthey keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen,\nsheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving s'much as a\nthought t'the quantity of wine they drink. N'estate can stand such\nrecklessness, for we have now n'Ulysses t'protect us. If he were to\ncome again, he and his son would soon have their revenge.\"\nAs she spoke Telemachus sneezed s'loudly that the whole house\nresounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to\nEumaeus, \"G'and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed\njust as I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are\ngoing t'be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore\nI say, and lay my saying t'your heart: if I am satisfied that the\nstranger is speaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of\ngood wear.\"",

As for bread, you can get enough of that\nt'fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting those give\nthat will.\"\n\"I will tell Penelope,\" answered Ulysses, \"nothing but what is strictly\ntrue. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him in\naffliction, but I am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel\nsuitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now,\nmoreover, as I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man\ngave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any\none else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, t'be patient and wait\ntill sundown. Let her give me a seat close up t'the fire, for my\nclothes are worn very thin\u2014you know they are, for you have seen them\never since I first asked you t'help me\u2014she can then ask me about the\nreturn of her husband.\"\nThe swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she\nsaw him cross the threshold, \"Why d'you not bring him here, Eumaeus?\nIs he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming\ninside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.\"\nT'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, \"The stranger is quite\nreasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one\nelse would do. He asks you t'wait till sundown, and it will be much\nbetter, madam, that you should have him all t'yourself, when you can\nhear him and talk t'him as you will.\"\n\"The man is n'fool,\" answered Penelope, \"it would very likely be as he\nsays, for there are n'such abominable people in the whole world as\nthese men are.\"\nWhen she had done speaking Eumaeus went back t'the suitors, for he had\nexplained everything. Then he went up t'Telemachus and said in his ear\ns'that none could overhear him, \"My dear sir, I will now g'back to\nthe pigs, t'see after your property and my own business. You will look\nt'what is going on here, but above all be careful t'keep out of\ndanger, for there are many wh'bear you ill will.

Leave the rest t'heaven and me.\"\nOn this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his\ndinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table, and\nwent back t'his pigs.

This man had n'strength nor stay in him, but he was a great\nhulking fellow t'look at; his real name, the one his mother gave him,\nwas Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called him Irus,148 because\nhe used t'run errands for any one wh'would send him. As soon as he\ncame he began t'insult Ulysses, and t'try and drive him out of his\nown house.\n\"Be off, old man,\" he cried, \"from the doorway, or you shall be dragged\nout neck and heels. D'you not see that they are all giving me the\nwink, and wanting me t'turn you out by force, only I d'not like t'do\nso? Get up then, and g'of yourself, or we shall come t'blows.\"\nUlysses frowned on him and said, \"My friend, I d'you n'manner of\nharm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room\nenough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me\nthings that are not yours t'give. You seem t'be just such another\ntramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and\nby. D'not, however, talk to'much about fighting or you will incense\nme, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood.\nI shall have more peace tomorrow if I do, for you will not come t'the\nhouse of Ulysses any more.\"\nIrus was very angry and answered, \"You filthy glutton, you run on\ntrippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind t'lay both hands\nabout you, and knock your teeth out of your head like s'many boar's\ntusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and\nlook on. You will never be able t'fight one wh'is s'much younger\nthan yourself.\"\nThus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front\nof the doorway,149 and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed\nheartily and said t'the others, \"This is the finest sport that you\never saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it int'this house. The\nstranger and Irus have quarreled and are going t'fight, let us set\nthem on t'd's'at once.\"\nThe suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the tw'ragged\ntramps. \"Listen t'me,\" said Antinous, \"there are some goats' paunches\ndown at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set\naside for supper; he wh'is victorious and proves himself t'be the\nbetter man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our\ntable and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all.\"\nThe others all agreed, but Ulysses, t'throw them off the scent, said,\n\"Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his\nown against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though\nI know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear,\nhowever that none of you will give me a foul blow t'favour Irus and\nsecure him the victory.\"\nThey swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath\nTelemachus put in a word and said, \"Stranger, if you have a mind to\nsettle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here.\nWhoever strikes you will have t'fight more than one. I am host, and\nthe other chiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of\nunderstanding, are of the same mind as I am.\"\nEvery one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,\nthus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his\nmighty arms; but Minerva came up t'him and made his limbs even\nstronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one\nwould turn towards his neighbour saying, \"The stranger has brought such\na thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of\nIrus.\"\nIrus began t'be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded\nhim by force, and brought him [int'the open part of the court] in such\na fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded him and\nsaid, \"You swaggering bully, you ought never t'have been born at all\nif you are afraid of such an old broken down creature as this tramp is.\nI say, therefore\u2014and it shall surely be\u2014if he beats you and proves\nhimself the better man, I shall pack you off on board ship t'the\nmainland and send you t'king Echetus, wh'kills every one that comes\nnear him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your\nentrails for the dogs t'eat.\"\nThis frightened Irus still more, but they brought him int'the middle\nof the court, and the tw'men raised their hands t'fight. Then Ulysses\nconsidered whether he should let drive s'hard at him as t'make an end\nof him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter blow\nthat should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best t'give\nthe lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin t'suspect wh'he\nwas. Then they began t'fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the right\nshoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the ear that\nbroke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came gushing out of his\nmouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking on\nthe ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of\nlaughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by the foot and dragged him\nint'the outer court as far as the gate-house. There he propped him up\nagainst the wall and put his staff in his hands. \"Sit here,\" said he,\n\"and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful creature, and if you\ntry t'make yourself king of the beggars any more you shall fare still\nworse.\"\nThen he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn over his\nshoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back t'sit down upon\nthe threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and",

First one and then\nanother of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind,\nand I have n'one t'stand by me. After all, however, this fight\nbetween Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it\nt'do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,\nMinerva, and Apoll'would break the neck of every one of these wooers\nof yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might all\nbe as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See\nhow he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing\nthat he cannot stand on his feet nor get back t'his home, wherever\nthat may be, for he has n'strength left in him.\"\nThus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, \"Queen\nPenelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos\ncould see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your\nhouse by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the\nwhole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of\nunderstanding.\"\nT'this Penelope replied, \"Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my\nbeauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and\nmy dear husband with them. If he were t'return and look after my\naffairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presence to\nthe world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\nwhich heaven has seen fit t'heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all,\nand when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand\u2014'Wife,'\nhe said, 'we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the\nTrojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent als'at\nfighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner\nthan this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to\nyou, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do\nyou look after things here. Take care of my father and mother as at\npresent, and even more s'during my absence, but when you see our son\ngrowing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave this your present\nhome.' This is what he said and now it is all coming true. A night will\ncome when I shall have t'yield myself t'a marriage which I detest,\nfor Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief,\nmoreover, cuts me t'the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me\nafter the custom of my country. When men are courting a woman wh'they\nthink will be a good wife t'them and wh'is of noble birth, and when\nthey are each trying t'win her for himself, they usually bring oxen\nand sheep t'feast the friends of the lady, and they make her\nmagnificent presents, instead of eating up other people's property\nwithout paying for it.\"\nThis was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying\nt'get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair words\nwhich he knew she did not mean.\nThen Antinous said, \"Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many\npresents as you please from any one wh'will give them t'you; it is\nnot well t'refuse a present; but we will not g'about our business nor\nstir from where we are, till you have married the best man among us\nwhoever he may be.\"\nThe others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his\nservant t'bring his present. Antinous's man returned with a large and\nlovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully\nmade brooch pins of pure gold with which t'fasten it. Eurymachus\nimmediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads\nthat gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas's tw'men returned with some\nearrings fashioned int'three brilliant pendants which glistened most\nbeautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace of\nthe rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful\npresent of some kind.\nThen the queen went back t'her room upstairs, and her maids brought\nthe presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took t'singing and\ndancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it\ngrew dark; they then brought in three braziers151 t'give light, and\npiled them up with chopped firewood very old and dry, and they lit\ntorches from them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then\nUlysses said:\n\"Maids, servants of Ulysses wh'has s'long been absent, g't'the\nqueen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick\nwool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till\nmorning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.\"\nThe maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho\nbegan t'gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter t'Dolius, but\nhad been brought up by Penelope, wh'used t'give her toys t'play\nwith, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all\nthis she showed n'consideration for the sorrows of her mistress, and\nused t'misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in love.\n\"Poor wretch,\" said she, \"are you gone clean out of your mind? G'and\nsleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering\nhere. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters\u2014so\nmany of them too? Has the wine been getting int'your head, or d'you\nalways babble in this way? You seem t'have lost your wits because you\nbeat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than he does not come\nand cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the\nhouse.\"\n\"Vixen,\" replied Ulysses, scowling at her, \"I will g'and tell\nTelemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb\nfrom limb.\"\nWith these words he scared the women, and they went off int'the body\nof the house. They trembled all over, for they thought he would d'as\nhe said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers, holding\nup torches and looking at the people\u2014brooding the while on things that\nshould surely come t'pass.\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their\ninsolence, for she wanted Ulysses t'become even more bitter against\nthem; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on t'gibe at him,\nwhich made the others laugh. \"Listen t'me,\" said he, \"you suitors of\nQueen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for\nnothing that this man has come t'the house of Ulysses; I believe the\nlight has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head\u2014for\nhis hair is all gone, every bit of it.\"\nThen turning t'Ulysses he said, \"Stranger, will you work as a servant,\nif I send you t'the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you\nbuild a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year\nround, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not\nyou; for you have got int'bad ways, and d'not want t'work; you had\nrather fill your belly by going round the country begging.\"\n\"Eurymachus,\" answered Ulysses, \"if you and I were t'work one against\nthe other in early summer when the days are at their longest\u2014give me a\ngood scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will last\nthe longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing\ngrass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us each take a\nyoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and endurance:\nturn me int'a four acre field, and see whether you or I can drive the\nstraighter furrow. If, again, war were t'break out this day, give me a\nshield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my\ntemples\u2014you would find me foremost in the fray, and would cease your\ngibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel, and think yourself a\ngreat man because you live in a little world, and that a bad one. If\nUlysses comes t'his own again, the doors of his house are wide, but\nyou will find them narrow when you try t'fly through them.\"\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, \"You\nwretch, I will soon pay you out for daring t'say such things t'me,\nand in public too. Has the wine been getting int'your head or d'you\nalways babble in this way? You seem t'have lost your wits because you\nbeat the tramp Irus.\" With this he caught hold of a footstool, but\nUlysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, for\nhe was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and\nknocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and his\nwine-jug fell ringing t'the ground. The suitors in the covered\ncloister were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his\nneighbour, saying, \"I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad\nluck t'him, for all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such\ndisturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are t'prevail we\nshall have n'more pleasure at our banquet.\"\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, \"Sirs, are you mad? Can you\nnot carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has\npossessed you. I d'not wish t'drive any of you away, but you have had\nyour suppers, and the sooner you all g'home t'bed the better.\"\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\nbut Amphinomus the son of Nisus, wh'was son t'Aretias, said, \"D'not\nlet us take offence; it is reasonable, s'let us make n'answer.\nNeither let us d'violence t'the stranger nor t'any of Ulysses'\nservants. Let the cupbearer g'round with the drink-offerings, that we\nmay make them and g'home t'our rest. As for the stranger, let us\nleave Telemachus t'deal with him, for it is t'his house that he has\ncome.\"\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, s'Mulius of\nDulichium, servant t'Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water\nand handed it round t'each of them man by man, whereon they made their",

Say that you have taken it t'be out of the way of the\nsmoke, inasmuch as it is n'longer what it was when Ulysses went away,\nbut has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add t'this more\nparticularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on t'quarrel over\ntheir wine, and that they may d'each other some harm which may\ndisgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes\ntempts people t'use them.\"\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, s'he called nurse\nEuryclea and said, \"Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I\ntake the armour that my father left behind him down int'the store\nroom. N'one looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got all\nsmirched with soot during my own boyhood.

Surely there is some god here wh'has come down from\nheaven.\"\n\"Hush,\" answered Ulysses, \"hold your peace and ask n'questions, for\nthis is the manner of the gods. Get you t'your bed, and leave me here\nt'talk with your mother and the maids.

Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself;\nyou are like some blameless king, wh'upholds righteousness, as the\nmonarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and\nbarley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs,\nand the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people\nd'good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask\nme some other question and d'not seek t'know my race and family, or\nyou will recall memories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am\nfull of heaviness, but I ought not t'sit weeping and wailing in\nanother person's house, nor is it well t'be thus grieving continually.\nI shall have one of the servants or even yourself complaining of me,\nand saying that my eyes swim with tears because I am heavy with wine.\"\nThen Penelope answered, \"Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,\nwhether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my\ndear husband with them. If he were t'return and look after my affairs\nI should be both more respected and should show a better presence to\nthe world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\nwhich heaven has seen fit t'heap upon me. The chiefs from all our\nislands\u2014Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as als'from Ithaca itself, are\nwooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore\nshow n'attention t'strangers, nor suppliants, nor t'people wh'say\nthat they are skilled artisans, but am all the time broken-hearted\nabout Ulysses. They want me t'marry again at once, and I have to\ninvent stratagems in order t'deceive them. In the first place heaven\nput it in my mind t'set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to\nbegin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to\nthem, 'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, d'not press me to\nmarry again immediately; wait\u2014for I would not have my skill in\nneedlework perish unrecorded\u2014till I have finished making a pall for the\nher'Laertes, t'be ready against the time when death shall take him.\nHe is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out\nwithout a pall.' This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I\nused t'keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would\nunpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for\nthree years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was\nnow in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been\naccomplished, those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to\nthe suitors, wh'broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry\nwith me, s'I was forced t'finish my work whether I would or no. And\nnow I d'not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of\nthis marriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my\nson chafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for\nhe is now old enough t'understand all about it and is perfectly able\nt'look after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an\nexcellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me wh'you\nare and where you come from\u2014for you must have had father and mother of\nsome sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.\"",

Nevertheless, as\nregards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and\nfruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and\nthere are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different\nlanguages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave\nEteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a\ngreat town there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned wh'every nine years had\na conference with Jove himself.152 Minos was father t'Deucalion, whose\nson I am, for Deucalion had tw'sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus\nsailed for Troy, and I, wh'am the younger, am called Aethon; my\nbrother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the\ntwo; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him\nhospitality, for the winds took him there as he was on his way t'Troy,\ncarrying him out of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in\nAmnisus off the cave of Ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to\nenter and he could hardly find shelter from the winds that were then\nraging. As soon as he got there he went int'the town and asked for\nIdomeneus, claiming t'be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had\nalready set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, s'I took\nhim t'my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had\nabundance of everything. Moreover, I fed the men wh'were with him with\nbarley meal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and\noxen for them t'sacrifice t'their heart's content. They stayed with\nme twelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the North s'strong\nthat one could hardly keep one's feet on land. I suppose some\nunfriendly god had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the\nwind dropped, and they got away.\"\nMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept\nas she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the\nmountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed\nupon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so\ndid her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband wh'was all the time\nsitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was sorry for her, but he\nkept his eyes as hard as horn or iron without letting them s'much as\nquiver, s'cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had\nrelieved herself by weeping, she turned t'him again and said: \"Now,\nstranger, I shall put you t'the test and see whether or n'you really\ndid entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me,\nthen, how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was t'look at, and so\nals'with his companions.\"\n\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"it is such a long time ag'that I can\nhardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and\nwent elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect.\nUlysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened\nby a gold brooch with tw'catches for the pin. On the face of this\nthere was a device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his\nfore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one",

Furthermore I say, and lay my saying t'your heart, that\nI d'not know whether Ulysses wore these clothes when he left home, or\nwhether one of his companions had given them t'him while he was on his\nvoyage; or possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a\npresent of them, for he was a man of many friends and had few equals\namong the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful\npurple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down t'his feet,\nand I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a\nservant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what\nhe was like; his shoulders were hunched,154 he was dark, and he had\nthick curly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with\ngreater familiarity than he did any of the others, as being the most\nlike-minded with himself.\"\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable\nproofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found\nrelief in tears she said t'him, \"Stranger, I was already disposed to\npity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my\nhouse. It was I wh'gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them\nout of the store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also\nthe gold brooch t'wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him\nhome again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that\ndetested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even t'mention.\"\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, d'not disfigure\nyourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can\nhardly blame you for doing so. A woman wh'has loved her husband and\nborne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even\nthough he were a worse man than Ulysses, wh'they say was like a god.\nStill, cease your tears and listen t'what I can tell you. I will hide\nnothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately\nheard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the\nThesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has\nbegged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were\nlost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the\nsun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the\nsun-god's cattle, and they were all drowned t'a man. But Ulysses stuck\nt'the keel of the ship and was drifted on t'the land of the\nPhaeacians, wh'are near of kin t'the immortals, and wh'treated him\nas though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to\nescort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here\nlong ago, had he not thought better t'g'from land t'land gathering\nwealth; for there is n'man living wh'is s'wily as he is; there is no\none can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all\nthis, and he swore t'me\u2014making drink-offerings in his house as he did\nso\u2014that the ship was by the water side and the crew found wh'would\ntake Ulysses t'his own country. He sent me off first, for there\nhappened t'be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island\nof Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got\ntogether, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon t'keep\nhis family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to\nDodona that he might learn Jove's mind from the high oak tree, and know\nwhether after s'long an absence he should return t'Ithaca openly or\nin secret. S'you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is\nclose at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer;\nnevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove wh'is\nthe first and mightiest of all gods t'witness, as als'that hearth of\nUlysses t'which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely\ncome t'pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end\nof this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.\"\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true you\nshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all wh'see you\nshall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses\nwill not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for s'surely\nas that Ulysses ever was, there are now n'longer any such masters in\nthe house as he was, t'receive honourable strangers or t'further them\non their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make\nhim a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and\nquiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again,\nthat he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It\nshall be the worse for any one of these hateful people wh'is uncivil\nt'him; like it or not, he shall have n'more t'd'in this house. For\nhow, sir, shall you be able t'learn whether or n'I am superior to\nothers of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let\nyou dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for a\nlittle season; if they are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them ill\ns'long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously of them when they\nare dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously, the people\ntell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call him blessed.\"\nUlysses answered, \"Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the\nday that I left the snowy ranges of Crete t'g'on shipboard. I will\nlie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after\nnight have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for\nmorning. Nor, again, d'I like having my feet washed; I shall not let\nany of the young hussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you\nhave any old and respectable woman wh'has gone through as much trouble\nas I have, I will allow her t'wash them.\"\nT'this Penelope said, \"My dear sir, of all the guests wh'ever yet\ncame t'my house there never was one wh'spoke in all things with such\nadmirable propriety as you do. There happens t'be in the house a most\nrespectable old woman\u2014the same wh'received my poor dear husband in her\narms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She is very\nfeeble now, but she shall wash your feet.\" \"Come here,\" said she,\n\"Euryclea, and wash your master's age-mate; I suppose Ulysses' hands\nand feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of\nus dreadfully fast.\"\nOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began\nt'weep and made lamentation saying, \"My dear child, I cannot think\nwhatever I am t'd'with you. I am certain n'one was ever more\ngod-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. N'one in the whole\nworld ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs\nwhen you prayed you might come t'a green old age yourself and see your\nson grow up t'take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone\nfrom ever getting back t'your own home. I have n'doubt the women in\nsome foreign palace which Ulysses has got t'are gibing at him as all\nthese sluts here have been gibing at you. I d'not wonder at your not\nchoosing t'let them wash you after the manner in which they have\ninsulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope\nhas said that I am t'd'so; I will wash them both for Penelope's sake\nand for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of\ncompassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which pray attend\nto; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before\nnow, but I make bold t'say that n'one ever yet came wh'was s'like\nUlysses in figure, voice, and feet as you are.\"\n\"Those wh'have seen us both,\" answered Ulysses, \"have always said we\nwere wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.\"\nThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going t'wash his",

            "text": "feet, and poured plenty of cold water int'it, adding hot till the bath\nwas warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away\nfrom the light, for it occurred t'him that when the old woman had hold\nof his leg she would recognise a certain scar which it bore, whereon\nthe whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing\nher master, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by\na wild boar when he was hunting on Mt. Parnassus with his excellent\ngrandfather Autolycus\u2014wh'was the most accomplished thief and perjurer\nin the whole world\u2014and with the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had\nendowed him with this gift, for he used t'burn the thigh bones of\ngoats and kids t'him, s'he took pleasure in his companionship. It\nhappened once that Autolycus had gone t'Ithaca and had found the child\nof his daughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set\nthe infant upon his knees and said, \"Autolycus, you must find a name\nfor your grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.\"\n\"Son-in-law and daughter,\" replied Autolycus, \"call the child thus: I\nam highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and\nanother, both men and women; s'name the child 'Ulysses,' or the child\nof anger. When he grows up and comes t'visit his mother's family on\nMt. Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and\nwill send him on his way rejoicing.\"\nUlysses, therefore, went t'Parnassus t'get the presents from\nAutolycus, wh'with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome.\nHis grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his\nhead, and both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to\nget dinner ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five\nyear old bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it int'joints;\nthese they then cut carefully up int'smaller pieces and spitted them;\nthey roasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus\nthrough the livelong day t'the going down of the sun they feasted, and\nevery man had his full share s'that all were satisfied; but when the\nsun set and it came on dark, they went t'bed and enjoyed the boon of\nsleep.\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of\nAutolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too.\nThey climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy\nupland valleys; but as the sun was beginning t'beat upon the fields,\nfresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came t'a\nmountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the\nbeast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolycus,\namong whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear\nin his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick\nbrushwood, s'dense that the wind and rain could not get through it,\nnor could the sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick\nwith fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men's feet, and the\nhounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up t'him, s'he\nrushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay\nwith fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first t'raise his\nspear and try t'drive it int'the brute, but the boar was to'quick\nfor him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a\ngash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar,\nUlysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went\nright through him, s'that he fell groaning in the dust until the life\nwent out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the\ncarcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses' wound; then, after saying a\nspell t'stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But\nwhen Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made\nhim some splendid presents, and sent him back t'Ithaca with much\nmutual good will. When he got back, his father and mother were rejoiced\nt'see him, and asked him all about it, and how he had hurt himself to\nget the scar; s'he told them how the boar had ripped him when he was\nout hunting with Autolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.\nAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well\nhold of it, she recognised it and dropped the foot at once. The leg\nfell int'the bath, which rang out and was overturned, s'that all the\nwater was spilt on the ground; Euryclea's eyes between her joy and her\ngrief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught\nUlysses by the beard and said, \"My dear child, I am sure you must be\nUlysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched\nand handled you.\"\nAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting t'tell her\nthat her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable t'look\nin that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had\ndiverted her attention; s'Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with\nhis right hand and with his left drew her close t'him, and said,\n\"Nurse, d'you wish t'be the ruin of me, you wh'nursed me at your own\nbreast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to\nmy own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to\nrecognise me, hold your tongue, and d'not say a word about it t'any\none else in the house, for if you d'I tell you\u2014and it shall surely\nbe\u2014that if heaven grants me t'take the lives of these suitors, I will\nnot spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other\nwomen.\"\n\"My child,\" answered Euryclea, \"what are you talking about? You know\nvery well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my\ntongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay\nmy saying t'your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into\nyour hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house wh'have\nbeen ill-behaved, and of those wh'are guiltless.\"\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nurse, you ought not t'speak in that way; I am\nwell able t'form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your\ntongue and leave everything t'heaven.\"\nAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister t'fetch some more water,\nfor the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and\nanointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer t'the fire t'warm\nhimself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking\nt'him and said:\n\"Stranger, I should like t'speak with you briefly about another\nmatter. It is indeed nearly bed time\u2014for those, at least, wh'can sleep\nin spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such\nunmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending t'my duties and\nlooking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the\nwhole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us g't'bed, I lie\nawake thinking, and my heart becomes a prey t'the most incessant and\ncruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in\nthe early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many a\nplaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own\nchild Itylus, son of king Zethus, even s'does my mind toss and turn in\nits uncertainty whether I ought t'stay with my son here, and safeguard\nmy substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard\nt'public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is\nnot now time for me t'g'with the best of these suitors wh'are wooing\nme and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still\nyoung, and unable t'understand, he would not hear of my leaving my\nhusband's house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to\nd'so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his\nproperty. Listen, then, t'a dream that I have had and interpret it for\nme if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of\na trough,155 and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great\neagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into\nthe neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he\nsoared off int'the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;\nwhereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so\npiteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he\ncame back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke t'me with\nhuman voice, and told me t'leave off crying. 'Be of good courage,' he\nsaid, 'daughter of Icarius; this is n'dream, but a vision of good omen\nthat shall surely come t'pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no\nlonger an eagle, but your own husband, wh'am come back t'you, and who\nwill bring these suitors t'a disgraceful end.' On this I woke, and\nwhen I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as\nusual.\"\n\"This dream, Madam,\" replied Ulysses, \"can admit but of one\ninterpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be\nfulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single\none of them will escape.\"\nAnd Penelope answered, \"Stranger, dreams are very curious and\nunaccountable things, and they d'not by any means invariably come\ntrue. There are tw'gates through which these unsubstantial fancies\nproceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come",

This man, confident in his great\nwealth, was paying court t'the wife of Ulysses, and said t'the\nsuitors, \"Hear what I have t'say. The stranger has already had as\nlarge a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor\nreasonable t'ill-treat any guest of Telemachus wh'comes here.

If you had hit him I should\nhave run you through with my spear, and your father would have had to\nsee about getting you buried rather than married in this house.

I have long\nseen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have\nput up with this, for one man is n'match for many, but d'me no\nfurther violence. Still, if you wish t'kill me, kill me; I would far\nrather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after day\u2014guests\ninsulted, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an\nunseemly way.\"\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,\n\"N'one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it,\nfor it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the\nstranger, or any one else of the servants wh'are about the house; I\nwould say, however, a friendly word t'Telemachus and his mother, which\nI trust may commend itself t'both.

It would have been better that he should have returned, but it\nis now sufficiently clear that he will never d'so; therefore talk all\nthis quietly over with your mother, and tell her t'marry the best man,\nand the one wh'makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will\nyourself be able t'manage your own inheritance, and t'eat and drink\nin peace, while your mother will look after some other man's house, not\nyours.'\"\nT'this Telemachus answered, \"By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of\nmy unhappy father, wh'has either perished far from Ithaca, or is\nwandering in some distant land, I throw n'obstacles in the way of my\nmother's marriage; on the contrary I urge her t'choose whomsoever she\nwill, and I will give her numberless gifts int'the bargain, but I dare\nnot insist point blank that she shall leave the house against her own\nwishes. Heaven forbid that I should d'this.\"\nMinerva now made the suitors fall t'laughing immoderately, and set\ntheir wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.\nTheir meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and",

She went upstairs and\ngot the store-room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of\nivory; she then went with her maidens int'the store-room at the end of\nthe house, where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought\niron were kept, and where was als'his bow, and the quiver full of\ndeadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in\nLacedaemon\u2014Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The tw'fell in with one another\nin Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in\norder t'recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the\nMessenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had\nsailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these\nUlysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and\nthe other chieftains sent him on a mission t'recover them. Iphitus had\ngone there als't'try and get back twelve brood mares that he had\nlost, and the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were\nthe death of him in the end, for when he went t'the house of Jove's\nson, mighty Hercules, wh'performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules\nt'his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not\nheaven's vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set\nbefore Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the\nmares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and\ngave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used t'carry, and which\non his death had been left by him t'his son. Ulysses gave him in\nreturn a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast\nfriendship, although they never visited at one another's houses, for\nJove's son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could d'so. This bow,\nthen, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when\nhe sailed for Troy; he had used it s'long as he had been at home, but\nhad left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the\ncarpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it s'as t'get\nit quite straight; he had then set the door posts int'it and hung the\ndoors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the\nkey, and drove it straight home t'shoot back the bolts that held the\ndoors;161 these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a\nmeadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests\nstood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with\nfragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow\ncase from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees,\nweeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her\ntears had relieved her, she went t'the cloister where the suitors\nwere, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly arrows that\nwere inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing a chest that\ncontained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as prizes.\nWhen she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts\nsupporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before her face,\nand with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:\n\"Listen t'me you suitors, wh'persist in abusing the hospitality of\nthis house because its owner has been long absent, and without other\npretext than that you want t'marry me; this, then, being the prize\nthat you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of\nUlysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his\narrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this\nhouse of my lawful husband, s'goodly, and s'abounding in wealth. But\neven s'I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus t'set the bow and the pieces of iron\nbefore the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them t'd'as she had",

But, suitors, as the\ncontest has been agreed upon, let it g'forward. It is for a woman\nwhose peer is not t'be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in\nIthaca nor on the mainland.

This done, he went on t'the pavement\nt'make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his\nmight t'draw the string, and thrice he had t'leave off, though he had\nhoped t'string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for\nthe fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign\nt'check him in spite of all his eagerness. S'he said:\n\"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of n'prowess, or I am too\nyoung, and have not yet reached my full strength s'as t'be able to\nhold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, wh'are\nstronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.\"\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led\nint'the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow.",

He brought them with all speed to\nhis father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the\nswineherd als'put on their armour, and took their places near Ulysses.\nMeanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the\nsuitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows\ngave out, he set the bow t'stand against the end wall of the house by\nthe door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders;\non his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of\nhorse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,168 and he grasped two\nredoubtable bronze-shod spears.\nNow there was a trap door169 on the wall, while at one end of the\npavement170 there was an exit leading t'a narrow passage, and this\nexit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius t'stand\nby this door and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a\ntime. But Agelaus shouted out, \"Cannot some one g'up t'the trap door\nand tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once, and we\nshould soon make an end of this man and his shooting.\"\n\"This may not be, Agelaus,\" answered Melanthius, \"the mouth of the\nnarrow passage is dangerously near the entrance t'the outer court. One\nbrave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I\nwill do, I will bring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is\nthere that Ulysses and his son have put them.\"\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages t'the store-room\nof Ulysses' house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets\nand spears, and brought them back as fast as he could t'give them to\nthe suitors. Ulysses' heart began t'fail him when he saw the\nsuitors171 putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He saw\nthe greatness of the danger, and said t'Telemachus, \"Some one of the\nwomen inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be\nMelanthius.\"\nTelemachus answered, \"The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left\nthe store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I\nhave. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the\nwomen wh'is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the\nson of Dolius.\"\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going t'the\nstore room t'fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to\nUlysses wh'was beside him, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that\nscoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, wh'is going t'the store\nroom. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall I\nbring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many\nwrongs that he has done in your house?\"\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check,\nn'matter what they do; g'back both of you and bind Melanthius' hands\nand feet behind him. Throw him int'the store room and make the door\nfast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him\nclose up t'the rafters from a high bearing-post,172 that he may linger\non in an agony.\"\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went t'the\nstore room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was\nbusy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, s'the two\ntook their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by\nMelanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old dry-rotted\nshield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young,\nbut which had been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become\nunsewn; on this the tw'seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and\nthrew him struggling t'the ground. They bent his hands and feet well\nbehind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses\nhad told them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him\nup from a high pillar till he was close up t'the rafters, and over him\ndid you then vaunt, 'swineherd Eumaeus saying, \"Melanthius, you will\npass the night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well\nwhen morning comes from the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you\nt'be driving in your goats for the suitors t'feast on.\"\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on\ntheir armour they closed the door behind them and went back t'take\ntheir places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the",

Therefore you shall die.\"\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when\nhe was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground.

Then Ulysses searched the whole court\ncarefully over, t'see if anyone had managed t'hide himself and was\nstill living, but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in\ntheir blood. They were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of\nthe sea, and thrown upon the beach t'lie gasping for water till the\nheat of the sun makes an end of them. Even s'were the suitors lying\nall huddled up one against the other.\nThen Ulysses said t'Telemachus, \"Call nurse Euryclea; I have something\nt'say t'her.\"\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. \"Make\nhaste,\" said he, \"you old woman wh'have been set over all the other\nwomen in the house. Come outside; my father wishes t'speak t'you.\"\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's room\nand came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses\nbespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been\ndevouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so\nthat he is a fearful sight; even s'was Ulysses besmirched from head to\nfoot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of\nblood, she was beginning t'cry out for joy, for she saw that a great\ndeed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, \"Old woman,\" said he,\n\"rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and d'not make any noise about\nit; it is an unholy thing t'vaunt over dead men. Heaven's doom and\ntheir own evil deeds have brought these men t'destruction, for they\nrespected n'man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, wh'came\nnear them, and they have come t'a bad end as a punishment for their\nwickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women in the\nhouse have misconducted themselves, and wh'are innocent.\"176\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" answered Euryclea. \"There are\nfifty women in the house whom we teach t'd'things, such as carding\nwool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all177 have\nmisbehaved, and have been wanting in respect t'me, and als'to\nPenelope. They showed n'disrespect t'Telemachus, for he has only\nlately grown and his mother never permitted him t'give orders t'the\nfemale servants; but let me g'upstairs and tell your wife all that has\nhappened, for some god has been sending her t'sleep.\"\n\"D'not wake her yet,\" answered Ulysses, \"but tell the women wh'have\nmisconducted themselves t'come t'me.\"\nEuryclea left the cloister t'tell the women, and make them come to\nUlysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the\nswineherd. \"Begin,\" said he, \"t'remove the dead, and make the women\nhelp you. Then, get sponges and clean water t'swill down the tables\nand seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take\nthe women int'the space between the domed room and the wall of the\nouter court, and run them through with your swords till they are quite\ndead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used\nt'lie in secret with the suitors.\"\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.\nFirst they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one\nanother in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do\ntheir work quickly, s'they had t'carry the bodies out. When they had\ndone this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and\nwater, while Telemachus and the tw'others shovelled up the blood and\ndirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away and put it out\nof doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean and\norderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space\nbetween the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, s'that they\ncould not get away: and Telemachus said t'the other two, \"I shall not\nlet these women die a clean death, for they were insolent t'me and my\nmother, and used t'sleep with the suitors.\"\nS'saying he made a ship's cable fast t'one of the bearing-posts that\nsupported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the\nbuilding, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should touch\nthe ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been\nset for them in a thicket just as they were getting t'their nest, and\na terrible fate awaits them, even s'did the women have t'put their\nheads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably.178 Their\nfeet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister int'the inner\ncourt. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his\nvitals and gave them t'the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut\noff his hands and his feet.\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back\nint'the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said t'the dear old\nnurse Euryclea, \"Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and\nfetch fire als'that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters. Go,\nmoreover, and tell Penelope t'come here with her attendants, and also\nall the maidservants that are in the house.\"",

When one man has killed\nanother\u2014even though he was not one wh'would leave many friends t'take\nup his quarrel\u2014the man wh'has killed him must still say good bye to\nhis friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing the stay\nof a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you\nconsider this matter.\"\n\"Look t'it yourself, father,\" answered Telemachus, \"for they say you\nare the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is n'other\nmortal man wh'can compare with you. We will follow you with right good\nwill, nor shall you find us fail you in s'far as our strength holds\nout.\"\n\"I will say what I think will be best,\" answered Ulysses. \"First wash\nand put your shirts on; tell the maids als't'g't'their own room and\ndress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, s'that\nif people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some one going\nalong the street happens t'notice it, they may think there is a\nwedding in the house, and n'rumours about the death of the suitors\nwill get about in the town, before we can escape t'the woods upon my\nown land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven\nvouchsafes us shall seem wisest.\"\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed\nand put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took\nhis lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The\nhouse re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people\noutside said, \"I suppose the queen has been getting married at last.\nShe ought t'be ashamed of herself for not continuing t'protect her\nhusband's property until he comes home.\"182\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had\nbeen happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses\nin his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him\nlook taller and stronger than before; she als'made the hair grow thick\non the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;\nshe glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skilful\nworkman wh'has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva\u2014and\nhis work is full of beauty\u2014enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding\nit. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat\ndown opposite his wife on the seat he had left. \"My dear,\" said he,\n\"heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever\nyet had. N'other woman could bear t'keep away from her husband when\nhe had come back t'her after twenty years of absence, and after having\ngone through s'much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will\nsleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard as iron.\"\n\"My dear,\" answered Penelope, \"I have n'wish t'set myself up, nor to\ndepreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very well\nremember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.\nNevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he\nhimself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it\nwith fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.\"\nShe said this t'try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, \"Wife, I\nam much displeased at what you have just been saying. Wh'has been\ntaking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found it\na hard task, n'matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god\ncame and helped him t'shift it. There is n'man living, however strong\nand in his prime, wh'could move it from its place, for it is a\nmarvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a\nyoung olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour,\nand about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with\nstrong walls of stone and a roof t'cover them, and I made the doors\nstrong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive\ntree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root\nupwards and then worked with carpenter's tools well and skilfully,\nstraightening my work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into\na bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the\ncentre-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had finished it,\ninlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched a hide of\ncrimson leather from one side of it t'the other. S'you see I know all\nabout it, and I desire t'learn whether it is still there, or whether\nany one has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its\nroots.\"\nWhen she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke\ndown. She flew weeping t'his side, flung her arms about his neck, and\nkissed him. \"D'not be angry with me Ulysses,\" she cried, \"you, wh'are\nthe wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied\nus the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing old, together;\nd'not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you\nthus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all the time through\nfear that someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story;\nfor there are many very wicked people going about. Jove's daughter\nHelen would never have yielded herself t'a man from a foreign country,\nif she had known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and\nbring her back. Heaven put it in her heart t'd'wrong, and she gave no\nthought t'that sin, which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now,\nhowever, that you have convinced me by showing that you know all about\nour bed (which n'human being has ever seen but you and I and a single\nmaidservant, the daughter of Actor, wh'was given me by my father on my\nmarriage, and wh'keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I\nhave been I can mistrust n'longer.\"",

But\nnow let us g't'bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon\nof sleep.\"\n\"You shall g't'bed as soon as you please,\" replied Penelope, \"now\nthat the gods have sent you home t'your own good house and t'your\ncountry. But as heaven has put it in your mind t'speak of it, tell me\nabout the task that lies before you. I shall have t'hear about it\nlater, s'it is better that I should be told at once.\"\n\"My dear,\" answered Ulysses, \"why should you press me t'tell you?\nStill, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it. I\nd'not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide,\ncarrying an oar, till I came t'a country where the people have never\nheard of the sea, and d'not even mix salt with their food. They know\nnothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave\nme this certain token which I will not hide from you. He said that a\nwayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel\nthat I had on my shoulder. On this, I was t'fix my oar in the ground\nand sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar t'Neptune; after which I was\nt'g'home and offer hecatombs t'all the gods in heaven, one after the\nother. As for myself, he said that death should come t'me from the\nsea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when I was full of\nyears and peace of mind, and my people should bless me. All this, he\nsaid, should surely come t'pass.\"\nAnd Penelope said, \"If the gods are going t'vouchsafe you a happier\ntime in your old age, you may hope then t'have some respite from\nmisfortune.\"\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches\nand made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid\nthem, the nurse went back int'the house t'g't'her rest, leaving the\nbed chamber woman Eurynome183 t'show Ulysses and Penelope t'bed by\ntorch light. When she had conducted them t'their room she went back,\nand they then came joyfully t'the rites of their own old bed.\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and\nmade the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down t'sleep\nin the cloisters.\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking\nwith one another. She told him how much she had had t'bear in seeing\nthe house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors wh'had killed s'many\nsheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk s'many casks of wine.\nUlysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much trouble\nhe had himself given t'other people. He told her everything, and she\nwas s'delighted t'listen that she never went t'sleep till he had\nended his whole story.\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached\nthe fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops\nand how he had punished him for having s'ruthlessly eaten his brave\ncomrades; how he then went on t'Aeolus, wh'received him hospitably\nand furthered him on his way, but even s'he was not t'reach home, for\nt'his great grief a hurricane carried him out t'sea again; how he\nwent on t'the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed\nall his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only.\nThen he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed t'the\nchill house of Hades, t'consult the ghost of the Theban prophet\nTeiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who\nbore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the\nwondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on t'the wandering rocks and\nterrible Charybdis and t'Scylla, whom n'man had ever yet passed in\nsafety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove\ntherefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, s'that all his men\nperished together, himself alone being left alive; how at last he\nreached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso, wh'kept him there in\na cave, and fed him, and wanted him t'marry her, in which case she\nintended making him immortal s'that he should never grow old, but she\ncould not persuade him t'let her d'so; and how after much suffering\nhe had found his way t'the Phaeacians, wh'had treated him as though\nhe had been a god, and sent him back in a ship t'his own country after\nhaving given him gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was\nthe last thing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold\nupon him and eased the burden of his sorrows.\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that\nUlysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned\nDawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On\nthis, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said t'Penelope,\n\"Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here, in\nlamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home though\nI was longing all the time t'd'so. Now, however, that we have at last\ncome together, take care of the property that is in the house. As for\nthe sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take\nmany myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to\nmake good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now",

As\nbats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one of them\nhas fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even s'did the\nghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow led them down\nint'the dark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of\nOceanus and the rock Leucas, they came t'the gates of the sun and the\nland of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell\nthe souls and shadows of them that can labour n'more.\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of\nPatroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, wh'was the finest and handsomest man\nof all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of\nAgamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also\nthe ghosts of those wh'had perished with him in the house of\nAegisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.\n\"Son of Atreus,\" it said, \"we used t'say that Jove had loved you\nbetter from first t'last than any other hero, for you were captain\nover many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before\nTroy; yet the hand of death, which n'mortal can escape, was laid upon\nyou all to'early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the hey-day\nof your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your\nashes, and your son would have been heir t'your good name, whereas it\nhas now been your lot t'come t'a most miserable end.\"\n\"Happy son of Peleus,\" answered the ghost of Agamemnon, \"for having\ndied at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the\nAchaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the\nwhirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now of your\nchivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should we ever\nhave left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane t'stay us. Then, when\nwe had borne you t'the ships out of the fray, we laid you on your bed\nand cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments. The\nDanaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother,\nwhen she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and\nthe sound of a great wailing went forth over the waters s'that the\nAchaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled panic-stricken t'their\nships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked\nthem saying, 'Hold, Argives, fly not sons of the Achaeans, this is his\nmother coming from the sea with her immortal nymphs t'view the body of\nher son.'\n\"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared n'more. The daughters of the\nold man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in\nimmortal raiment. The nine muses als'came and lifted up their sweet\nvoices in lament\u2014calling and answering one another; there was not an\nArgive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights\nseven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the\neighteenth day we gave you t'the flames, and many a fat sheep with\nmany an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in\nraiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,\nhorse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were\nburning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of\nheaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak\nand laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a\ngolden vase t'hold them\u2014gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself;\nin this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus wh'had\ngone before you, and separate we enclosed als'those of Antilochus, who\nhad been closer t'you than any other of your comrades now that\nPatroclus was n'more.\n\"Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point\njutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far\nout upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born\nhereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them to\nbe contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been\npresent at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird\nthemselves and make ready t'contend for prizes on the death of some\ngreat chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death\nyour fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore\namong all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my\nfighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the\nhands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.\"\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up t'them with the\nghosts of the suitors wh'had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of\nAgamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to\nthem at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of\nMelaneus, wh'lived in Ithaca and had been his host, s'it began to\ntalk t'him.\n\"Amphimedon,\" it said, \"what has happened t'all you fine young men\u2014all\nof an age too\u2014that you are come down here under the ground? One could\npick n'finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds\nand waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an\nend of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or\nsheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of their wives and city?\nAnswer my question, for I have been your guest. D'you not remember how\nI came t'your house with Menelaus, t'persuade Ulysses t'join us with\nhis ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume our\nvoyage, for we had hard work t'persuade Ulysses t'come with us.\"\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king\nof men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you\nfully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.\nUlysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, wh'did not\nsay point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters t'an\nend, for she meant t'compass our destruction: this, then, was the\ntrick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and\nbegan t'work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweethearts,'\nsaid she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still, d'not press me t'marry\nagain immediately; wait\u2014for I would not have my skill in needlework\nperish unrecorded\u2014till I have completed a pall for the her'Laertes,\nagainst the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the\nwomen of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' This is\nwhat she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon\nher great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches\nagain by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without\nour finding it out, but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth\nyear, in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished, one\nof her maids wh'knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in\nthe act of undoing her work, s'she had t'finish it whether she would\nor no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had\nit washed,186 its splendour was as that of the sun or moon.\n\"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses t'the upland farm where his\nswineherd lives. Thither presently came als'his son, returning from a\nvoyage t'Pylos, and the tw'came t'the town when they had hatched\ntheir plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after\nhim, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and\nleaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came\ns'unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among\nus, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being\nstruck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but\nwhen the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus\ntook the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors\nbehind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a\nquantity of iron t'be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this\nwas the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string the\nbow\u2014nor nearly d'so. When it was about t'reach the hands of Ulysses,\nwe all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, n'matter\nwhat he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he\nhad got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow\nthrough the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured\nhis arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed\nAntinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly\ndarts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of\nthe gods was helping them, for they fell upon us with might and main\nthroughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as\nour brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with our\nblood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are\nlying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at\nhome d'not yet know what has happened, s'that they cannot lay us out\nand wash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according\nt'the offices due t'the departed.\"\n\"Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,\" replied the ghost of Agamemnon, \"you\nare indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare\nexcellence of understanding, and s'faithful t'her wedded lord as\nPenelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue\nshall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be\nwelcome t'all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far\notherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus wh'killed\nher lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has\nbrought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.\"\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the",

            "text": "bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the\ntown and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which\nhe had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with a\nlean-t'running all round it, where the slaves wh'worked for him slept\nand sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman,\nwh'looked after him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses got there,\nhe said t'his son and t'the other two:\n\"G't'the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.\nMeanwhile I want t'see whether my father will know me, or fail to\nrecognise me after s'long an absence.\"\nHe then took off his armour and gave it t'Eumaeus and Philoetius, who\nwent straight on t'the house, while he turned off int'the vineyard to\nmake trial of his father. As he went down int'the great orchard, he\ndid not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for\nthey were all gathering thorns t'make a fence for the vineyard, at the\nplace where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father\nalone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very\nshabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide t'save him\nfrom the brambles, and he als'wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat\nskin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone. When Ulysses saw\nhim s'worn, s'old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall\npear tree and began t'weep. He doubted whether t'embrace him, kiss\nhim, and tell him all about his having come home, or whether he should\nfirst question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it\nbest t'be crafty with him, s'in this mind he went up t'his father,\nwh'was bending down and digging about a plant.\n\"I see, sir,\" said Ulysses, \"that you are an excellent gardener\u2014what\npains you take with it, t'be sure. There is not a single plant, not a\nfig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of\nyour attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I\nsay that you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are\nold, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle\nthat your master takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and\nfigure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble\nbirth. I should have said that you were one of those wh'should wash\nwell, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right t'do;\nbut tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose\ngarden are you working? Tell me als'about another matter. Is this\nplace that I have come t'really Ithaca? I met a man just now wh'said\nso, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience t'hear my story\nout when I was asking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was\nstill living, or was already dead and in the house of Hades. Believe me\nwhen I tell you that this man came t'my house once when I was in my\nown country and never yet did any stranger come t'me whom I liked\nbetter. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father\nwas Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him\nwelcome t'all the abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave\nhim all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and\na cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve\nlight cloaks, and as many pieces of tapestry; I als'gave him twelve\ncloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal\nnumber of shirts. T'all this I added four good looking women skilled\nin all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.\"\nHis father shed tears and answered, \"Sir, you have indeed come t'the\ncountry that you have named, but it is fallen int'the hands of wicked\npeople. All this wealth of presents has been given t'n'purpose. If\nyou could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have\nentertained you hospitably and would have requited your presents amply\nwhen you left him\u2014as would have been only right considering what you\nhad already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is\nit since you entertained this guest\u2014my unhappy son, as ever was? Alas!\nHe has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have\neaten him, or he has fallen a prey t'the birds and wild beasts of some\ncontinent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, wh'were his parents,\ncould throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could\nhis excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as\nwas natural upon his death bed, and close his eyes according t'the\noffices due t'the departed. But now, tell me truly for I want t'know.\nWh'and whence are you\u2014tell me of your town and parents? Where is the\nship lying that has brought you and your men t'Ithaca? Or were you a\npassenger on some other man's ship, and those wh'brought you here have\ngone on their way and left you?\"\n\"I will tell you everything,\" answered Ulysses, \"quite truly. I come\nfrom Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who\nis the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off\nmy course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here\nagainst my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open\ncountry outside the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left\nmy country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left\nme. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced\nt'see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have\nanother friendly meeting and exchange presents.\"\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both\nhands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey\nhead, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched,\nand his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang\ntowards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, \"I am he,\nfather, about whom you are asking\u2014I have returned after having been\naway for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation\u2014we have\nn'time t'lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the\nsuitors in my house, t'punish them for their insolence and crimes.\"\n\"If you really are my son Ulysses,\" replied Laertes, \"and have come\nback again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity as\nshall convince me.\"\n\"First observe this scar,\" answered Ulysses, \"which I got from a boar's\ntusk when I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me\nt'Autolycus, my mother's father, t'receive the presents which when he\nwas over here he had promised t'give me. Furthermore I will point out\nt'you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all\nabout them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all,\nand you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me\nthirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also\nsaid you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted\nbetween each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of\nheaven has been laid heavy upon them.\"\nLaertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which\nhis son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to\nsupport him, or he would have gone off int'a swoon; but as soon as he\ncame to, and was beginning t'recover his senses, he said, \"'father\nJove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have\nreally been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am\nmuch afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here\ndirectly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the\ncities of the Cephallenians.\"\nUlysses answered, \"Take heart and d'not trouble yourself about that,\nbut let us g'int'the house hard by your garden. I have already told\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus t'g'on there and get dinner ready\nas soon as possible.\"\nThus conversing the tw'made their way towards the house. When they got\nthere they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting\nup meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took\nLaertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on\na good cloak, and Minerva came up t'him and gave him a more imposing\npresence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back\nhis son was surprised t'see him looking s'like an immortal, and said\nt'him, \"My dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much\ntaller and better-looking.\"\nLaertes answered, \"Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I\nwere the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took\nNericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I\nthen was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on, I\nshould have been able t'stand by you and help you against the suitors.\nI should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced\nt'see it.\"\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their\nwork and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his\nproper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and\nby old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their\nmother, the Sicel woman wh'looked after Laertes now that he was\ngrowing old, had been t'fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were\ncertain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses\nscolded them good naturedly and said, \"Sit down t'your dinner, old\nman, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting t'begin\nfor some time and have been waiting for you.\"\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up t'Ulysses. \"Sir,\" said\nhe, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, \"we have\nlong been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you t'us after\nwe had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper\nyou.187 But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or\nshall we send some one t'tell her?\"\n\"Old man,\" answered Ulysses, \"she knows already, s'you need not\ntrouble about that.\" On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius\ngathered round Ulysses t'give him greeting and embrace him one after\nthe other; then they took their seats in due order near Dolius their\nfather.\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round\nthe town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the\nsuitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered\nfrom every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.\nThey took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies\nof those wh'came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the\nfishermen t'take each of them t'his own place. They then met angrily\nin the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes\nrose t'speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son\nAntinous, wh'had been the first man killed by Ulysses, s'he said,\nweeping bitterly, \"My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great\nwrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he\nhas lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been\nkilling all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and\ndoing before he can get away t'Pylos or t'Elis where the Epeans rule,\nor we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an\neverlasting disgrace t'us if we d'not avenge the murder of our sons\nand brothers. For my own part I should have n'more pleasure in life,\nbut had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before\nthey can cross over t'the main land.\"\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard\nPhemius had now woke up, and came t'them from the house of Ulysses.\nEvery one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle\nof the assembly, and Medon said, \"Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did\nnot d'these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an\nimmortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god\nappeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously\nabout the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on\none another.\"\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of\nMastor, rose t'speak, for he was the only man among them wh'knew both\npast and future; s'he spoke t'them plainly and in all honesty,\nsaying,\n\"Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as\nthey have; you would not listen t'me, nor yet t'Mentor, when we bade\nyou check the folly of your sons wh'were doing much wrong in the\nwantonness of their hearts\u2014wasting the substance and dishonouring the\nwife of a chieftain wh'they thought would not return. Now, however,\nlet it be as I say, and d'as I tell you. D'not g'out against\nUlysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your\nown heads.\"\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at\nonce left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the\nspeech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;\nthey therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed\nthemselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led\nthem on in their folly. He thought he was going t'avenge the murder of\nhis son, whereas in truth he was never t'return, but was himself to\nperish in his attempt.\nThen Minerva said t'Jove, \"Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,\nanswer me this question\u2014What d'you propose t'do? Will you set them\nfighting still further, or will you make peace between them?\"\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your\nown arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the\nsuitors? D'whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be\nmost reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them\nswear t'a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to\nrule, while we cause the others t'forgive and forget the massacre of\ntheir sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as\nheretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.\"\nThis was what Minerva was already eager t'bring about, s'down she\ndarted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by\nsaying, \"Some of you g'out and see if they are not getting close up to\nus.\" S'one of Dolius's sons went as he was bid. Standing on the\nthreshold he could see them all quite near, and said t'Ulysses, \"Here\nthey are, let us put on our armour at once.\"\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could\u2014that is t'say Ulysses,\nhis three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes als'and Dolius did\nthe same\u2014warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they\nhad all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth,\nUlysses leading the way.\nThen Jove's daughter Minerva came up t'them, having assumed the form\nand voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said t'his\nson Telemachus, \"Telemachus, now that you are about t'fight in an\nengagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not t'disgrace\nyour ancestors, wh'were eminent for their strength and courage all the\nworld over.\"\n\"You say truly, my dear father,\" answered Telemachus, \"and you shall\nsee, if you will, that I am in n'mind t'disgrace your family.\"\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. \"Good heavens,\" he exclaimed,\n\"what a day I am enjoying: I d'indeed rejoice at it. My son and\ngrandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour.\"\nOn this Minerva came close up t'him and said, \"Son of Arceisius\u2014-best\nfriend I have in the world\u2014pray t'the blue-eyed damsel, and t'Jove\nher father; then poise your spear and hurl it.\"\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour int'him, and when he had prayed\nt'her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes' helmet, and\nthe spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his\narmour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily t'the ground.\nMeantime Ulysses and his son fell upon the front line of the foe and\nsmote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed\nevery one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,\nonly Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. \"Men of\nIthaca,\" she cried, \"cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at\nonce without further bloodshed.\"\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were s'frightened that their\narms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of\nthe goddess' voice, and they fled back t'the city for their lives. But\nUlysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down\nlike a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire\nthat fell just in front of Minerva, s'she said t'Ulysses, \"Ulysses,\nnoble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will be angry\nwith you.\"\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed\nthe form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace",
