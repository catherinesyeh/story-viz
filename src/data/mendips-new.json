I know with what zeal the spud is used; how large\nbare places are regarded with delight; how seed is scattered over them,\nwhich the birds watch with cunning glances from the neighbouring shrubs\nand trees, and pounce down upon, as soon as the diligent master of the\nplace, has straightened his aching back and turned it upon the scene of\nhis labours.\nThe dewy lawn before Fair Acres, with its beautiful mosaic of white and\ngold, fringed with circles of deepest crimson here and there, would not\nsuit the taste of the conventional gardener of these days; nor would the\nlow, irregular building which overlooked it, be considered an attractive\nor fitting residence, for the sons and daughters of the small country\nsquire in the ninth decade of the century.\nBut in the second decade, in which my story opens, things were\ndifferent. The country squire lived a country life. He farmed his own\nacres, he walked over his own fields; his 'stock' were individual cows\nand horses to him; he could pat each one and call it by its name. His\nhouse was his home, and the restlessness of travel, and longing for\nexcitement had not as yet, for the most part, disturbed either him or\nhis children.\nNow the resonant steam eagle, as it flies across the country side, seems\nto call upon the dwellers in rural districts to follow where it leads,\nand an isolated manorial farm like Fair Acres, and a family like the\nFalconers who inhabited it, are all but impossible to find nowadays.",

      "text": "touched with radiance the figure of a young girl who was standing by a\nwhite gate which led into a copse sloping upward to the crest of a hill,\nbehind the old manor, and crowned by a belt of fir-trees.\nJoyce had her hand on the latch of the gate, but paused for a moment to\nlook back on the landscape which lay stretched out before her.\nA peaceful valley was below, where the tower of Fair Acres church rose\nagainst a background of trees, now in their first fresh beauty. A few\ncottages with red roofs clustered round the church, and two or three\nfarms were sprinkled at a farther distance. A rugged outline of hills at\na higher level, showed where the Ebbor rocks open out a miniature\nCheddar, and on the other side of that little gorge lay the open\ncountry, where the city of the deep springs lies, with its noble\ncathedral, and quaint Close, and stately baronial Palace--the beautiful\ncathedral village of Wells.\nJoyce Falconer was looking forth upon life as upon this goodly\nlandscape. She was in the fresh spring-time of seventeen summers. Her\nfather called her Sunshine, and her brothers Birdie; while her mother,\nwho was a plain, practical person, and who indulged in no flights of\nfancy, would say, \"Joyce is the child's name; and what can suit her\nbetter? I don't like nick-names.\"\nNevertheless the nick-names held their own, and as Joyce stood by the\nwhite gate, a voice was heard resounding from the lawn below:\n\"Hallo, Sunshine!\"\n\"Father, come up the hill. It is so lovely this morning.\"\nThe squire advanced with steady, even footsteps. He was a fine, stalwart\nman, dressed in a stout suit of corduroy, and with leggings buttoned up\nto his knees. He carried a gun under his arm--more from habit than from\nany idea of using it just then--and close at his heels walked, with\nsedate and leisurely bearing, his chief friend and companion, a large\nretriever, Duke; while two little terriers, Nip and Pip, bustled about\nin every direction, scenting with their sharp noses, and occasionally\nturning upon each other to have a playful passage of arms which, though\naccompanied by ominous growls, meant nothing but fun.\n\"I am up first to-day, daddy!\" Joyce exclaimed, as she went down the\ngentle descent and linked her arm in her father's. \"I am first, and is\nnot it beautiful to be alive on such a day?\"\nThe squire paused, and putting his arm round his daughter's waist, he\nsaid, looking down at her with eyes of loving pride:\n\"Beautiful! yes,\" thinking, though he did not say so, that the most\nbeautiful thing in all that beautiful world was his little Sunshine, his\ndarling Joyce.\n\"I hope the weather will keep fine for the hay,\" he said; \"but the glass\nwent up with a gallop yesterday; still, it looks fair enough this\nmorning.\"\n\"When are we to begin to cut the grass, daddy?\"\n\"To-morrow, in the home meadow,\" was the reply. \"I am going into Wells\nto-day, for the magistrates' meeting.\"\n\"May I come, father?\"\n\"Well, I've no objection, if mother has not,\" was the answer. \"You must\nask her leave.\"\n\"I expect she will let me come. She is sure to have some shopping to do;\nand you don't like commissions at shops, daddy.\"\nThe squire gave a significant shrug of his broad shoulders, and then the\ntwo began to thread their way through the copse, and came out at last on\nthe side of the grass-covered hill, up which Joyce skipped with the\nlight step of a young fawn, with Nip and Pip scuffling along with her in\nthe highest glee, while the squire and Duke followed more slowly.",

      "text": "As she stood there in the light of the morning, Joyce Falconer was a\nfair picture of happy, joyous maidenhood. Her figure was lithe and\nsupple, and though I am afraid her lilac cotton frock would be despised\nas only fit for a maid-servant in these days, it became her well. It was\nmade with a full skirt and a loose body, cut rather low at the neck,\nwith sleeves which were large on the shoulder, gradually tightening to\nthe wrist, and displayed to advantage a well-rounded arm. Joyce's shoes\nwere thick; but though, perhaps, a trifle clumsy, they did not spoil the\nsymmetry of her pretty ankle and high-arched instep. Snowy \"tuckers\" of\ncrimped muslin were sewn into the neck and wrists of her gown, and she\nwore an apron with a bib; an old-fashioned apron, guiltless of bows or\nlace.\nHer abundant chestnut hair was gathered on the top of her small head,\nand fell in curls on either side of her smooth white brow; not concealed\nnow by the large Dunstable straw bonnet, which was hanging to her arm by\nthe strings, and left the gentle breeze of the morning free, to play\namongst the clustering curls, at their own sweet will.\nJoyce's features were regular, and her complexion rosy and healthy.\nIndeed, everything about her seemed to tell of youth and the full\nenjoyment of the gifts which God had given her.\n\"A perfect little rustic!\" her aunt in the Vicar's close at Wells called\nher sometimes, and would suggest to her father that a year or two at a\n\"finishing school\" would be an advantage.\nBut the squire could not bring himself to part from his only daughter,\nand her education had been, I am afraid, sadly neglected.\n\"Well, little one,\" Mr. Falconer said, as he seated himself on a rough\nwooden bench, \"what is this?\" touching the cover of a book that peeped\nfrom her apron pocket.\n\"It is a book, father, Charlotte lent me: Mrs. Hemans' poems.\"\n\"Ah! poetry is a good thing when it is kept in its right place.\"\n\"I have been learning a long poem called 'Edith,' and I repeat it when I\nam darning stockings, picking up a stitch for every word. Don't you\nunderstand, father?\"\n\"I never darned a stocking,\" he said, laughing.\n\"Ah! happy father! Mother has now given me six pairs of Melville's new\nsocks, to strengthen the heels. In and out, in and out with the long\nneedle; I have to try very hard not to grumble, so I say 'Edith' as a\ncomfort, and to help me on.\"\n'The woods--oh! solemn are the boundless woods\nOf the great Western world when day declines,\nAnd louder sounds the roll of distant floods,\nMore deep the rustling of the solemn pines;\nWhen darkness gathers o'er the stilly air,\nAnd mystery seems o'er every leaf to brood,\nAwful it is for human heart to bear\nThe weight and burden of the solitude.'\n\"Father,\" she said, suddenly stopping, \"you are thinking of something\nthat troubles you. I know it by the deep line on your forehead, between\nyour eyes. May I know, father?\"\n\"Well, Sunshine, I am troubled about Melville; he wants to go and see\nthe world, he says. I have given him as good an education as befits his\nstation in life. He has made little use of it; and the bills for the\nlast term at Oxford have been enormous.\"\n\"How shameful!\" Joyce exclaimed.\n\"Things are so different from what they were when I was a boy,\" the\nsquire said. \"Why, I never dreamed of anything beyond doing my duty\nhere. I took the farming business off your grandfather's shoulders\nbefore I was five-and-twenty. I was his steward, as Melville ought to be\nmine, and leave me free. As it is, I have to pay Watson, and look into\neverything myself, when I have a son of three-and-twenty, who ought to\ndo all this for me. I suppose it can't be helped,\" the squire said,\nstretching out his legs, and taking up the gun which had been resting\nagainst the bench, \"and as far as I can see the younger boys will be\nvery little, if any, better than Melville.\"\n\"Oh! yes, father. Ralph will do anything you wish, I know; and Hal and\nBunny are very good at school. Remember what the master said of them at\nChristmas.\"\n\"Yes, yes; they are good little fellows. Then there is poor Piers; he\nmust always be an anxiety, poor boy!\"\n\"I don't think any of us can be happier than Piers,\" Joyce said. \"He\nnever complains because he is lame; and he is as contented as possible,\nmaking his collection of moths and butterflies, and bird's eggs, and\nthings. No, father, don't be unhappy about Piers.\"\n\"Do you think, Joyce, I ever forget that it was my carelessness which\nmade the boy a cripple? I never forget it.\"\n\"No one else thinks of it, dear daddy,\" Joyce said, slipping her hand\ninto her father's, as it rested on his knee. \"No one else thinks of it;\nand you know the colt had been broken in, and----\"\n\"The child ought never to have put his legs across it, Joyce; and I\nlifted him on, and told him not to be a coward. Ah!\" said the squire,\nsuddenly starting to his feet. \"I cannot speak of it; I dare not.\"\nHe began an abrupt descent the way that they had come. Nip and Pip, who\nhad been sleeping with their noses on their paws, and one eye open,\nraced off, while Duke drew himself into a standing position, and walked\ndemurely down the steep bit of turf, with the brush of his tail waving\nfrom side to side as he went.\nJoyce did not follow immediately. Her bright face was clouded with the\nsympathy she felt for her father. It all came back to her: the group\nbefore the Manor, the child of eight years old, saying, \"I am afraid of\nriding Rioter, father.\" Then the father's answer, \"Afraid! Don't be a\ncoward, Piers; you have a good seat enough for such a little chap. Here,\nlet me put you on.\" The boy's white, set face, as he grasped the reins;\nand Rioter was off like lightning. \"His brothers rode long before they\nwere his age,\" the squire had said; \"it won't do to tie him to his\nmother's apron strings, because he happens to be the youngest.\" Then the\nsound of returning horse's feet, and Rioter rushed up the side drive to\nthe stables riderless. Another minute and old Thomas appeared with a\nlifeless burden in his arms, which the squire took from him, with a\ngroan of remorse, as he turned into the house with him and said to his\nwife, \"I have killed the boy.\"\nBut Piers was not killed. His injuries were life-long, but his life was\nspared.\nWhether it was from an instinctive feeling, that his father considered\nhimself the cause of his lameness and generally invalided condition, or\nwhether the latent buoyancy of his nature asserted itself above all the\nprivations which the accident had brought upon him, or whether both of\nthese causes were at work within him, certain it is that Piers was the\nmost cheerful and most uncomplaining member of the squire's household,\nand never allowed any one to pity him, or to treat him as an object of\ncompassion. Joyce was right when she said that no one was happier than",

I shall be all behindhand, if I don't look out. I wish\nMelville's fine gentleman visitor farther!\"\nMrs. Falconer spoke rapidly, and in rather a high key. Her accent was\ndecidedly provincial, and she did not measure out her words with the\nslow precision which her eldest son Melville considered a mark of _bon\nton_.\nMrs. Falconer was the daughter of a large farmer in a neighbouring\ncounty, and the squire had married her in haste, though he had never\nrepented at leisure.\nShe was thoroughly loyal-hearted and true as a wife and mother; brusque\nand blunt, holding all fine things and fine people in supreme contempt.\nAnd yet, according to the perversity of women-kind, she spoiled and\nindulged the son whose love of fine things seemed likely to be his bane,\nand brought perpetual trouble upon his good and honourable father.\nTo make bread and cakes, to skim milk, churn butter, at a pinch, and\nmake all the sweet, cooling drinks for the summer, and elderberry wine\nfor the winter, were domestic duties in which Mrs. Falconer gloried. She\nwould put on a large apron and a pair of dusting-gloves every morning\nand go the round of the parlours, and rub the old mahogany chair-backs\nand bureau with vigour, sprinkle the tea-leaves on stated days, and\nfollow one of her stout maid-servants, as they swept the carpets on\ntheir knees, with dustpan and brush, and remove every suspicion of\n\"fluff\" from every corner or crevice where it might be supposed to\naccumulate.\nWhile her children were young these household duties which their mother\ntook upon herself, were considered as a matter of course, but with added\nyears came added wisdom, to some of them at least, and Melville, her\neldest son, and her great darling and idol, began to show unmistakable\nsigns of annoyance, at his mother's household accomplishments.\nHe was at home now, and a stormy scene the night before had deepened the\nlines on the squire's brow; and hard things Melville had said were as\nsharp swords to his mother's soul. She was not particularly sensitive,\nit is true; by no means thin-skinned, or laying herself out--as is the\nfashion of some women of her temperament, to take offence. Still,\nMelville had succeeded the night before in wounding her in her tenderest\nplace, reminding her that while his father's pedigree could be stretched\nout to meet the royal blood of the Saxon kings, the race of sturdy\nyeomen, from which his mother came, had no blue blood in their veins and\nwere sons of the soil.\nThere is an old saying that \"sharper than a serpent's tooth is an\nungrateful child;\" and Mrs. Falconer was still smarting from the wound\ngiven her the evening before, when she began to dispense the excellent\nbreakfast, laid in a large, cool hall at the back of the manor, which\nwas connected, by a square opening in the thick wall, with the kitchen.\nThe squire, who was generally so jovial and cheery, ate his cold pressed\nbeef and drank his glass of \"home-brew\" in silence. He professed to be\nengrossed with a Bath paper several days old, and did not invite\nconversation.\nPiers played with some bread-and-milk his mother set before him: his\nappetite was never good; but Joyce despatched hot rolls and ham with a\ngreat appetite, which I am afraid would shock some of our modern notions\nnowadays.\nTea and coffee were not the staple beverages at breakfast in those\ntimes; but when the heavier part of the meal was over Joyce handed her\nfather a fragrant cup, with some thin toast done to a turn, for which\nMrs. Falconer called from the kitchen through the window, communicating\nwith it, and fitted with a sliding shutter, which was promptly closed\nwhen the tray had been received from the hands of one of the maids.\n\"So you are thinking of going into Wells to-day, Arthur?\" Mrs. Falconer\nsaid when, breakfast drawing to a conclusion, she began to pile the\nplates together, and put all the scraps on one, for the benefit of Nip\nand Pip, who had been lying in the window-seat for the past half-hour in\na state of suppressed excitement, with their noses on their paws, and\ntheir eyes fixed upon that end of the table where their mistress\npresided.\nThe noise made by the piling up of the plates was now a decided\nmovement, and Nip and Pip began to wriggle and leap, and finally subside\non their hind legs as Joyce called out: \"Trust, Nip! trust, Pip!\" and\nthen, after what she considered a due time spent in an erect position,\nthe plate was put down before them, and its contents vanished in a\ntwinkling.\n\"Well, Joyce, will you be ready by eleven o'clock?\" Mr. Falconer asked\nas he left the room.\nJoyce was silent, and her mother said:\n\"Yes, yes, she shall be ready; if she is brisk she can get through all I\nwant.\" Then Mrs. Falconer began to put all the silver into a wooden\nbowl, and rubbed it herself with the washleather when it was dried.\nShe had just finished this part of her daily routine when the door\nopened and her son Melville came in. His appearance would be ridiculous\nin the eyes of the dandies of to-day, but in his own, at least, it was\nas near perfection as possible.\nHis hair was curled in tight and very-much-oiled curls on his forehead\nand round his ears. He wore a high neckcloth, tied evidently with much\ncare, supporting his retreating chin. His coat was of Lincoln green,\nvery short in the waist, with large silver buttons, and turned back with\na wide collar to display two waistcoats, the white one only showing an\nedge beyond the darker one of deep salmon-colour, which opened to set\noff a frilled shirt. The trousers were tight, and caught at the ankles\nby straps, and his shoes were tied with large bows. The servile\nimitators of \"the first gentleman in Europe\" followed in his steps with\nas much precision as possible, and Melville Falconer spared no pains to\nlet the county folk of Somersetshire see what the real scion of _bon\nton_ looked like.\nMelville had a pleasant, weak face; he was almost entirely forgetful of\nthe interests or tastes of anyone but himself, and he had never given up\nhis own wishes for the sake of another in his life.\nHe had a ridiculous idea of his own importance, and a supreme contempt\nfor what he called old-fashioned usage; from the vantage-ground of\nsuperior wisdom he looked down on the county gentry of Somersetshire,\nwho, in those days, did not frequent London in the season, or tread hard\non the heels of the nobility in all their customs, as is now the case.\nThe great mercantile wealth which rose into colossal importance, when\nrailway traffic brought the small towns near the large ones, and the\nlarge ones near the metropolis, had not begun to overshadow the land;\nthe tide of speculation had not set in; and there was less hastening to\nbe rich and desire to display all that riches could give. It was a time\nof comparative stagnation, which preceded the great rush, which was to\nbear on its tide, as the stream of progress and discovery gathered\nstrength, the next generation with relentless power. Of all that lay\noutside Fair Acres, Mrs. Falconer was almost indifferent, if not\nignorant. She liked things as they were, and was averse to change, lest\nthat change should be for the worse. Her tongue, which was a sharp one,\nhad been swift to condemn the establishment of the schools in her\nneighbourhood, and she resisted all invitations from her husband to make\nthe acquaintance of Mrs. Hannah More. Teaching lads and lasses to read\nand write was, in the opinion of Mrs. Falconer, a crying evil. They had\nenough learning if they kept their church once a week, and as to\narithmetic, if they could count their own fingers it was enough; and\nshe, for one, would never take a servant who had schooling. \"A pack of\nnonsense,\" she called it; and she would tell Mrs. Hannah More so if only\nshe had the chance. Mrs. Falconer turned from her occupation at the\ntable, when her son entered.\n\"Breakfast!\" she exclaimed. \"No, indeed; breakfast is over and done\nwith. I can't keep the things about half the morning.\"\nThe prototype of the fine gentleman seated himself in a chair at the\ntable, and said in a drawling voice, suppressing a yawn:\n\"Joyce, get me some clean plates, and go and order a rasher of bacon;\nand let the eggs be poached; and----\"\nBut Mrs. Falconer pushed Joyce aside:\n\"No,\" she said; \"your sister has something else to do than wait on you.\nI'll get your breakfast; and if you have to wait an hour, it will serve\nyou right; lie-a-beds don't generally have sharp appetites.\"\n\"Nay, mother,\" Melville said, \"do not let the want of appetite be laid\nto my door, with so many other sins; I am particularly hungry this\nmorning. And I beseech you, do not do servant's work for _me_.\"\nMrs. Falconer's face betrayed that she felt the thrust.\n\"Servant's work must be done for folks too lazy to do it for\nthemselves,\" she said, as she let the heavy door swing behind her, and\nrepaired to the kitchen to prepare, far too carefully, a breakfast for\nher son.\nJoyce hesitated a moment, and then said:\n\"It always vexes mother when you are late, Melville. I wish you would\nget up earlier.\"\n\"My dear little sister, I should have vexed mother if I had come down at\nsix. She is out of temper with me, and so is my father, simply because I\ndesire to get a little education, to fit me for my position here, you\nknow, when I come into the place.\"\n\"Oh, Melville, you have had every advantage; you ought to know\neverything. But Aunt Letitia was quite right--the money spent upon you\nat Oxford was wasted.\"\n\"Thanks for your high opinion. I ought to be vastly grateful for it. But\nto speak of other things: I have bidden a friend to stay here for a\nweek. He will like country air, and to drink milk and curds-and-whey. He\narrives at Wells by the Bath mail; and I shall drive in with you and my\nfather, and hire a post-chaise at the Swan to bring him out.\"\n\"I hope he is not a fine gentleman,\" Joyce said.\n\"He is a very fine gentleman indeed,\" was the answer; \"and, Joyce,\npersuade mother _not_ to put on that big bib, and make herself look like\na housekeeper. It will appal Arundel, and make him feel out of his\nelement.\"\n\"If he is to feel that, what does he come for?\" Joyce said, angrily. \"We\nwant no upstarts here.\"\n\"Upstarts! that is fine talking. Arundel comes of one of the oldest\nfamilies in England. Not older than ours; though, unhappily, we live as\nif we had sprung from the gutter, and do not get any proper respect.\"\n\"Respect!\" exclaimed Joyce, indignantly. \"Respect! As if father were not\nrespected as a justice! and as if _you_----\" Joyce stopped; she felt too\nindignant to go on.\n\"My dear little sister,\" Melville said, with a grand air of pity--\"my\ndear little sister, you are only ignorant. If you knew a little more of\nthe habits and customs of the higher classes, you would not talk so\nfoolishly.\"\n\"I do not wish to know more about them if you have got _your_ habits\nfrom associating with them.\"\nMelville smiled, and did not betray the least irritation.\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"facts are stubborn things. Does it never strike\nyou, that though my father dines at the houses of the gentry in the\ncounty, sits on the bench, and rides to cover, you and my mother are not\ninvited to accompany him. The truth is my good mother dislikes the\nusages of _genteel_ life.\"\nMelville used that objectionable word with emphasis. Genteel was in\nthose days used as some of us now use words which are scarcely more\nsignificant, though generally accepted--\"Good form,\" \"A 1,\" and so\nforth.\n\"It is,\" Melville continued, grandly, \"the result of early associations;\nand so we eat heavy one o'clock meals and nine o'clock suppers, instead\nof dining at three or four o'clock; and my mother, instead of receiving\ncompany in the house, works in it like a servant. It is a vast pity, my\ndear. It keeps the family down, and destroys your chances in life. So I\nadvise you to try to alter things. Now Arundel is coming, I want to dine\nat a less outlandish hour, and I----\"\nWhatever Mr. Melville Falconer wanted Joyce did not stay to hear. She\nleft the large hall by one door as her mother entered by the other,\nbearing in her hand a tray of delicately prepared breakfast for her\nson, who was wholly unworthy of her attentions, and would have been\nbetter without them.\n\"Thank you, mother,\" Melville said. \"I hope the toast is not dried up.\nThere is so much skill even in the poaching of an egg.\"\n\"There are two ways of doing everything,\" was Mrs. Falconer's rejoinder.\n\"Now I must be quick, for I have a deal of work upstairs.\"\n\"Why should you have work, mother?\"\n\"Why did you invite a fine gentleman here? You had better answer that\nquestion. The best room must be got ready, and the feather bed laid\nbefore the fire.\"\n\"A fire in this weather!\" exclaimed Melville.\n\"No one ever sleeps in my house in an unaired bed; and never will, while\nI am mistress of it, that I can tell you. I hope your fine gentleman is\nnot one to scoff at plain people.\"\n\"Arundel is far too well bred to make invidious remarks. But for all\nthat, things may strike him as a little odd. I was going to suggest that\nwe should dine at four o'clock while he is here, and that the boys\nshould not sit down with us elders. It is not the custom in great\nhouses.\"\n\"It is the custom here, and mine is _not_ a great house: it is a\ncomfortable English home, where there is no waste, and no extravagance,\nand no show. I'll warrant your grand friend never slept in a better bed\nnor between finer sheets than he will to-night. They are as sweet as\nlavender can make them, and----\"\nMelville shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Nay, spare me, mother, and let us leave the arrangements of\nbed-chambers to the fitting people. And, if I might suggest it, let all\nthings wear their best appearance when Arundel arrives, including the\nmistress of the mansion. It is a pity when one so young and\ncomely-looking as my mother should pay such scant heed to the little\nfeminine ornaments which are----Phaugh! what is this? Positively a red\nant crawling from the bread-trencher. What a beast! Quick! catch it,\nmother. I hope we shall have no red ants when Arundel is here.\"\nMrs. Falconer darted down upon the ant with her forefinger, and speedily\ndespatched it, exclaiming there was a perfect plague of ants in the\nlarder, and she did not know how to be rid of them.\n\"Disgusting!\" said her son, carefully covering the body of the ant with\na leaf which had garnished the pat of butter. \"It is enough to make one\nsick. I must have a little brandy to settle myself, or rather, my\nbreakfast, before I start.\"\nMrs. Falconer made no response to this request. But the spirit-stand was\nin the sideboard, and when his mother was gone Melville helped himself\nto a pretty strong dram, and then lounged about till it was time to\nmount the \"four-wheel\" and drive into Wells.",

      "text": "Joyce waited to hear no more, but tripped away, turning, through a\nquaint archway, to the Cathedral Green, where the cathedral stood\nbefore her in all its majesty.\nThe great west front of Wells Cathedral has few rivals, and dull indeed\nmust be the heart that does not respond in some measure to its grandeur.\nInvoluntarily Joyce said, \"How beautiful!\" and then, leaving the road,\nshe passed through a turnstile and pursued her way under the shadow of a\nrow of limes, which skirted the wide expanse of turf before the\ncathedral.\nThe blue sky of the summer day over-arched the stately church, and a few\nwhite clouds sailed above the central tower. There were no jarring\nsounds of wheels, no tread of many feet, no traffic which could tell of\ntrade. Although it was high noontide, the stillness was profound: the\njackdaw's cry, the distant voices of children in the market-square, the\nrustle of the leaves in the trees, and a faint murmur of tinkling water,\nonly seemed to make the quiet more quiet, the silence more complete.\nThe great west door was open, and Joyce walked towards it, and passed\nunder it into the cool shadows of the nave. She had often done this\nbefore, going out from the north porch into the Close again, but to-day\nthere seemed, she scarcely knew why, the stirring of a new life within\nher.\n[Illustration: Wells Cathedral.]\nIt was the moment, perhaps, of crossing the barrier which divides\nchildhood from womanhood; the pause which comes in most young lives,\nwhen there is, as it were, a hush before the dawn of the coming day.\nJoyce had been silent during the drive from Fair Acres; her father had\ninvited no conversation, and a glance now and then at his profile as he\nsat on the high box seat at her side, had convinced Joyce that the lines\nof care on his forehead were not traced there without a reason.\nThe fop, who condescended to sit in the back seat of the cumbrous\nvehicle, indulged in sundry grumbles at the bad road, the dust, the slow\npace of Mavis the mare, the heat, and such like trifles, which were,\nhowever, sufficient to disturb the serenity of Melville Falconer.\nJoyce had felt ashamed and annoyed as she had never done before; and\nwhen a neighbouring squire jogged past on horseback with his son, and\nlooked back with a smile at the highly-decorated figure in the back\nseat, Joyce felt sure they were laughing at him! Why could not Melville\nwear a short riding coat like Charlie Paget, and top-boots, and bear\nhimself like a country gentleman, instead of bringing down London\nfashions into the heart of Somersetshire, and finding fault with\neverything in his own home; bring his fine friends there without\nwarning, and behave as if he were indeed monarch of all he surveyed.\nJoyce's sweet young face was shadowed with the awakening sense of\nresponsibility and the longing to do something, which might smooth the\nrough places in her father's life, which her brother apparently made\nwithout the slightest compunction.\nAs Joyce stood in the cathedral, not far from the north porch, her head\nraised towards the belfry-tower, which the great inverted arches\nsupport, a ray of sunshine entering at a window in the south transept\ntouched her figure, and illuminated it with a subdued and chastened\nbeauty. Her head was thrown back, and the high coal-scuttle or gipsy",

The\nVicar's Close, at the further end, is closed in by a small chapel, which\nentirely blocks the entrance, for any but foot passengers, who obtain\negress into the North Liberty by some uneven stone steps at the side of\nthe chapel, leading into the road a few feet above the level of the\nClose.\nIf Wells is quiet outside the Vicar's Close, it is quiet indeed within\nit. Since the summer day when Joyce went into the little garden before a\nhouse half-way up on the right side, the hand of the modern Wells\nbuilder and plasterer may have marred the complete effect, with stucco\nand sash-windows; but for the most part the houses in the second decade\nof the century were guiltless of plate glass and white-wash, and their\nantique frontage was, even more than now, one of the most picturesque\nfeatures of the city of Wells.\nJoyce had scarcely touched the bright brass handle of the bell when the\ndoor opened, and a girl of two or three and twenty sprang out.\n\"Oh, Joyce, how glad I am to see you! Come in Aunt Letitia, here is\nJoyce.\"\nMiss Falconer was in the parlour on the right-hand side of the little,\nlow-roofed lobby, and rose somewhat feebly from her chair by the wide\ngrate, which was gay with pots of flowers and evergreens.\n\"Well, my child, welcome.

But, oh! Aunt Lettice, nothing will ever make him into a farmer.\nHe is dressed to-day, to come into Wells, like a fine gentleman. I get\nso angry with Melville, Aunt Lettice.\"\n\"He will come round in time, my dear. Young men are often a little\ndifficult to manage, and then sober down so wonderfully.\"\n\"But Melville is twenty-three, nearly twenty-four, Aunt Lettice. Father\nhas given him every advantage, and all he wished for, and now he says he\ncannot possibly live a country gentleman's life.\"\n\"Oxford was a poor preparation for that life, I must own,\" said Miss\nFalconer; \"only it was natural perhaps, that your father should yield\nto your mother's wishes.\"\n\"Mother suffers the most,\" said Joyce hotly, \"far, far the most. It\nmakes me so angry when I think of the way mother is treated.\"\n\"My dear child, she has spoiled Melville, and this is the result.\"\n\"It would not be the result if Melville had an atom of gentleman-like\nfeeling. Looking down on mother, who----\" Joyce's voice faltered.\n\"It was unfortunate that your father married below him in the social\nscale; he was caught in the rebound, as we say. But all that is over and\ndone with: still, we may deplore it; though no one can respect your dear\nmother more than I do. Marriage,\" said Miss Falconer, slowly and\ndeliberately, \"has not been successful in our family. Charlotte's\nmother, our only sister, made a very unwise marriage, and her only child\nhas been thrown upon me to support. Not that I regret it. Charlotte is\nan amiable, gentle girl, and a companion to me. I have given her such\nadvantages as I could afford, and she is fairly accomplished. I had a\nvisitor yesterday I little expected, at her very advanced age. Mrs.\nHannah More paid her first call on our new Bishop, and was so obliging\nas to come on here. She was speaking of you with interest, my dear.\"\n\"Of me!\" exclaimed Joyce. \"What does she know of me?\"\n\"She knows about most people in the county; and, naturally, your\nmother's opposition to Mrs. More's views has reached her. She forbade a\ndairy-maid to read, who had once been in Mrs. More's school, and when\nshe disobeyed her, dismissed her on the spot. It was much to be\nregretted. Greatly as I respect your mother, I must confess this act\nannoyed me.\"\n\"Did Mrs. More mention it yesterday, Aunt Lettice?\"\n\"Yes; and she said she would like to have some communication with you.\nShe had seen you riding with your father, and was taken by your looks.\nShe inquired what education you had, and was shocked when I told her\nabsolutely none. I told her I had implored your father to send you to a\nboarding-school at Clifton, but that he was obstinate. For, with all his\ngood qualities, Joyce, we must concede that your father _is_ obstinate.\"\n\"He is determined to do what is right,\" said Joyce, \"if that is\nobstinacy.\"\nMiss Falconer smiled.\n\"I have known him longer than you have, little Joyce,\" she said. \"But\ntell me about this proposition of Mrs. More's: is it possible to carry\nit out? Mrs. More has such frequent attacks of illness, that it is well\nto lose no time. Shall I write to Mrs. More, and propose that you should\nspend a week at Barley Wood?\"\n\"Oh! I don't think mother could spare me for a week. Did Mrs. More ask\nCharlotte?\"\n\"No, but I may suggest it. Probably she thinks Charlotte is in good\nhands; she knows that I have not neglected her education. She has\nrefined, poetical tastes; she can work beautifully in coloured silks;\nshe can paint flowers, and she can play on the piano very prettily.\nThese are the accomplishments which we look for in a young gentlewoman;\nand----\"\n\"I have none of them!\" Joyce exclaimed; not hopelessly, but almost\ndefiantly: \"but, Aunt Lettice, I am not sure that I want them.\"\n\"Dear child, I am sure that you _do_ want them,\" was the reply, with a\nsmile. \"There is a want of 'finish' about you; the more to be\nlamented----\"\nMiss Falconer's speech was interrupted by the appearance of the neat\nmaid-servant, who laid the cloth, and set out, with the utmost\nprecision, the glasses and plates and dishes.\n\"We will adjourn to the sitting-room after dinner,\" Miss Falconer said.\n\"I am glad to be spared coming down twice in the day. It was fortunate\nthat I was seated in this room yesterday when Mrs. More called; she\ncould not have mounted the stairs. Oh! here is Charlotte. Now we will\nsit down to the table; say grace, dear Charlotte.\"\nCharlotte obeyed, and then the cover was lifted from a fowl, done to a\nturn; and Patty handed round the vegetables, and poured out cider for\nMiss Falconer, while Charlotte had a glass of port-wine, as she had been\nrather \"below par\" for a day or two; and Joyce drank water from\npreference.\nBefore the meal was concluded, Miss Falconer had decided that she would\nwrite to Mrs. More, and propose that her niece from Fair Acres should\naccept her invitation to Barley Wood, at such time as might be most\nconvenient to her to arrange it. She did not tell Joyce of this\ndecision, but she considered by making it she was conferring a real\nfavour on the \"little rustic,\" whose beauty she was inwardly comparing",

      "text": "The two girls set out, soon after dinner, for the market-place, where\nthe shops were situated. The market-place at Wells is not without its\npicturesque features; old gabled houses skirt the north side and part of\nthe south side, while a cross stands at the bottom of the square. Clear\nwater, from one of the many springs, which first attracted the College\nof Priests, in the time of Alfred's son Edward, to found their religious\nhouse in Wells, makes soft music as it runs down the streets in crystal\nstreams. Two quaint archways, or, as they were in old documents called,\nthe Palace Eye and the Deanery Eye, stand at the head of the\nmarket-square, and between them are two ancient houses, one of which was\nbuilt by Bishop Beckington, and has rooms over the porch, or gateway,\nthrough which foot-passengers pass into the Cathedral Green.\nThere is a delightful sense that life flows easily and peacefully at\nWells by the appearance of its citizens. The master of the large shop\nwhere the two girls stopped, was standing complacently at the door, his\nhands in his pockets, calmly surveying the rush of the cathedral\nchoristers across the square, for the first chime had sounded for\nafternoon service.\nJoyce was known as Squire Falconer's daughter at Fair Acres, and treated\nwith respect. She was conducted to a counter at the end of the dark, low\nshop, where the head shopwoman waited on her. Joyce's list of\ncommissions was for the most part of the homely and useful kind; but\nCharlotte was attracted by a display of gauze ribbons, then greatly\nin fashion, for the large loops worn on the crown of gipsy bonnets. She\nwas not proof against buying two yards of straw-coloured ribbon with a\nblue edge, and when the ring was pulled down the ends of her purse\nagain, it slipped off, for there was nothing left in it.\n[Illustration: The Market Place, Wells.]\n\"Look, Joyce, what lovely ribbon! Do get some, Joyce.\"\nBut Joyce was intently examining some homely towelling, and weighing the\nrespective merits of bird's-eye and huckaback.\n\"I don't want any ribbons,\" she said. \"Yes, it is pretty, but what are\nyou going to do with it?\" Then turning to the counter: \"I want a box of\nneedles--all sizes, and half-a-dozen reels of cotton, and----\"\n\"Joyce, I think I will go to the door while you are finishing all these\ndull things; and then----\"\nJoyce glanced at the large clock over the counter:\n\"Then, I think, we will go to the service, and if we are not too\nlate----\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" Charlotte said, eagerly. \"Do let us go, and come back to the\nchina-shop afterwards.\"\nCharlotte had her own reasons for desiring to go to the cathedral. The\nhero of her silent worship was Mr. Bamfylde, a new minor Canon, and it\nwas his week for doing the duty.\nJoyce completed her purchases, and left orders for them to be sent to\nthe Swan; and then, just as the last chime was ringing and the old clock\nstruck three, the two girls passed up the nave to the choir.",

      "text": "The work of restoration had not been begun, and the beautiful\nproportions of the choir of Wells Cathedral, were disfigured by high\nseats and an ugly pulpit. But Joyce's eyes were not critical, and she\ngave herself up to the soothing and elevating influence of the place,\nwithout any very distinct idea of why it was soothing and elevating. The\nservice was slovenly enough in those days, and the new minor Canon got\nthrough it as fast as he could. The choristers straggled in, with no\nregard to order, and the lay-vicars conversed freely with each other,\nnow and then giving the head of the chorister nearest to them a sharp\nrap with the corner of an anthem-book, or their own knuckles, through\nthe open desk. The boys' behaviour was a little better than that of the\nmen, for they had a wholesome fear of being reported to the Dean and\nChapter, and feeling the weight of the old Grammar School master's\nbirch-rod.\nWhen the service was half over there was a sound of feet and voice's in\none of the side aisles, and the Dean, who was in his stall, looked\nsharply round. The verger hobbled out to see what his coadjutor outside\nthe choir could be about, to allow such a disturbance. The verger was\nsound asleep, with his chin upon his capacious breast, and quite\nunconscious of the presence of the two young gentlemen who were chatting\nand laughing with each other, in the south transept.\nThe verger stumped after them, vainly endeavouring to rouse his heavy\nfriend, and said:\n\"There's service going on; you mustn't make a disturbance, gentlemen;\nit's contrary to the Dean's wishes.\"\nThe elder of the two men answered with a laugh, but the younger said:\n\"Be quiet, Falconer. Don't you hear they are reading prayers?\"\n\"Well, I am neither reading them nor saying them,\" was the answer. \"I\nhad enough of that at Pembroke. Now, old fellow, keep a civil tongue in\nyour head, will you?\" as the verger, angry at the contemptuous disregard\nof his commands, said:\n\"I'll turn you out, if you don't go peaceably.\"\nAgain another laugh; and the fat verger, who had now recovered from his\nheavy afternoon nap, came bearing down on the young men.\n\"You'll walk out this instant,\" he said, raising his staff of office.\n\"I wonder you ain't ashamed of yourself.\"\n\"No, my good man; on the contrary, I am proud of myself.\"\n\"Proud! Yes, a popinjay like you is proud enough, I'll warrant,\"\nmurmured the other verger.\n\"Can we get into the choir, Arundel?\"\n\"We had better wait here,\" was the answer. \"The service is nearly over.\nCome this way into the cloisters. Don't be aggressive, Falconer, and\nmake a row.\"\n\"I hate rows as much as you do,\" was the answer; \"but I am not inclined\nto knock under, to this pair of drivelling old idiots.\"\nI cannot say how this unseemly wrangle might have ended had not the\nverger in charge of the Dean heard the blowing of the organ pipes, which\nwas a warning that he was to hasten to perform his office, and conduct\nthe Dean back to the Deanery.\nAlmost immediately the organ sounded, and those who had taken part in\nthe service came out. Joyce and Charlotte were amongst the last of the\nvery scanty congregation.\nMelville, for reasons of his own, did not care to introduce his friend\nat that moment, and Mr. Arundel was quite unconscious that the fair face\nof which he caught sight, from under the shadow of the large bonnet,\nwas that of Melville's sister.\n\"What a sweet face!\" he thought; and then, as Joyce turned suddenly\ntowards the spot by the font where the two gentlemen were standing, a\nbright blush and smile, made her look irresistibly lovely.\n\"Who is that young lady, Melville? She knows you.\" For Joyce had made a\nstep forward, and then apparently changed her mind and went towards the\nnorth door with Charlotte.\nMelville fingered his cravat, and settled his chin in its place above\nit. \"That little girl dressed as if she came out of Noah's ark is my\nsister! Come, you will have another opportunity of cultivating her\nacquaintance, and you want to call at the Palace, don't you?\"\n\"My mother charged me to do so; but there is no haste.\"\n\"Oh, you had better not lose time, or you may not find your legs under\nthe Bishop's mahogany. We live some miles out, you know.\"\nMr. Arundel turned his head round twice to take a last look at the\nretreating figures, and then allowed Melville to tuck his arm in his,\nand walk down the cloisters with him to the Palace.\nMelville was in fact very anxious to show off his intimacy with Mr.\nArundel to the bishop, for he could not hide from himself the fact that\nthe ecclesiastical _\u00e9lite_ of Wells had not paid him the attention he\nhoped to receive. The truth was that rumours of Melville's gay and\ncareless life, and the anxiety he had given his father, had reached the\nears of some in authority. Heads of colleges reported his behaviour at\nOxford, and Melville had been sent down, not for what may be called\nserious offences; but still the character hung about him of a man who\ncared for nothing earnestly; reading or rowing, it was all alike.\nNothing that Melville did was done with singleness of purpose, except,\nas his father sometimes said, with a sigh, \"dress himself like a\nmountebank and copy London fashions.\"",

She was Annabella Thorndeane.\"\nThe bishop's somewhat stiff manner changed at once. He extended his\nhand, and said:\n\"To have known your mother is to bear her always in affectionate\nremembrance. Where is she living?\"\n\"Since my father's death, my lord, my mother has had no settled home.\nShe has lived within reach of me, first at Winchester, and then at\nOxford. Now she will settle where I do.\"\n\"And what profession are you taking, may I inquire?\"\n\"The law I believe; things are not yet decided, my lord; but there is\nsome notion of a partnership in Bristol, when I have passed the needful\nexaminations.\"\n\"Well, well, we must have lawyers, and can no more do without them than\ndoctors, eh?\" All this time Melville had fidgeted, and felt annoyed at\nthe bishop's coldness to him. \"I am alone just now in the Palace;\nhealth, or rather the search for health, has taken the ladies to the\neast coast, a very distant spot--Cromer in Norfolk. But bracing was\nrecommended, and our Western sea cannot come under that head.

Her\nfather waved his hand impatiently.\n[Illustration: S. Cuthbert's, Wells.]\n\"Come, Joyce; come, make haste!\"\nIn another moment she had mounted to her seat by his side, and they were\noff at a quick trot. The good old horse knew that her head was turned\nhomewards and went cheerily down the High Street, past the noble\nchurch of St. Cuthbert, where there was no traffic to impede its\nprogress.\nThe squire was silent until they were fairly out of the town, when he\nsaid:\n\"So your grand brother can't ride in his father's carriage! He and his\nfine friend may pay for the chaise; I shall not.\"\n\"I do not think the friend is fine after all,\" Joyce said; \"he laughed\nat the idea of the post-chaise.\"\nThe squire cracked his whip impatiently.\n\"He may well laugh. Ah! little Joyce, there are many graver questions at\nissue than the freaks of an over-indulged, reckless boy like Melville.\nWe had a stormy scene in the court to-day. That man who was let off a\nmonth, in gaol richly deserved punishment; but there was a division on\nthe bench and my conviction was overruled.\"\n\"Oh!\" Joyce exclaimed, \"I saw a crowd of rough people going up the\nBristol Road; they had taken a pony out of a cart, and were dragging it\nup the hill, with a man in it, who was half asleep.\"\n\"Half drunk,\" said the squire; \"that is more likely. They are a rough\nlot on Mendip, more like savages than the inhabitants of a civilised\ncountry.\"\n\"What is to be done to make them better, father? Has not Mrs. More tried\nto get the children taught?\"\n\"Yes, she has been trying for years to make the schools succeed; but\nthere is plenty of labour and little to show for it.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" said Joyce, \"there is some good done, though we don't see it.\nIt is always easier to see bad things than good ones; so easy to see\nfaults in those about us, and to be blind to their goodness.\"\nThe squire laughed; between this father and daughter there existed a\nsympathetic friendship wholly independent of the natural tie of parent\nand child.\n\"You are right, Joyce, quite right; but I am afraid one does not need\nglasses to find out the bad things.\"\n\"Father, let us put them on to find the good ones, then,\" Joyce\nrejoined.\nThe squire leaned back, and let the old horse go her own pace, and her\nown way.\n\"Ah! my little Joyce, that is wise advice. Thank God, I need no\nspectacles to find out the good in _you_. I look to you to keep things\nsmooth at home for the next few days, and to help me to do the same. I\nam quick-tempered, I know, and when I flare out, I am sorry afterwards.\"\n\"You don't often 'flare out,' as you say, to _me_, dear dad.\"\n\"What did your aunt say to you to-day?--called you her 'rustic,' I'll\nanswer for it.\"\n\"Oh, yes, of course she did; and she wants me to pay a grand visit to\nBarley Wood.\"\n\"To Barley Wood!--to Mrs. Hannah More! Mother won't hear of it. Your\naunt had better not meddle. What do you think about it yourself?\"\n\"I should like to pay a visit--a _short_ visit--to Barley Wood. That is\nquite different from going to school. But with the boys coming home, and\nMelville and his friend at Fair Acres, I doubt if I could be spared. It\nmight do me good to go, father; I mean, make me all the more useful at\nhome afterwards.\"\n\"What do you expect Mrs. Hannah More to do to you?--cut you into a\npattern, as she would cut an old woman's cloak, eh? However, if you wish\nto go, and any more is said, I'll manage it for you. Perhaps no more\n_will_ be said; your aunt is just as likely to forget all about it.\"\n\"Yes, I know that,\" Joyce said, with a little ring of disappointment in\nher voice.\n\"I'll tell you what pattern I would not have you cut into on any\naccount; and that is poor die-away, languishing Charlotte Benson. Poor\nthing! if she is a specimen of boarding-schools and accomplishments, I\nwould sooner have Jane Watson for a daughter.\"\n\"Charlotte paints flowers very well, father,\" Joyce said; \"and she has\nworked a figure in Berlin wool of a woman in a red gown feeding\nchickens; and----\"\nThey had been jogging along at a very leisurely pace, and the sound of\nfast-trotting horses made Joyce look back.\n\"To the right, father! quick! it's the post-chaise from the Swan.\"\nThe squire pulled up towards the high hedge, and the post-chaise dashed\npast, the luggage behind, and the two young men lying back in it. The\ngates of Fair Acres were in sight, and the carriage turned in with an\nimposing flourish of the post-boy's whip.\n\"Look here, Joyce, that is a sign of the times. That poor foolish\npopinjay of ours is only drifting on with the tide. He has brought\nanother young fellow, I daresay, as idle as himself, to eat my bread and\ngive himself airs. Well, I will put up with it for a week, and then\n_both_ have notice to quit; nor do I desire to see either of them darken\nmy door again. Melville shall travel if he likes, but it shall be across\nthe water--to America, where, if a little of this nonsense is not\nknocked out of him, my name is not Arthur Falconer.\"",

Thus it is to the first of these meals that I would bid you\nwelcome, as it is close upon eight o'clock now. Will you follow me to\nyour room?--which I hope you will find comfortable.\"\n\"I am sure I shall,\" said Mr. Arundel, warmly. \"It is very good of you,\nmadam, to invite me to Fair Acres.\"\nThese few words had passed in the hall; and the tap of Piers' crutches\nwas heard approaching, while Nip and Pip came bustling about the\nnew-comers, their short tails vibrating as if they were screwed on with\na wire!\n\"This is our youngest child, sir--Piers,\" Mrs. Falconer said.\n\"Where is Joyce, mother?\" Piers asked.\n\"Your sister is behind; our chaise passed her close to the gate.\"\n\"Why did not you come with her?\" Piers asked, bluntly.\n\"Because I was not allowed to do so,\" Mr. Arundel said, good-temperedly.\n\"I can tell you what you will be glad to hear, that your sister did not\nforget your sparrow-hawk.\"\nMelville, who had after all been wrangling with the postboy about his\ngratuity in a somewhat undignified manner, now came into the hall as his\nfather and Joyce appeared from a door under the wide staircase.\n\"Well,\" said the squire, \"you seem holding a counsel here; I hope it is\npeace, not war. Come, Melville, show your friend to his room.\"\nConsidering how greatly the squire had been annoyed by his son's driving\nout in the post-chaise, he spoke kindly and pleasantly; but Melville was\nalready assuming his grand airs.\n\"Here, Arundel,\" he said, \"I will take you to your room: first door on\nthe left, I suppose?\"\n\"You will allow me to do as I have done all my life, Melville,\" said his\nmother. \"I always go with my guests to their chambers, to see they are\ncomfortable. Now, Mr. A_run_del.\"\nTo Melville's horror, his mother put the accent on the second syllable.\nAnd as she tripped away--for her figure was still light and supple--he\nwhispered: \"He won't know who she means. Tell her, pray, not to say\nA_run_del.\"\nJoyce was indignant about the proceedings of the whole day, and she\nsaid:\n\"If you think it becoming to correct your mother, do it yourself.\" Then,\ngoing up to her father, she put her hand through his arm. \"Come and see\nthe last brood of chickens with me and Piers. They are lovely, dear\ndad.\"\nMelville turned away with a satirical smile on his lips, thinking it was\nimpossible to do anything with Joyce: she was content to let things\nremain as they were.\nMeantime his friend was conducted to the \"best room\" Mrs. Falconer had\nto offer--a spacious square room, with a large four-post bed, hung with\nwhite dimity, and so high that a pair of steps by which to climb into it\ndid not seem out of place.\nThe window was rather small for the size of the room, and the frames\nthick, but roses and honeysuckle hung their wreaths round it and\nperfumed the air.\nMrs. Falconer showed Mr. Arundel the high chest of drawers, and pointed\nto a hanging-closet, one of the top panels of which was glass, so that\nit might have a dim light from the room.\n\"I hope you will be comfortable,\" she said; \"the sheets are well aired,\nand so were the mattresses and beds, by the fire. I never trust to\nservants, but see to those things myself. We sup at nine o'clock; and if\nyou want anything please pull the bell.\"",

Three boys make\nsome difference in a house; but I dare say you will be out a great deal\nwith my son Melville.\" A scarcely perceptible sigh accompanied the\nwords, and then Mrs. Falconer vanished; on the stairs she met Melville.\n\"I say, mother, what have you got for supper? I hope there will be\nsomething that Arundel can eat. And, by the bye, mother, his name is\n_Ar_undel, not Ar_un_del.\"\n\"Oh, is it, indeed! I don't know that it matters what a man is called.\nAs to the supper, there's a round of beef, and a pie, and a baked\ncustard, and plenty of bread and cheese.\"\n\"I wish you could have some made dish to-morrow. Big joints are all very\nwell for a pack of hungry schoolboys.\"\nMrs. Falconer did not reply sharply, as she did sometimes. She turned\nand preceded Melville to his room, which was at the other end of the\nlong passage or corridor, which ran across the house, dividing it into\ntwo parts, front and back. Melville followed her, and assumed a careless\nand indifferent air, throwing himself on the deep window-seat and giving\na prolonged yawn.\nA pack of cards lay on the drawers, with a dicebox.\n\"We had high words last night, Melville,\" his mother began; \"and I was\nsorry----\"\n\"Don't scold or preach any more; I am sick of it. If you'll get my\nfather to let me travel, I'll come back in two years and settle into\nquite the country-gentleman; but you can't expect a fellow to bury\nhimself here at my age with a set of rustics.\"\n\"I have heard all this before,\" his mother said, in a sad voice, very\nunlike her usual sharp tones. \"What I want to ask is this: you have\nbrought your friend here without so much as consulting your father or\nme. I ask a plain question, is he a well-behaved man and fit to be the\nassociate of your sister and young brothers?\"\n\"Fit to associate with them! His mother is an Honourable, his\ngrandfather was a peer. Fit to associate with us, indeed, who are\nnothing but a pack of farmers!\"\n\"So you said last evening. I don't care a fig for lords and ladies; nor\nprinces either, for that matter: but this I say--if your friend teaches\nmy boys to gamble and drink, and is not to be trusted with your sister,\nbut may talk all kinds of rubbish to her, and you know it, you'll repent\nbringing him here to your latest day. I must just trust you, Melville,\nand if you say he is a well-behaved young man, well, I will believe you,\nand he is welcome to stay here.\"\n\"My good mother, you have got hold of the wrong end of the stick. The\nfact is Gilbert Arundel is a trifle _too_ good. He has a sort of mission\nto reform _me_. He has helped me out of scrapes and--well, I owe him\nsomething; and so, as he is of high family, I asked him to come here, as\nwe don't catch such folks often at Fair Acres. He said he would like a\nweek in the country, and he is looking after some place in Bristol,\nwhich is handy; so I asked him to come on here. Now are you satisfied?\"\n\"I know looks don't go for much,\" Mrs. Falconer said, \"but I do like\nhis looks very much; and his manners, too.\"\nMrs. Falconer hesitated, and seemed uncertain what she should say next.\nShe was not given to much demonstration of affection at any time, but\nher mother's heart yearned over this shallow-pated, self-indulgent son\nof hers. It seemed but yesterday that he was seated on her knee and\nthrowing his arms round her neck in his innocent childhood. But\nyesterday! and yet what a gulf lay between that time and this!\nShe could not have told why, or what innermost chord was touched, but\ncertain it is that she drew nearer Melville, and putting her hand on his\nforehead, and brushing back the stiff curls, which were persuaded by\npomade to lie in regular order on his head, she kissed him fondly.\n\"Oh! Melville,\" she said, \"my son, my son, you know how dearly I love\nyou. Do give up all your extravagant ways and high notions, and be a\ncomfort to your father and me, and set your young brothers a good\nexample.\"\nEven Melville was a little touched.\n\"Yes,\" he said, kissing his mother in return, \"yes, if you will let me\noff for a year, I will settle down and walk behind the plough, if you\nwish it then. Will that satisfy you?\"\nShe kissed him again, and saying, \"I will see what I can do with father\nabout your travelling,\" she resumed her accustomed brisk manner and left\nhim.",

      "text": "It was about five o'clock when the unusual sound of wheels was heard in\nthe road leading up to the house, and the squire, who was in the further\npart of the field, said:\n\"There's a carriage driving up! I think it is Mrs. More's.\"\n\"Mrs. More!\" exclaimed Mrs. Falconer, sharply. \"I hoped I had heard the\nlast of the dairy-maid.\"\nJoyce, who was at that moment seated on a haycock, with her rake thrown\ncarelessly at her side, sprang up. \"Did you say Mrs. More's carriage,\nfather? Oh, I am afraid--\" She stopped.\n\"Afraid of what?\" Gilbert Arundel asked.\n\"Oh, nothing; only Aunt Letitia said Mrs. More wanted to see me, or,\nrather, know me. Mother does not like Mrs. More, and Mrs. More thinks\nher very careless about the maids' education, just as Aunt Letitia\nthinks she is careless about mine; here comes Sarah.\"\n\"If you please, ma'am, I was to say Mrs. More wished you to come and\nspeak to her. She won't get out of the carriage, because her legs are\ntoo stiff.\"\n\"Come, my dear,\" the squire said, \"make haste, and go round to the front\ndoor.\"\n\"Not I. I shall not make haste; indeed, I'll send Joyce instead. Go,\nJoyce, at once. Say we are having a hay-making party, and end with a\nsupper when the last wain is carried; which, I'll be bound, she will\ncall sinful.\"\nJoyce had to free herself from the wisps of hay which clung to her, and\nto smooth her tangled curls. They were confined by combs and pins, but\nall had fallen out in the scrimmage in the hay, and they now fell on\neither side of her flushed face. Perhaps she had never looked more\nlovely than at that moment when, turning to her father, she said:\n\"Do you really wish me to go like this, dear dad?\"\n\"My dear, some one must go; and at once. Mrs. More is not a person to\nkeep waiting.\"\nJoyce did not delay a moment, but went with her quick, light step across\nthe field, and then through a little gate which opened into a belt of\nlow-growing shrubs, beyond which was the carriage-road from the village.\nAn old-fashioned _barouche_--old-fashioned even in those days--stood\nbefore the door, and sitting in it were two ladies; the elder one\nupright and alert, the younger leaning back as if to resign herself to\nthe long waiting time, before any of the family appeared.\nAlthough comparatively near neighbours in the county, Joyce never\nremembered to have seen Mrs. More before. Her name was familiar enough,\nand her schools, established on all sides, were known by every one,\nthough it cannot be said they were approved by every one.\nMrs. More and her sister had in times past made some overtures towards\nMrs. Falconer, but they were coldly repulsed, and a parcel of tracts had\neven been returned. Later there had been the disagreement about the\ndairy-maid, and the time for Mrs. Hannah More to carry the crusade into\nthe enemy's camp was over. She had, in the year 1824, nearly numbered\nher four-score years; and the loss of her sisters, and repeated attacks\nof illness, made her more willing to rest from her labours, only taking\ncare that the good seed sown in the days of health and vigour, should be\nwatered and cared for, that it might yield a good harvest.\nIt had happened that several times during the lovely spring of this year\nshe had met Joyce Falconer driving in the high gig with her father, or\ntrotting by his side on the rough pony, the use of which she shared with\nall her young brothers. The sweet, frank face had attracted her, and she\nhad inquired about Joyce when on a visit of ceremony at the Palace at\nWells a few weeks before.\nThe result was, as we know, that Miss Falconer gave a melancholy account\nof her niece's ignorance, which she believed was entirely due to her\nmother's prejudices as to boarding-schools and her father's\nover-indulgence and excessive affection for his only daughter.\nWith her accustomed sympathy with all the young who were just setting\nforth on life's journey, Mrs. More determined to see something of Mr.\nFalconer's little daughter, and her aunt's letter had decided her to\nlose no time in paying a visit to Fair Acres.\nAs Joyce came up to the steps of the carriage Mrs. More held out her\nhand--a white, delicately-formed hand, half covered by a lace mitten.\nJoyce had heard Mrs. More spoken of as an old lady of near eighty, and\nher surprise was written on her lovely face, as she said, simply:\n\"Are you Mrs. More?\"\nFor the beautiful dark eyes were still lustrous, and the lips, parted\nwith a smile, displayed a row of even teeth which many a young woman in\nthese days might envy. A quantity of white hair was turned back from a\nround, full forehead, which was shadowed by a drawn-silk riding-hood,\nwith a deep curtain and a wide bow under the chin. Intellect and\nbenevolence shone on the face, which was marked by few lines, and the\nstill young spirit lighted up the whole countenance as Mrs. More said:\n\"Yes, I am Mrs. More; and I have come to pay my respects to your good\nfather and mother, and to make your acquaintance.\"\n\"A great hay-making party is in the home meadow,\" Joyce said. \"My mother\nbids me present her apology; but my father will be here, I think,\nshortly. Will you not alight from the carriage?\"\n\"No, thank you kindly, my dear;\" and turning to Miss Frowde: \"my friend\nthinks me over-bold to drive so great a distance as this; but a desire\nto convey to you an invitation in person has brought me hither, in the\ndelightful cool of the summer afternoon.\"\n\"We must be getting home before the dew falls,\" Miss Frowde said,\naddressing Joyce for the first time; \"I have to take great care of\nprecious Mrs. More.\"\n\"Miss Frowde is kindly solicitous,\" the old lady said; \"I should be\nungrateful to disobey her orders so if I may ask for a drink of water\nfor the horses, and a cup of cider for the post-boy, we will not delay\nour departure beyond a few minutes.\"\n\"I am so sorry,\" Joyce began, \"that all the people are in the hay-field;\nbut I will send a message for a man who will attend to the horses, if\nyou will excuse me for a moment.\" She tripped away into the house, and\nvery soon the maid, who had been left in charge, was despatched to the\nhay-field, while Joyce returned to the carriage with a jug of milk and\ntwo glasses on a tray, with some sweet cakes of her own making, and\nsaid:\n\"May I ask you, madam, to take a glass of milk, as a little\nrefreshment?\"\nHannah More beamed down upon the sweet young face with her brightest\nsmile. She sipped the milk and told her companion to taste the lightest\nlittle cakes she ever ate; then she said:\n\"After all, I have not come to the real object of my call. I want your\nparents to spare you to me for a visit; and that you may not lack\ncompany, Miss Frowde will invite your cousin from the Close at Wells to\nmeet you.\"\n\"Thank you, madam,\" Joyce said; \"but I fear I cannot be spared during my\nlittle brothers' holidays. But here comes father.\"\nThe squire made the ladies in the carriage a low bow, and said the water\nwas ordered for the horses, and he much wished Mrs. More would alight\nfrom the carriage, and take some refreshment.\n\"The refreshment has been brought to me by the hands of your young\nHebe,\" Mrs. More said, smiling. \"As to alighting, my limbs are stiff\nwith age, and when once ensconced in my easy old chariot I am unwilling\nto leave it. But, Mr. Falconer, I came with a petition, for what is, I\nam sure, a precious possession: let me have your daughter at Barley Wood\nfor a month. I hope, God willing, to return your treasure, with interest\non the loan. Do not refuse me.\"\n\"Thank you kindly, madam,\" said the squire; \"but her mother must be\nconsulted. Her little brothers demand much of her attention in the\nholidays, and Joyce has to share her mother's labours in many ways. I\nfear she cannot be spared. What say you, my Sunshine?\"\n\"I could not be spared yet, father; but later--\" adding, with glistening\neyes--\"I should like to go to Barley Wood.\"\nThe squire put his arm round his daughter, and said:\n\"And I should like you to have the pleasure; but your mother----\"\n\"Well, well,\" Mrs. More said, \"then we will leave it, subject to certain\nconditions. The Bible meeting at Wrington comes on early in July. I\nshall have many excellent friends as my guests then, and the little\nSunshine--I like that name vastly--might dispense a little brightness\namongst us, and receive some solid good from intercourse with my friend.\nMay I hope to see you early in July?\"\n\"We will see about it, madam,\" the squire said; \"and both Sunshine and I\nfeel gratified by your kind proposal.\"\n\"Well, then, we leave it so, and I trust to you to drop me a line, my\nchild, when your visit can be made. We shall find a corner for you and\nyour cousin--if only a pigeonhole. You will not grumble, I dare say, but\nnestle in comfortably.\"\n\"The sun is getting low, dearest Mrs. More,\" Miss Frowde said; \"we\nshould be starting homewards.\"\n\"Yes, you are right.\" Then drawing from a large basket some books, Mrs.\nMore singled out one, and, bending down towards Joyce, said:\n\"This is the best of books; in it is to be found treasures of riches and\nknowledge. Accept the Bible from me, as a token of desire that now, in\nthe days of your youth, you may find the Pearl of great price. No one\ncan object to _this gift_, though objection to other books may be\nurged.\"\nJoyce took the Bible with a low-spoken \"Thank you!\" and her father\nglancing at it, said:\n\"You are very good to my little daughter, and I, at least, am grateful.\"\nThe squire had been secretly hoping that his wife would change her mind\nand appear, but his hopes were not realised. The carriage rolled off at\na leisurely even pace; the good-byes were said, but Mrs. Falconer did\nnot appear.\n\"It is a pity mother did not come,\" Joyce said. \"What a lovely old lady\nMrs. More is.\"\n\"Yes,\" and the squire sighed. \"You have got a Bible, Joyce.\"\n\"An old one, not like this,\" Joyce said, \"with gilt edges and such a\nnice purple binding; and I like to have it from Mrs. More. See, father,\nthere are pencil marks in it.\"\nThe squire looked over Joyce's shoulder at the page on which she had\nopened. It was the last chapter of Proverbs, and the words were\nunderlined: \"Her price is above rubies.\"\n\"Carry the book upstairs, Joyce; you had better not display it at",

      "text": "cloudless beauty. Fair Acres did not have the services of one clergyman,\nbut shared the ministrations of the vicar, with another small parish.\nThe cracked bell began to ring in a querulous, uncertain fashion on\nSunday morning, and punctually at half-past ten Mrs. Falconer marshalled\nher flock down the road to the church.\nThe church, though small, was architecturally a fine specimen of Early\nEnglish, and raised a noble tower to the sky; but the interior was\ndilapidated, and the pillars were covered with many coats of yellow\nwash, and the pews were hung with moth-eaten cloth. The squire's pew was\nlike a square room, with a fire-place and cushioned seats, and a high\ndesk for the books ran round it.\nMrs. Falconer and her husband sat facing each other on either side of\nthe door of the pew, and the boys were ranged round, while at the\nfurther end Joyce sat with Mr. Arundel, a place being left for Melville.\nJust as the clergyman had hurried on his very crumpled surplice, and the\nband in the gallery struck up the familiar air to which the morning hymn\nwas sung, Melville, dressed in his best, came up the uneven pavement of\nthe aisle with the proud consciousness of superiority to the rest of the\nworld. His father threw back the door, and he passed up to the further\nend of the seat, nodding carelessly to Mr. Arundel, who made no sign in\nreturn. Chatting and making engagements for the week was at this time\nvery common in church. There was scant reverence shown for the house of\nGod. He was a God afar off, and the formal recognition of some sort of\nallegiance to Him being respectable and necessary for the maintenance of\nsocial position, brought people like Mrs. Falconer to church Sunday\nafter Sunday.\nMrs. Falconer and the squire, with their family, were never absent from\ntheir places, and Mr. Watson, the squire's agent, acting as sidesman,\nwas also regular in his attendance.\nBut it was a lifeless mechanical service on the part of both minister\nand people; and the loud Amens of the old clerk were the only responses\nto be heard. The Psalms at the end of the book of Common Prayer were\nused, accompanied by a strangely-assorted band in the worm-eaten\ngallery, and two or three men and boys supplemented the scraping of the\nfiddle and bassoon with singing, which might well be called bawling.\nNor was Fair Acres an isolated instance of country parish churches; and\ncity churches, too, at this date. The great tide of the evangelical\nmovement had, it is true, set steadily in, and was soon to cover the\nkingdom with its healing and reviving waters; but its streams did not\npenetrate into the heart of the hills, and small outlying villages went\non, with no schools and no resident clergymen, and were contented\nbecause they were asleep.\nOf course the sound of \"the waters of Siloah\" were heard in\nSomersetshire as, one by one, Hannah More's schools grew and flourished,\nand, one by one, her enemies became her friends. But the apathy at Fair\nAcres on the part of the clergyman, and the determination of Mrs.\nFalconer to set her face like a flint against all innovations, was\nthought to be praiseworthy, and to show a laudable desire to resist\nmethodism in whatever form it took.\nGilbert Arundel's home-training had been very different from that of his\nfriend. His mother had early in life been brought in contact with\nseveral of the fathers of the evangelical school, and the spirit had\nquickened her faith into living heart service.\n\"How my mother would admire her!\" Gilbert thought, as he carried away\nwith him from the church the picture, in his mind, of the squire's young\ndaughter, as she followed the Psalms in the big prayer-book on the desk,\nand with her arm round Piers to steady him, pointed with her finger to\nthe words, reading the alternate verse with old Simkins, the clerk, in a\nvoice which Gilbert could barely catch, though he strained his ears to\ndo so.\nThere was an entire absence of self-consciousness in Joyce; and if the\nundulations of the small mirror over her high chest of drawers,\npermitted her to discern anything like the real reflection of her lovely\nface, she did not give it much thought.\nBrothers are not wont to admire their sisters or to tell them they are\nfair to look upon, and Joyce would have been very much surprised if she\nhad heard that her brother Melville said, she only wanted the\naccessories of fashionable dress to be accounted a belle at Bath or\nClifton, nay, even likely to make a sensation in the great world of\nLondon life.\nShe was a hopeless rustic now, but he saw in her capabilities which few\ngirls possessed.\nHe had said nothing about Joyce's beauty to Mr. Arundel, because he was,\nin his folly, ashamed to confess how devoid Joyce was of the ornaments\nwhich went so far to form his own estimate of a woman, and Mr. Arundel's\nsilence about Joyce, since that first day at the cathedral, seemed to\nhim to show that he only praised her at first, because she was his\nsister out of courtesy, and that he was, as every man of taste must be,\ndisappointed with her on nearer acquaintance. Superficial and foolish\nhimself, he was almost unable to appreciate the earnest sincerity of his\nfriend, and on this particular Sunday his temper had been tried by the\narrival of a letter from the Palace at Wells, brought over on the\nprevious evening by a special messenger, in which the Lord Bishop of\nBath and Wells requested the pleasure of Mr. Arundel's company at dinner\non the following Monday, but made no mention of him. He inwardly voted\nthe bishop \"a stupid old bat,\" as every one _must_ be who was blind to\nhis perfections!",

There was an attempt\nmade by their mother to enforce discipline on Sunday, from the same\nreason which made her scrupulous in attending church regularly. Besides,\nthe boys' best Sunday jackets and long tight trousers were in peril, if\ntheir usual habits of tree-climbing and birds' egg hunting were not laid\naside with their week-day garments.\nThe large Sunday dinner at one o'clock was always lengthened out to its\nutmost limit, but when that was over, the time hung heavy on hand.\nA smart box on Bunny's ear, administered by Melville, with a hand on\nwhich a huge ring glistened, and which left a pretty deep triangular cut\non the boy's ear, roused Piers' indignation.\n\"You coward,\" he said; \"just because he trod on your smart shoe. I would\nnot wear such a shoe for a hundred pounds.\"\n\"You are not very likely to be tried,\" was Melville's rejoinder. \"Your\nfeet are not made for shoes with buckles.\"\n\"Oh! Melville,\" Joyce exclaimed, \"how can you be so unkind?\" while his\nfather said, in a stern voice, \"If you have no brains, sir, I always\nthought you had a heart.\"\nMrs. Falconer was rising to follow Bunny, whose loud crying was heard in\nthe hall; but Joyce said:\n\"Mother, let me go.

      "text": "Joyce soon persuaded Bunny that he was not much hurt, and said if they\nwould all come up to the seat under the fir-tree she would read to them.\nThe boys willingly consented, and Joyce ran upstairs and fetched the\npretty Bible, bound in purple, with its gilt leaves, which she displayed\nto her admiring brothers.\n\"But you are not going to read _that_, Joyce,\" Piers said. \"Isn't it\ndull? Can't you find the Pilgrim's Progress?\"\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed Harry; \"I like the Giant Despair part, and the history\nof all the bones and skulls lying about.\"\n\"I will read about a giant,\" Joyce said, \"a very pretty story from the\nBible.\"\n\"Oh! I know,\" said Ralph; \"very well, I don't mind hearing it again.\"\nJoyce seated herself with her brothers round her, and read the familiar\nBible story, with a somewhat slow utterance, but with so much dramatic\npower in the tones of her voice that her listeners were profoundly\nattentive. Then she talked to them about David, and said she had read\nthat the story was a type of the great battle we had all to fight\nagainst the giant of self. She did not know that she had another\nlistener till her brothers had dispersed, and she was left on the seat\nwith the Bible in her hand. Then Mr. Arundel came through the little\ngate leading from the copse, and looking up at Joyce, said:\n\"May I come nearer?\"\nJoyce started to her feet.\n\"Take care,\" she said; \"the grass is very dry and slippery;\" and as\nGilbert Arundel made a rather scrambling ascent, Joyce advanced and\nheld out her hand to him to help him up the last few yards.\n\"I have been in hiding behind that tree by the gate,\" he said; \"I did\nnot like to disturb the boys by my presence, after the pains you had\ntaken to keep them quiet.\"\nJoyce's colour rose, and she said:\n\"I would rather you had let me know you were listening, especially when\nI was talking to the boys.\"\n\"Do not be vexed with me,\" Mr. Arundel said. \"I am so glad to have found\nyou here alone.\"\n\"I wanted to speak to you, too,\" she said, quickly, \"about my brother;\nhe is\"--she stopped, and then went on; \"I think I may say it to you--he\nis the one cloud over our happy life here at Fair Acres. It used not to\nbe so; he was very different once.\"\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Arundel said, \"I can quite imagine it was so. Your brother is\nvery weak of purpose, and he got into a bad set at the university where\nI found him.\"\n\"What made you care for him?\" Joyce said, simply; \"you are so different\nfrom him.\"\n\"Well, the story is rather a long one, and I do not know that all of it\nis fit for your ears, or that I ought to inflict it upon you. Still I\nthink you should know something about it. I feel an interest in poor\nMelville much the same interest which a man takes in anything that has\ncost him some trouble.\"\n\"What made you take any trouble about him?\" Joyce asked.\n\"I scarcely know; pity, I think, began it; and who could help pitying\nhim? He got into the hands of an unprincipled man, much older than\nhimself, who is, in fact, a relative of mine, and I did what I could to\nget him out of his clutches. He got all his money out of him, and then\npersuaded him to gamble to get more; of course ending in losing it.\"\n\"How dreadful!\" Joyce exclaimed. \"Does father know?\"\n\"He knows about the money part, of course; about the debts and\ndifficulties.\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce exclaimed, with a sigh, \"and it has troubled him greatly.\"\n\"What I wanted to say to you was, that I think if Melville went abroad,\nas he wishes, it might be a good thing, provided a safe companion could\nbe found for him.\"\n\"Will you go?\" Joyce said, eagerly.\n\"No, it is impossible; I could not leave my mother: I am all she has in\nthe world. We are going to live in Bristol, where I am to be articled to\na good firm of lawyers, and perhaps I may study afterwards for the\nbar.\"\n\"I thought you were of high family,\" Joyce said innocently.\n\"Would that prevent my taking to law?\" Gilbert asked, with a smile.\n\"No; I don't know exactly why it should do so,\" she said. \"Melville\ntalks so much about things which are right for a gentleman to do, and\nthings which a gentleman cannot do; and then he dresses so fashionably,\nand people remark upon it.\"\n\"I don't wonder,\" Gilbert said, laughing; \"but that part of his\nproceedings is only laughable. Many men are fops in their youth who tone\ndown wonderfully when they get old. Let us hope it will be so with him.\"\n\"You know,\" Joyce said, \"that Melville ought to spare father expenses\ninstead of adding to them. There have been two bad harvests and hard\nwinters, and Mr. Watson, the steward, is getting rather past his work.\nMelville ought to take that place now, and save father, for there is\nRalph to be educated, and he ought to have the _best_, for he is so\nstudious; and then there are the three other boys, and poor Piers is\nlame, and they all want something.\"\n\"You don't seem to want anything yourself,\" Mr. Arundel said.\n\"No: I have a happy home and everything is beautiful about me. What\n_can_ I want?\"\n\"Not to go to London, or Bath, or to see the world?\" he asked.\n\"I think,\" said Joyce, simply, \"if it came in my way--I mean if there\nwas plenty of money--I should like to travel a little. Can you believe\nthat I have only been to Bath once and to Bristol twice in my life? and\nI am nearly eighteen. My Cousin Charlotte, who lives at Wells with my\naunt, has been to school in Bath, but father never wished me to go to\nschool, so I have no accomplishments. But I need not talk any more about\nmyself, it cannot be interesting.\"\nGilbert Arundel was beginning a speech to the effect that what she said\nwas most interesting to him, but somehow it died away on his lips. The\nsweet earnestness of the face which he had been watching while she\nspoke, the entire absence of self-consciousness, seemed to lift her\nabove the level of compliments or flattery, which the gentlemen of the\ntime considered the rightful inheritance of the young ladies, with whom\nthey trifled for an hour's amusement.\nAs she sat with her face towards the beautiful landscape over which the\nwestering sun was casting its level rays, she seemed so far above him\nand bearing the \"lily in her hand\" of which a poet of later days than\nthose in which Joyce lived has said that--\n\"Gates of brass cannot withstand\nOne touch of that enchanted wand.\"\nThe silence which fell over Gilbert was unbroken for a few minutes by\nany word on either side. At last Joyce said:\n\"Is there anything I can do for Melville? He has rather a way of looking\ndown on me, and I think I speak crossly to him sometimes. I wish you\nwould tell me if you think I could help father about him.\"\n\"If he does not listen to _you_ I should think it hopeless that he would\nlisten to anyone,\" Gilbert said; \"he has a way of looking down on most\npeople.\"\n\"Not on _you_?\" Joyce said, with a little innocent laugh. \"He made us\nthink you were very grand and that we must alter all our ways to suit\nyou; poor mother was to change the hours for meals, and----\"\n\"I never heard such nonsense,\" Gilbert said; \"but I know where he got\nthose notions from, and I may tell you this much, that the kindest thing\nyou can do is to ask your father, to consent to his going abroad for a\nyear as soon as may be; he will be out of harm's way. I have had some\nfears that the person who had such an evil influence over him might\nfollow him here, and I was determined to circumvent him.\"\n\"It was very kind of you to take this trouble. Who is the person?\"\n\"He is a step-uncle of mine; my mother's half-brother, Lord Maythorne.\"\n\"Quite a grand person, then?\" Joyce said.\n\"Grand in his own eyes; yes, undoubtedly; but there is every hope that,\nhaving got what he can out of Melville, he will leave him alone. You do\nnot know how ashamed I am to own him as a relation; and I am anxious to\ndo all I can to atone for the mischief he may have done your brother.\"\n\"Was he at Oxford with Melville?\"\n\"No: but, unhappily, he has a small place near Oxford, and was\ncontinually coming in.\"\n\"Shall I tell father all about what you have told me?\"\n\"I have told him already a good deal. What I want you to do is to use\nevery effort to persuade your father to let Melville start soon.\"\n\"It would be far better if I could persuade Melville to stay here, and\nlearn about farming.\"\n\"Yes; but that, I am afraid, you will never do; and considering that\nyour father wished him to work on the estate it was a mistake to send\nhim to Oxford at all.\"\n\"Oh, yes; but it was mother's wish, you know,\" Joyce said, with a\nheightened colour. \"Mother always feels that her family was not\nconsidered as good as father's; they were simple, homely, good people,\nbut not what are called gentry, and I think it has always been mother's\ndesire that Melville should have exactly the same advantages as the sons\nof our neighbours. Charlie Paget went to Oxford; they live at Ebbor\nCourt; and so it seemed her eldest son ought to go. It is so strange\nthat mother should be quite consistent on every subject but one, and\nthat one, the indulgence of Melville; and now I believe he will break\nher heart.\"\n\"No, no, I trust not so bad as that,\" Mr. Arundel said. \"I have hopes\nthat there will be a change for the better, and all this folly and aping\nhis betters will drop off like an old cloak one day.\"\nJoyce sighed.\n\"I wish I could have hopes too; there is always, I suppose, some cloud\nin everyone's sky; and we are so happy, that if it were not for\nMelville, we should have all we wished for. Yesterday in the hay-field I\nfelt as if even to be alive was delicious, everything was so bright and\njoyful. Then Mrs. Hannah More came and invited me to Barley Wood. Have\nyou heard of Mrs. More?\"\n\"Yes, I think I have. A very good old lady, who has set up schools for\nthe poor children. My mother knows all about her. Will you like going to\nBarley Hill?\"\n\"Barley Wood,\" Joyce corrected. \"Yes, I think I shall. Charlotte is to\ncome also; and I dare say I shall like it when I am there, and it may do\nme good. You know Aunt Letitia always calls me 'a little rustic.' Of\ncourse I _am_, but I do not know that it is of such great consequence as\nAunt Letitia thinks.\"\n\"It would be a pity, indeed, if you were anything but what you are,\"\nGilbert said earnestly. \"A change could hardly be an improvement.\"\n\"Oh, do not say that,\" Joyce said. \"I want to _know_ more, and though I\nread everything I can in father's library, I do not get any new books.\nRalph helps me with Latin, and Piers and I learn French together, though\nI expect our pronunciation would make you laugh. We have just read\nMadame de Stael's 'Corinne' and a story called 'Matilde,' which\nCharlotte lent me. Is not Piers wonderful?\" she asked; \"he is so happy,\nand have you seen his collection of moths and butterflies? You must come\ninto his room and see them.\"\n\"Yes, I should like to do so very much, if you will be showwoman.\"\nHe liked to hear her talk of her simple home pleasures and interests; he\nliked to watch the ever-changing expression of her lovely face; he felt\nwithin himself that this hour on the hill-side, was to remain a bright\nmemory with him for many a day, to which he would recur with pleasure,\nand over which no cloud could come.",

From the time of Piers' accident Joyce had constituted herself\nhis helper and friend. Mrs. Falconer in her busy life could not devote\nherself to her crippled boy, as mothers of a less energetic and active\nnature might have done.\nJoyce and she had it is true one aim in common: to hide from the father\nthe sad consequences of that one rash act which had shut Piers out for\never from the free, joyous life of his young vigorous brothers. Mrs.\nFalconer did this by apparently making light of her boy's ailments, and\ninability to do what others did.\nIt was a good thing, she would say, that he could not climb trees and\ntear his clothes, or get into the stream by Wookey and ruin his boots\nand socks, or make her anxious by carrying a gun behind his father, in\nthe time of rabbit and rook shooting.\nMrs. Falconer never betrayed what was indeed the truth, that the sound\nof Piers' crutches as they tapped across the old stone pavement of the\nhall, sent a thrill of sorrow through her breast, and that when Piers\nwas laid up, as was not unfrequently the case, with an attack of pain in\nthe hip which had been so severely injured, she avoided being much with\nhim, and left him to Joyce, because the sight of his suffering brought\nback the memory of that morning when she saw him clinging with a\nfrightened face to Rioter's back, and heard her husband say, \"Don't make\na coward of the boy: his brothers rode long before his age.\"\nShe knew too well how bitter had been her husband's self-reproaches,\nand she dreaded adding to them by any impulsive, unguarded word of her\nown.\nThus it was that Joyce was sister, mother, and friend to her lame\nbrother. Their lives were bound up together, and the bond strengthened\nas time went on.\nIt was sufficient reward for Joyce to know that, however irritable when\nin pain, or depressed sometimes by a sudden reminder of his helplessness\nwhen contrasted with his brother's independence and vigour, she could\nalways be sufficient to charm away the cloud by her own sunny\nbrightness, and that by making his interests hers, she never let him\nthink she did anything for him, which was not a real pleasure to\nherself.\nThe secret of heart service lies in this, that those who are served\nnever know it to its full extent, and that any effort that may be made,\nor any trouble that may be taken, is so hidden under the mantle of\nall-pervading love that it is often wholly unsuspected.

He dreaded to\nchange the present happy relations between him and Joyce by telling her\nwhat he felt. She confided so entirely in him; she told him so much of\nher little joys, and home happiness, of Ralph's cleverness, of Harry and\nBunny's frantic desires to be sailors, of her father's goodness to\nMelville, and infinite patience with him. On this last night especially,\nhe felt that he could not bring himself to break the spell, and disturb\nthe serenity of that sweet, pure life, by letting friendship go, to\nreplace it by the more tumultuous and passionate love, which he knew if\nonce this barrier were broken down, he should pour forth on her in a\ntorrent which might distress and almost frighten, one so simple and so\nunversed in the world's ways.\nWhilst Charlotte was always on the look-out for some _preux chevalier_,\nwho was to be at her feet and vow eternal devotion, Joyce had as yet no\nsuch airy castles. Her education had been widely different from her\ncousin's, and home and home interests had so filled her seventeen years\nwith their joys and pleasures, that she had no time to dream over\n\"keepsakes,\" and read Miss Burney's romances, or steep herself in the\nunreality of sentimental verses, which Wordsworth was beginning to break\ndown and send into the shadows, by bringing out the beauties of\ncreation into the strong light, which his genius threw around them.\nJoyce had not wasted her youth in foolish dreams of impossible\nperfection, but when the real story of her life was ready to unfold\nitself, she would find a zest and fulness in it, that the sentimental\nvisionary could never know.\nThat was a memorable walk over the sweet country side, with the west all\naglow, and the sky above serenely blue. In after years both looked back\non it through that mist of tender sadness, which gathers round the happy\npast of youth, even though the present is full of the fruition of joy to\nwhich that very past led.\n\"This is our last evening,\" Gilbert said; \"I hope, if I can be of any\nuse, you will write to me.\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said, \"and I feel as if the worst were over now. If\nMelville has a year abroad with the gentleman the bishop recommends, he\nmay settle afterwards. Of course it is a great pull upon father's purse;\nbut if Harry and Bunny can get into the navy we shall be able to\nmanage.\"\n\"When we are settled in Clifton I hope you will come and see my mother.\"\n\"Oh! I should like that very much; but I have a visit to Barley Wood to\ncome first, and then in the winter I must do all I can to cheer father.\nHe feels the want of out-door exercise now he has given up his hunters.\nHe used to ride to the meet very often.\"\n\"I am sorry he has had to give that up, all through Melville's\nextravagance.\"\n\"Yes, and then farming has been so bad the last year or two.

My father only did his duty on the bench that\nday. You were guilty, and you know it; you got off unpunished, and you\nshould be thankful, and try to lead a better life.\"\nThere was something wonderfully grand in the way Joyce spoke, though her\nface was white with girlish fear, and her lips quivered, her voice did\nnot falter as she appealed to the huge man who might, she knew, shake\noff Gilbert's restraining hand, and spring on her at any moment.\n\"Let me pass,\" she said, \"and this gentleman will----\"\nAt this moment a woman's voice was heard, and a girl with a red\nhandkerchief on her head, with an effort at respectable attire in her\nshort, blue cotton frock, and large, thick boots, came over the tangled\nmass of heath and ling, and cried:\n\"Father! What are you about now, father?\"\n\"You mind your own business, you hussy, and leave me alone.\"\n\"Oh, father!\" the girl said, passionately, \"I wish you would be good.\nThink how mother used to pray for you! Oh, dear lady,\" the girl said,\nbursting into tears, \"I am heart-broken about father. Please, sir, let\nhim go.\"\n\"Let me go!\" said the giant, with a loud, discordant laugh; \"I'll see\nabout that.\" Then, with a mighty effort, he hurled Gilbert from him, and\nbefore he could recover his feet, he had seized Joyce's arm. \"Give me\nthe money, or I'll be even with your father; curse him!\"\nBut the girl threw herself on her father and held him back, while\nGilbert, stunned and bewildered by the force with which he had been\nhurled over the heather, staggered to his feet again, and, with a\nwell-aimed blow at the back of the man's head, laid him sprawling on\nthe path.\n\"Oh! I hope he is not hurt!\" Joyce exclaimed involuntarily, as the huge\nform lay motionless; the girl leaning over him.\n\"He is not hurt,\" Gilbert said, \"any more than he has hurt me; it was in\nself-defence,\" he added.\n\"Father, father!\" moaned the girl. \"Oh, sir! oh, miss! I don't know what\nto do!\"\n\"Hold your tongue, and let me get up and at him again,\" growled the man,\nstruggling to sit upright.\nBut his daughter had the advantage, and seated herself on her father's\nchest, saying to Gilbert, \"I'll keep him quiet till you are out of\nsight, sir; I will indeed. I know you were driven to do it,\" she said.\n\"Father is always fighting; but, oh! sir, we have a hard time of it.\nThere is no work for the men and boys, and if it were not for the good\nlady's schools, and the help she gives, I don't know what would become\nof us.

Mother died last\nfall; and though Mrs. More sent her physic, and the schoolmistress\nbroth, she could not stand up against the fever, and trouble about poor\nfather and Jim, and Dick, and the baby.\"\nJoyce's eyes filled with tears. \"What is to be done?\" she said,\nhelplessly; \"what can be done?\"\n\"I don't know, miss; I don't know.

How old\nis the baby?\"\n\"Born when mother died--just nine months old; he is so pretty, he is!\"\nJoyce had seldom, if ever, spoken familiarly to any of the girls about\nthe country side before. Mrs. Falconer had her views on the subject, and\nthe \"miner folks\" were her especial aversion, while Mrs. More's attempts\nto civilise them were met with derision and scorn. The gulf set between\nher and her household of respectable maids, and the rough, half-clothed\nminer's families, was in her eyes impassable! What was the use of\ntrying to reclaim those who preferred their own rough and evil ways?\nThey ought to be well punished for raids made on farm yards, and snares\nset in copses and plantations; but to teach them to read, and talk to\nthem about their duty to God and their neighbour, was in Mrs. Falconer's\neyes worse than lost labour; it did harm rather than good.\nAnd not only by Mrs. Falconer was this view of the unclothed and\nunwashed masses taken! In our days of widely spread and organised\ncharities, and zeal, sometimes I fear hardly tempered with wisdom, it is\ndifficult to throw ourselves back to the beginning of the century now\ndrawing to its close, when efforts like those of the four sisters of the\nMendips, of whom Hannah was the leading spirit, were met with scoffs and\ndisapproval; or deep compassion, that educated women could be so\nmisguided, as to wish to teach the boys and girls of their district,\nanything but to use their legs and arms in the service of their betters!\nAs I stood by the heavy stone in Wrington churchyard, in the gloom of\nan autumn afternoon, where the names of the four sisters are inscribed,\nI could but think of the gratitude we ought to feel to them for their\nbrave efforts to spread the knowledge of the religion of Christ amongst\nthe poor of those 'rolling hills' and peaceful valleys of\nSomersetshire. It must have been hard for a woman of culture like Hannah\nMore to be met by opposition, and in some cases fierce denunciation;\nharder still to be smiled at by those in high places, as a fanatic and a\nvisionary. But turning from the ugly, weather-worn stone, enclosed in\nhigh rusty railings, to the beautiful church, where what light there was\nyet in the sky, came through the many-coloured window lately erected to\nHannah More's memory, I thought, that as nothing that is good and\nbeautiful, coming from the Fountain of all beauty and all goodness, can\never die, so the light which Hannah More kindled in many humble hearts\nwas still shining in the eternal kingdom, where those that have lived as\nin the presence of the Son of God here, shine as the stars for ever in\ntheir Heavenly Father's realm.\nThat touch of Nature which makes the whole world kin brought the two\ngirls near to each other, as Joyce laid her hand upon Susan's, and said:\n\"I am very sorry for you; I shall not forget you;\" then added, looking\ndown on the prostrate form which Susan had so determinedly kept from\ndoing further mischief:",

Do tell me if\nthat man hurt you.\"\n\"He gave me a good shaking. What a giant he is! I felt as your Nip or\nPip might feel in Duke's clutches if he were angry.\"\n\"What a comfort we had not Charlotte with us, and that the boys had gone\non so far! I hope they will not be very anxious at home.\"\nThey made but slow progress. Joyce's usually swift, elastic steps were\nslow and faltering. She took several wrong paths, and they came once to\na steep dip in the heather, and were within a few inches of one of\nthose rocky pits which are frequent on the face of the level country\nabout Cheddar and the neighbouring district. Indeed Cheddar itself\nbegins with one of these small defiles, when entered from the top of the\nMendip, and the gradually increasing height of the rocks, and the\nwidening of the gorge as the road winds through it, is one of its most\nstriking features.\nJoyce was so wholly unaccustomed to feel tired and unnerved, that she\nsurprised herself, as well as Gilbert, by sitting down helplessly, and\nbursting into tears.\n\"Oh! we should have been killed if we had fallen down there. Won't you\nleave me, and go on to the shepherd's cottage? What can be the matter\nwith me?\" she said, sobbing hysterically.\nGilbert hardly knew whether distress at her condition, or delight in\nhaving her all to himself to comfort, predominated.\n\"Do not be frightened,' he said; we shall get on very well if you will\nlet me carry you.\"\n\"Oh! no, no,\" she said, trying to spring up with her accustomed energy.\n\"I will push on again.\"\nBut although she summoned all her courage, she was obliged to let\nGilbert put his arm round her and support her, and finally she was\nlifted in his strong arms and carried whether she wished it or not.\n\"I shall tire you so dreadfully,\" Joyce whispered.\n\"If you do, it is the sweetest tiredness I ever knew; you know that,\nJoyce.\"\nThen they went on in silence. Gilbert was still suffering from the\ntreatment he had received at Bob Priday's hands, and they made slow\nprogress.\n\"Just raise your head,\" he said, after ten minutes' tramp through the\nnarrow track, which he lost at times through the thick tangle of heath\nand gorse and low-growing bracken. \"Raise your head and tell me if you\ncan see the shepherd's cottage. It is getting very dark.\"\nJoyce did as he told her, but, after straining her eyes for a few\nmoments, she said:\n\"I can't see anything, it is so dark. I don't know where we are. Oh, I\ndon't know!\"\n\"You are safe with me,\" Gilbert said; and then added, fervently: \"I am\nnot afraid for God is with us.\"\nIt was so unusual for Joyce to hear that Name spoken. She did not\nrespond, but let her head fall upon his shoulder again.\nPresently he said:\n\"There is a tiny light now--two lights--they must be in the shepherd's\ncottage. Take heart, my darling. We shall soon be home.\"",

Why did you not keep up with the boys? They had been at home\nan hour before I started. What has happened sir?\" the squire said,\nturning a little sharply on Gilbert Arundel.\n\"It is too long a story to tell now, sir,\" Gilbert said. \"Miss Falconer\nand I fell into bad hands, and we may thank God nothing worse has\nhappened.\"\n\"Some of the miners, eh?\"\n\"One of them, sir, who is a host in himself; he blocked our way, and\nthreatened us; but I would rather not go over it all now. She is so\noverwrought, though she has been so splendidly brave.\"\n\"Oh! father, dearest dad! take me home,\" Joyce said. \"Is it far; is it\nfar?\"\n\"Some two miles, my Sunshine; but I can carry you. Now for it, be brave,\nmy sweet one, and we shall soon be home. Now, then, Sam and Thomas,\nmarch on.\"\n\"I think I can walk, father now,\" Joyce said; \"and here is Duke, dear\nDuke!\"\n\"Why, of course, I brought Duke. He is cleverer at finding his way than\nI am. He soon snuffed you out, good old fellow.\"\nThe two other men now turned towards home, with the big lanthorns in\ntheir hands, which served for guiding stars. Duke paced slowly between\nthe men, and his master and young mistress, and Gilbert brought up the\nrear.\nThe lights of the village were a welcome sight, and the hall door of\nFair Acres was open as they came up the road, showing a group of dark,\nexpectant figures, thrown out by the blaze of a wood fire.\n\"The mistress has lit a fire that we might have a welcome; that is like\nher wisdom,\" the squire said. \"A few tallow candles would not have been\nhalf as cheerful.\"\n\"Here we are; here we are!\" the squire called out; and then there was a\nrush of boyish feet, and a great chorus of rejoicing, and a host of\nquestions.\n\"We have been so anxious, _dying_ of anxiety,\" exclaimed Charlotte,\nthinking it necessary to begin to cry.\n\"What fools you were to walk over that rough, lonely country,\" Melville\nsaid. While Piers could only hover round Joyce, who, seated on a bench\nor old-fashioned settle by the side of the wide open hearth, held her\nmother in a tight embrace.\n\"The boys ought never to have left you,\" Piers said. \"How could Mr.\nArundel find the way?\"\n\"Joyce knew it,\" said Bunny. \"Joyce knew it. We have been over that\ntrack several times.\"\n\"Yes,\" echoed Harry, \"several times; only Joyce and Mr. Arundel were\ntalking so much, they never thought where they were going.\"\n\"'All's well that ends well,'\" said the squire. \"She had better go to\nbed, my dear; and this young gentleman looks white enough. You must get\nhim a good hot glass of negus; and I hope supper is ready; but take the\npoor child to bed first.\"\nMrs. Falconer had not said much beyond a few words in Joyce's ear, which\nno one else heard. Her usual vivacity and quick, sharp words seemed to\nhave suddenly failed her.\n\"Yes; I'll take her to bed, and there she will have to lie all\nto-morrow, I expect. It's the last time I'll allow her to separate from\nthe rest of us, when we are out on an excursion. Order the supper in,\nboys; and Melville, look after your friend; he is as white as a ghost;\nperhaps he has seen one!\"",

Clifton was at this\ntime gradually changing its position, or rather enlarging its borders!\nAt the close of the preceding century, or during the latter half of it,\nClifton Spa was the chief attraction. To these healing waters, as we\nknow by Mason's celebrated epitaph, a sorrowing husband brought his\nfading wife. Dowry Square and Dowry Parade, with their little quaint\npillars and balconies were in great request for invalids and visitors,\nfrom their near neighbourhood to the pump room.\nConsumptive patients might be seen slowly walking under the row of trees\nby the banks of the muddy Avon, and gazing across at the deep recesses\nof the Leigh Woods with wistful eyes. To the weak and the ailing\nNightingale Valley was then, though so near, very far off for them, and\nonly the robust and vigorous could cross the river by Rownham Ferry,\nand scale the wooded heights which at all times and in all seasons are\nso fair to look upon.\nBut at the time of which I write the tide of visitors was setting in\n_upwards_. The word \"relaxing\" was coming into fashion, and enterprising\nbuilders had raised, halfway up the hill, Windsor Terrace and the\nParagon, that circular range of houses which, entered from the level\nroad before Prince's Buildings, ends abruptly in a house which may\nindeed be said to \"be built upon a rock,\" the windows looking straight\ndown its precipitous sides.\nAlong the road which I have mentioned, which follows the course of the\nriver, though high above it, was erected 'Prince's Buildings;' the\n'first gentleman in Europe' during his long regency appears to have\nsupplied the names of many streets and terraces in this neighbourhood.\nCoronation Road beneath commemorates the auspicious event when Queen\nCaroline was shut out from her rights, and Prince's Buildings above was\nalso previously named in his honour. Crescents and terraces were quick\nto follow one another on the heights, and the glories of the Hot wells,\nand the salubrity of the waters, became things of the past.\nBracing air began to be the panacea for ailments, and the Clifton Downs,\nnow secured to the citizens of Bristol by the merchant venturers for\never, were sought by many who, a few years before, would have buried\nthemselves and their hopes of recovery under the shadow of the rocky\nheights, instead of facing the keen air upon their summit.\nThere was a medium preserved, however--Prince's Buildings, and the\nhouses built on the slope of Sion Hill, were sheltered at the back and\nfrom the front commanded a view of the Leigh Woods before them, and a\nshoulder of the great St. Vincent Rock to their right, which might well\nexcite the admiration of those who saw it for the first time.\nAfter Gilbert Arundel had stepped less briskly than sometimes up the\nsteep slope of Granby Hill, leaving the Crescent to his right, he passed\nalong the back of Prince's Buildings and up Sion Hill, where his mother\nhad taken up her temporary abode.",

But, Gilbert, you\ndo not look well; what is the matter?\"\n\"Nothing; I had a tussle with a Somersetshire miner last evening, and\nfeel as if I had got the worst of it to-day. What a lovely view you have\nfrom the window!\"\nThe young lady who had spoken to him on the balcony now stepped into the\nroom.\n\"Well, Gilbert, Aunt Annabella and I had quite given you up. My dear\ncousin, you look very lugubrious.\"\n\"Do I?\" Gilbert replied. \"A head-ache is a lugubrious thing; and how are\nyou, Gratian?\"\n\"Pretty well. I have been rather out of sorts; but I shall soon recover,\nnow you are come.\"\n\"That is a very pretty speech, Gratian, only I can't quite believe it.\"\n\"Well, I am going to take a walk abroad now, and leave you and your\nmother to have a chat together, all about Fairy Acre, or Fair Acre;\nwhich is it? I am very stupid; pray forgive me. Any commissions in the\nMall or Regent Street, Aunt Bella?\"\nMrs. Arundel, who had been getting her son some refreshment from one of\nthe deep cupboards by the fire place, and was anxious to administer a\nglass of wine, now turned towards her niece. \"No. Are you going alone,\nGratian?\"\n\"Yes, I am starting alone; I don't mean to fall over the rocks.\nGood-bye.\"\nGratian Anson was long past her _premi\u00e8re jeunesse_, and had never been\nactually pretty; but she was one of those women who exercise an\nextraordinary fascination apparently without any effort, and have their\nprey in their net, before there is any suspicion that the net is spread.\nGratian dressed fashionably, and one of her perfections was a tall and\nwell-proportioned figure. We might not, now-a-days, think it was set off\nby her short and full-flounced muslin gown, made with a short waist,\nthe body cut low, while over it she wore an enormous pelerine of muslin,\nedged with lace, which was crossed ever her breast and fastened with a\ncurious antique brooch.\nEven Gratian's tall figure could scarcely bear gracefully the width\nwhich fashion had decreed; and all was surmounted by a hat with a\nsugar-loaf crown, and a deep brim caught up on the left side by a large\nred rosette.\nAs she drew on her long, loose gloves, she surveyed her cousin with an\nappraising, searching glance. Her eyes were at all times too keen, and\nher wide mouth displayed a row of white teeth more fully than was quite\nagreeable.\n\"Ah!\" she said, tapping Gilbert's shoulder; \"ah! he is in love. I have\nno doubt of it! _Adieu; au revoir, cher cousin!_\"\n\"The same as ever!\" Gilbert said. \"Thank you, dear mother,\" he said,\nrising with his accustomed courtesy to take the glass of wine from her\nhand. \"Thanks. I confess I am rather knocked up; and if I had known Sion\nHill was so far from the Bristol coach office I should have come up in a\nhackney, I think, instead of sending my luggage by the carrier. But how\nbeautiful this is!\" he said, stepping on the balcony and looking out\nupon the scene before him.\nNo piers had yet been raised for the great design of the Suspension\nBridge--that vast dream of Brunel's, which for so many years seemed\nfated to remain only a dream; while the naked buttresses, in all their\nhuge proportions, stood like giants on either side of the gorge,\nconnected only by a rod of iron, over which a few people with strong\nnerves were allowed to pass in a sliding basket.\nGilbert looked out on a scene which can hardly be equalled for the\nunusual beauty of its salient points.\n\"We shall be happy to live here, mother,\" Gilbert said.\n\"You have no misgivings, my dear son.\"\n\"No, it is clear I must make my living in some practical way, and why\nnot by the law?\"\n\"There is the drudgery of the office first, and then the passing of\nexaminations.\"\n\"I have weighed all the pros and cons with you before; why do you go\nover them again?\" This was said in an irritable tone.\n\"I would as soon be a man of law as anything; and I want to make a\nhome\"--he paused--\"for _you_, and for one whom I have found under the\nMendips.\"\nHis mother had seated herself by his side, on a bench which stood in the\nverandah or balcony.\n\"It can't be thought of yet,\" he said; \"she is Falconer's sister! He\nnever told me he had a sister, or, rather, I should say, _such_ a\nsister. How should he be able to see what she is? I don't want to talk\nsentiment, mother, but I will say I did not know how beautiful and\nsimple hearted she was, and how her beauty was supreme with no fine\ndress, till I saw Gratian just now.\"\nHis mother laid her hand on his. \"What is her name, Gilbert?\"\n\"Joyce: it suits her as no other name could. Joyce!\" he repeated. \"Joy,\nSunshine, Birdie; they call her all these names at Fair Acres. Some day,\nwhen we are settled at Bristol, will you ask her to visit you, mother?\nand when you see her you will love her.\"\n\"I shall love her for your sake,\" his mother said, gently.",

Afterwards they began to speak of Melville, and all the\npast, in which Gilbert had borne such a noble part.\n\"I have separated him from Maythorne, and at least that is a step in the\nright direction; but he is so weak. How he came to be her brother, I\ncan't imagine; he is crazed on the subject of titles, and will roll off\na list of intimate friends, when he thinks I am not listening, to whom\nhe never spoke ten words in his life. I dined at the palace, and the\nbishop sent you his love, and so did his son, who lives with him--two\ncourteous gentlemen, with well-turned compliments at their tongue's end.\nThe bishop said I was like you, and that I had followed in the lines of\none of the most beautiful women he ever met.\"\n\"What bare-faced flattery!\" Mrs. Arundel said, laughing. \"I never was a\nbeauty. Your good looks come from the other side of the house.\"\n\"Who is flattering now?\" Gilbert asked; \"but seriously, mother, you\nshall accept an invitation to the Wells Palace, you must promise to do\nso. The bishop said something about November, if you did not mind the\nfalling leaves.\"\n\"I shall wait till I am asked,\" Mrs. Arundel said. \"If his lordship has\nburied me in the dust of years--out of sight and out of mind--I don't\nsee why he should unearth me now.\"\n\"And yet you sent your son to call you to mind; now that is unfair,\nmother. You urged me to go to the Palace at Wells, and now you won't\ntake advantage of what is growing out of it. But to go back to Falconer;\na stout, middle-aged gentleman, of small means and weak chest, wants to\ntravel for a year. The bishop suggested Mr. Falconer should give him his\nson to lead about, as he had previously washed several black sheep to a\nvery fair whiteness, paying expenses, but no further remuneration. If\nMelville can be got off under such auspices, it will be a grand step in\nthe right direction. Poor fellow! he has got into his head the absolute\nnecessity of seeing the world, and I, who know him pretty well, think\nthat there would be less danger of mischief if he were allowed to follow\nhis bent, than if he were to be forced to follow the pursuits of a\ncountry life at Fair Acres, which he thinks it grand to despise. He\ntalks with amazing coolness of all he shall do when he _does_ come, and\ntill he has learned a lesson, he would be a frightful nuisance to them\nall. The airs he gives himself to the poor old steward are preposterous;\nbut the worst thing about him is the way he speaks to his mother.\"\n\"What is she like?\"\n\"She is a very good woman, rather priding herself on setting aside all\nconventionality, and bustling about the house, and keeping everyone up\nto their duty but her son! Is it not extraordinary? She has ruined him\nwith stupid indulgence, and yet she is strict enough with the rest--even\nwith----\"\n\"Joyce!\" His mother supplied the word with a smile.\n\"Yes, even with Joyce,\" he rejoined; but starting up, with an\nexclamation of dismay:\n\"Did you know Maythorne was in Clifton, mother?\"\nMrs. Arundel followed the direction of her son's eyes, and there on the\nbroken, uneven slopes which lay before Sion Hill, came Gratian, chatting\ngaily to a man of some six-and-thirty or forty, who answered very well\nto the description a poet gave some years after of \"the dandy despot,\nthe jewelled mass of millinery, oiled and curled, and smelling of musk\nand insolence.\"\n\"I am very sorry he has come to Clifton,\" Mrs. Arundel said quickly. \"I\nsuppose he is at the hotel.\"\n\"Gratian looks satisfied. I hope I shan't get very savage with him,\nmother. When we last parted it was the night when I--but I need not talk\nabout it--he got that weak, foolish boy into his hands, and I helped to\nget him out, so he bears me a grudge.\"\n\"Never mind that, my dear son; and, Gilbert, remember an old watchword:\n'He that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city.'\"\n\"I know I do flare out at Maythorne sometimes; but then was there not a\ncause?\"\n\"Ah! Gilbert, there is never a cause or an excuse for wrath indulged;\nindignation against _wrong_ is one thing, rage against the wrong-doer\nanother.\"\nAnd now steps were heard in the hall, and Gratian's laugh. She threw\nopen the door and said in a half-mocking tone:\n\"My Lord Maythorne.\"\nMrs. Arundel advanced to meet her brother, and greeted him kindly, but\nwith no profession of extreme delight.\n\"Well, my dear sister,\" Lord Maythorne said, \"I have taken Clifton _en\nroute_ to Plymouth, and wandering aimlessly on the Downs I met your fair\nvisitor, my kinswoman, Gratian. What a quaint little snuggery you have\ngot, Annabella, upon my word; and Gratian tells me my hopeful nephew is\nhere, looking after his future prospects, eh? A little Methodism mixed\nwith law, eh?\" And Lord Maythorne produced an elegant gold snuff-box,\ntapped the lid, and took a delicate pinch between his forefinger and\nthumb, in the most approved fashion of the time.\n\"Ha! Gilbert, how do? Where is your cub, that you were leading about\nwith such good intentions. Have you brought him to introduce to your\nmother, eh?\" Waiting for no answer, and just touching Gilbert's hand\nwith his finger tips, he went on:\n\"Have you dined, Annabella?\"\n\"Long ago; we keep early hours.\"\n\"Well then, I'll return to my hotel to dine, and Gilbert shall accompany\nme.\"\n\"No thank you,\" Gilbert said, \"I shall sup with my mother, and go early\nto bed.\"\n\"You had better accept the invitation, Gilbert. Our supper will not be\nvery recherch\u00e9,\" Gratian said; \"we do not sit down to a royal feast\nhere, we live above such vanities.\"\n\"I dare say he will not be fastidious after his farmhouse life,\" said\nLord Maythorne, scornfully. \"How was your charge; is he walking without\nleading strings yet?\"\nGilbert bit his lip and struggled for composure; but his mother watched\nhim anxiously. Lord Maythorne's irony was hard for her to bear\nsometimes, and she never knew how Gilbert would take it.\n\"My dear boy, there is a wise proverb which in English sounds a little\nharsh, scarcely courteous; in French it is less abrupt: _'Chargez de vos\naffaires.'_ There are other renderings: 'Don't put your fingers into\nother people's pies.'\"\nPoor Gilbert sprang forward and raising his voice said:\n\"I will not submit to your impertinence. What right have you to treat me\nlike this? I saw you, a man almost double my age--\"\n\"Gently, gently my dear boy, not _double_; nay, nay--\"\n\"I say, I saw you trying to ruin a poor, weak fellow, who, weak as he\nwas, trusted you, and I tried to save him. I wonder you are not ashamed\nto speak thus; you are--\"\nThe fierce torrent of angry words suddenly stopped. His mother laid her\nhand upon his arm, and with a great effort he regained his composure.\n\"I beg your pardon, mother, for brawling here, in your presence, and in\nyours, Gratian, also; it is very unseemly.\"\nA mocking laugh from Lord Maythorne was his only response, and Gratian\nleft the room saying:\n\"Adieu! I hope to find you in a better temper at supper, Gilbert,\" which\nwas scarcely less irritating.\nGilbert followed her, and left his mother and her brother together.",

      "text": "Lord Maythorne was an utterly selfish man of the world; he was the son\nof his father's second marriage, and therefore much younger than Mrs.\nArundel. He was of the type very common in those days, of an openly\navowed scoffer at all that was good. Handsome, and with gentleman-like\nmanners when it suited him, he was unscrupulous as to truth, and could\nsend the shafts of his satire, dipped in gall, with a smiling face of\nindifference. He took a strange pleasure in entrapping the weak and the\nfoolish, and as we know, poor Melville Falconer had not escaped.\nGilbert had been roused to indignation against his uncle, and pity for\nhis victim, and he had done his best to open Melville's eyes, and had\nnot altogether failed.\nThe straightforward manliness of Gilbert had an attraction for many\nbesides Melville, and without any pretension or assumption of\nsuperiority, or many words about religion, he showed the Power that was\nin him was sufficient for him. His hot temper was governed, and a\ntorrent of angry words was often checked; while he did his best to\ntrample out the dislike it was impossible not to feel for his uncle.\nWhen Mrs. Arundel was left alone with her brother, he threw himself\ncarelessly on a sofa, and again drew out his snuff-box.\n\"So you have quite decided on the law for that boy,\" he said.\n\"Yes; this seems a good beginning here, and I have been able to article\nhim to a most respectable firm of solicitors.\"\n\"They are a dirty lot generally; however, I am glad that young fellow is\nreally going to earn his living, and make his own way in the world. It\nwould be a pity if he trusted to us.\"\n\"It is very unlikely he would trust to you,\" Mrs. Arundel said.\n\"It would be leaning on a broken reed, you think; well, I will not\ncontradict you, Annabella. In fact, I am a little short of cash, ready\ncash, just now. I suppose you do not happen to have a hundred pounds you\ndon't know what to do with?\"\n\"Certainly not; I cannot imagine, Maythorne, how you can think of such a\nthing.\"\n\"Well, I know you send a lot to convert the niggers and Hindoos, and\nthat you subscribe to a society for the flinging about of Bibles, which\nno one reads.\"\n\"Stop, please, Maythorne; I could not listen to any more conversation\nlike this; I will not take part in it. I can lend you no money; but once\nmore, for our father's sake, I cannot help begging, entreating you to\nturn from the ways of sin.\"\n\"No cant, please, Annabella; it makes me savage, and I don't want to\naffront you.\"\n\"I do not care whether you are affronted or not,\" Mrs. Arundel said,\nearnestly. \"I cannot help feeling that we are of the same blood, and\nthat if you were a worthy successor of my father you might be a joy and\nsupport to me. Instead of this, I have to try to keep my son from your\ninfluence, and dread that even by hearing your irreverent way of\ntreating sacred things, he may grow accustomed to what is wrong. Oh! it\nis not too late; you are still a young man, still in your prime; let me\nentreat you to break off the chains which bind you, or rather, turn to\nGod to free you from the bondage of sin--the _slavery_ of sin--for it is\nslavery, Maythorne.\"\n\"I am very much obliged to you, Annabella, for your kindly interest, but\nI rather prefer deeds to words. Maythornes is pretty well stripped of\ntrees now, and I have all but exhausted the possibility of raising money\non it; but _laisser aller_ is my motto, and I am not the one to mourn\nover a dark, old-fashioned house, and lands which yield no produce; if\npossible, I shall cut the whole concern. Well, ta-ta, till to-morrow. I\nhave promised to hire horses and trot out Gratian over the Downs.\"\nMrs. Arundel felt that to say anything more would be worse than useless,\nand yet, as she watched her brother lounge across the road and stand on\nthe slope looking over the river, her eyes filled with tears.\n\"To think what he _might_ have been. May God guard my boy from men like\nhim.\"\nGilbert had gone quickly away from Sion Hill, and found himself on the\nlower Downs--then not skirted by handsome houses, but with glades and\ngrassy slopes covered with hawthorn bushes, whitened in May-time with\nblossoms like snow, and covered in autumn with feathery masses of the\nwild clematis, or traveller's joy.\nGilbert found the place suited his mood, and he gave himself up to\nthoughts of Joyce, and forgot the late encounter with his uncle.\nHow delightful it was to build castles for the future--to think of a\nhome near all this loveliness, where Joyce would reign in all her sweet\nbeauty as his wife. The time had been when Gilbert had admired his\ncousin Gratian Anson, who was the daughter of his mother's aunt, and\ntherefore his cousin only in the second degree. Now her free, bold\nbearing, her ringing voice, her fashionable dress and banter, jarred on\nhim. Her laugh was like the rattle of a noisy brook over innumerable\nstones, when compared to Joyce's musical ripple, which was so real, and\nso entirely the outcome of her own happiness. Then how charming was her\nunconsciousness, and how her beauty was enhanced by the absence of all\naffectation; how pretty was her affection for her father and Piers, and\nhow gracefully and simply she did all the little household duties which\nher mother expected from her! Some words of a favourite poet of his\nmother's recurred to him, as he pictured Joyce in her little, short,\nlilac frock, with an apron, as he had seen her one morning, and her\nround white arms bare, as she came out of the dairy, and said she had\nmade up twenty pats of butter while he had been asleep. Surely George\nHerbert's words were verified.\nThe action was made fine by the spirit, which was done as a loving token\nof obedience to the will of another.\n\"Mother wished me to do it, so I got up an hour earlier,\" she had said,\nas she cut a slice from one of the rolls made for breakfast and offered\nit to him, spread with the butter she had made, with a cup of milk,\nbefore it had been skimmed.\nDreams of first love are very sweet; and Gilbert wondered if he had been\nwise to leave Fair Acres without getting a definite answer from Joyce\nherself.\nHonourable and straightforward, he determined not to return to Fair\nAcres unless prepared to ask her father's permission to lay all he had\nat her feet.

I wish to be your friend, as I have\nalways been, Gilbert. I was very sorry for you when you were so\nshamefully teazed by your young uncle; he does not like to be called\n_old_. I hope you noticed that.\"\n\"Oh! it is over now. I had no right to get into a rage.\"\n\"I think you had every right,\" Gratian said. \"He is too provoking;\nworse, since he has been so much in London, and welcomed, so we hear, by\nsome boon companions of His Majesty. But do not let us talk of him; let\nus talk of you. No; I don't choose to walk so near the edge of the\nrocks, if you do. Tell me about the people where you have been;--tell me\nabout the place. Is it a fine house, or a nice big farm? Fair Acres is a\npretty name, and are there no fair maidens as well as acres? Come,\nGilbert, you were not always so cross to me.\" This was said with a\ngentle pressure on his arm.\n\"I don't mean to be cross; but there is nothing at Fair Acres that would\ninterest you. You know about poor Melville already.\"\n\"I have heard of him,\" she said, \"and of your taking upon yourself to\nreform him. Well, who are the others?\"\n\"There are two fine boys, who want to be sailors, but they are too old,\nI am afraid, for the navy; they are thirteen.\"\n\"They--both thirteen!\"\n\"Yes, they are twins. Then there is a lame boy, Piers, a year younger.\nAnd oh, I forgot! a quiet, silent fellow, Ralph, he is sixteen.\"\n\"And does the great Melville, come next to him?\"\n\"Two little girls died. But there is a daughter of seventeen.\"\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Gratian; \"I knew there was a daughter. Did I not tell\nyou I knew you were in love? Tell me her name. Come! We are such old\nfriends. Surely you might tell me.\"\n\"Really, Gratian, I will tell you Miss Falconer's name if you so\nparticularly wish to hear it. I--\"\n\"I will guess it. Let me see. I love my love with an A, because she is\namiable, and I took her to the sign of the Archer, and fed her with\napples, and her name is Angela. Not right? Well, I will go through the\nalphabet, and I must surely be right at last. I love my love with a\nB----.\"\n\"Pray stop,\" Gilbert said. \"I don't feel in a jesting mood, somehow.\"\n\"Not ready to wear a cap and bells? Poor Gilbert. You feel more like\nsitting under a willow tree and singing 'Poor Mary Anne.'\"\n\"Which is our house?\" Gilbert asked.\n\"Not that one; not up the steps. But you shall not go in till you tell\nme her name.\"\n\"She is called Joyce,\" Gilbert said, in despair.\n\"Ah! then you allow there is only one _she_ for you in all the world,\nand _she_ is called Joyce.\"\n\"Now, I do hope you are satisfied,\" Gilbert said.\nShe laughed that loud, ringing laugh, as she ran upstairs before him.\n\"Oh! of course I am satisfied,\" she said.\n[Illustration]",

Really, Arthur, when one considers how much\nanxiety he has caused, I wonder you should say that.\"\n\"Ah! Letitia, that is all very well; but mothers' hearts are the same,\nwhether their sons are good or bad. It seems to me that mothers\ngenerally love the children best, that give them the most trouble.\nHowever, the poor fellow is gone, bag and baggage. I went to Bath with\nhim, and delivered him over to Mr. Crawford, a steady-going man he\nseems, and Melville will not have a chance of getting into mischief\nunder his care, I hope. But it is an expensive matter. I had to put a\nhundred pounds into Crawford's keeping as a start; besides twenty I gave\nMelville.\"\n\"You ought not to have given him more than five pounds,\" Miss Falconer\nsaid. \"The whole management of Melville has been a mistake.\"\n\"So you have told me before,\" said the squire. \"My dear Letitia, single\nwomen always think they know a great deal about the affairs of married\npeople, and, as experience is wanting, they commonly know nothing.\"\n\"I have long since given up arguing the point with you, Arthur; however,\nlet us say no more. I only hope that Melville may return a changed\ncharacter, and then you will not regret this outlay for him. I only wish\nJoyce had some of the money spent on _her_.\"\n\"Joyce!\" the squire exclaimed--a smile breaking over his fine face;\n\"Joyce! all the money in the world could not improve her. She is my joy\nand comfort. I half grudge letting her go to Barley Wood, even for a\nshort visit.\"\n\"You ought to be glad that she has had such an invitation; and, really,\nyou have to thank me for it, Arthur. I take such a deep interest in\nJoyce. I have often tried to put before you what she needs, and now I\nhave great hope that Mrs. More may suggest some plan for her.\"\nThe squire began to feel very impatient; his sister's interest in his\nchildren was undoubted, but he did not want to have it perpetually\nbrought before him. Miss Falconer had an unfortunate habit of sounding\nher own excellencies, especially with regard to her nieces and nephews.\nThen there were often little side hits at his wife; and it is always\nhard for a man like the squire, to be reminded that his sisters do not\nconsider his wife their equal in the social scale, and the nearer the\ntruth the less palatable is the assertion of it.\n\"Is not Charlotte ready?\" he exclaimed. \"Joyce will be waiting at\nDraycot, where we are to pick her up. Thomas was to drive her there with\nher box, as he had an errand at Farmer Scott's.\"\n\"In what did Joyce drive?\"\n\"In the gig; and Joyce likes to pay Mrs. Scott, who is a sad cripple, a\nvisit sometimes, so it all fitted in very well. Come Charlotte, my\ndear,\" he said, turning to his niece. \"We shall find the four-wheel at\nthe 'Swan,' and I've the ostler at the Close gate waiting to take your\nluggage. Two boxes! Joyce only took one.\"\n\"Charlotte was obliged to have a bonnet-box,\" her aunt said. \"Her\nTuscan bonnet would have been ruined with the dust if she had worn it.\"\nThe squire was already in the little lobby, and, cutting short\ngood-byes, he strode down the Close, while Charlotte ran back twice, to\nkiss her aunt and say in a tearful voice:\n\"I cannot endure to leave you, sweet auntie.\"\n\"Good-bye, my treasure, good-bye,\" Miss Falconer repeated again and\nagain, and very genuine tears were on her own cheeks. They were a very\ndemonstrative pair, and, as we should say in these days, \"gushed\" over\neach other, but real love did underlie the fanciful expression of it;\nand Miss Falconer looked on Charlotte with the pride that a modeller in\nplastic clay, looks upon the work of his hands, and remembers how\ncarefully every detail has been wrought out, and how, in spite of a\nlittle flaw here and there, the result is satisfactory.\nJoyce was watching for her father at the door of Mr. Scott's farm, and\ncame running down the garden between the lavender bushes and high\nshrub-fuschias, which were glowing scarlet in the sunshine.\nThe squire waved his hand to the farmer's wife, who, crippled with\nrheumatism, could not leave her seat in the porch to come towards him. A\nfarmboy lifted Joyce's box to the back seat, where she soon mounted\nwith a quick, alert spring, and then, with a shilling handed to the boy,\nthe squire drove off.",

It is a good many\nmiles for Mavis at a stretch.\"\nThey drew up at the door, and an old servant answered the ringing of the\nbell, which Joyce had jumped down to pull by a handle, made of a deer's\nfoot. The servant's face was not very pleasant, and a forbidding looking\nwoman called out:\n\"Company! yes, there's nothing but company. There's no rest from it.\"\nThe boxes were taken down, and the squire, unwilling to prolong the\nparting, which he felt more keenly than he cared to own, waved his whip,\nand saying \"Good bye, my Sunshine, good-bye,\" drove off.\n\"This way,\" the woman said, passing across the hall and opening the door\nof a low, pretty room, sweet with that scent of rose leaves and\nlavender, which always belonged to the atmosphere of a country house\nlong ago. It was an aroma in which many scents blended, with no very\ngreat strength--a fragrance which dwells in the memory amongst the\npleasant things of early days.\nThere was nothing very striking about Barley Wood; it was simply a\npretty country residence--a place to live and die in. There was an air\nof tranquility about it, and an absence of anything like fashion or\nshow, which was very refreshing.\nMiss Frowde rose to greet the two girls, and, saying that Mrs. More\nwould see them after dinner, she led them to two rooms at the back of\nthe house, near the servants' quarters.\n\"The house will be full next week for the Bible meeting at Wrington, so\nwe thought you would not object to these rooms. I hope you will be\ncomfortable.\"\nThe rooms opened out of each other, and were very plain in their\nfurniture. Joyce, accustomed to her mother's scrupulous care about every\nlittle detail, noticed that the counterpane on her bed was a good deal\nrumpled, and there were rims of dust on the bosses of the old-fashioned\nround mirror. Evidently the servants at Barley Wood had not taken much\ntrouble about the guests.\nIndeed, the shameful neglect of Mrs. More's servants, and their bad\nconduct, had even then been canvassed by outsiders, though the old lady\nherself was perfectly unconscious of it.\nThe ingratitude of her servants, whom she had spoiled with such\nexcessive indulgence, was a dark cloud over Hannah More's last days, and\nsent her forth at last, with all the weight of her years upon her, to\nseek a new home, and turn her back on Barley Wood for ever.",

She has led a very retired life\nat Fair Acres.\"\n\"There are many flowers that bloom unseen, and she is one of the fairest\nI ever saw. If a retired life produces such good effect, it strikes me,\nMrs. More, we had all better go into retirement. But--\"\nHe stopped, for Joyce, with a white face from which every vestige of\ncolour had vanished, came back to her position by Mrs. More's chair.

Trust in Him, and to\nHis loving kindness I commend you.\"\nJoyce raised herself from the old lady's arms, and the Bishop, deeply\nmoved, laid his hand upon her head.\n\"The Lord bless you and keep you, my child, now and evermore.\"\nJoyce did not weep or make any outward sign of great distress.

Go to daddy; welcome, daddy!\"\nAh! how often had Joyce watched for her father at the gate! How her\nheart had thrilled with joy as she ran to meet him; and now!\nA low cry escaped her, which made Thomas turn his head, which he had\nhitherto kept steadily to the front, as if everything depended on his\nstaring straight between the ears of the horse, and never looking to the\nright hand, or the left.\nThomas was a hard featured man, who had served the old squire, and to\nwhom Mr. Falconer was still \"Master Arthur.\" \"Doan't ee fret, my dear\nMiss Joyce.

Duke, Duke, where is he?\"\nAs if he understood her human speech--as, indeed, he did, Duke turned to\nprecede her upstairs.\nOn a bench in the long corridor two maid servants were seated, crying\nbitterly. But Joyce did not speak to them, she dared not; even the\nquestion she had asked Duke died on her lips.\nThe door of her father's room was ajar; and as Duke pushed it open with\nhis nose, Joyce could see the great four-post bed, her mother sitting by\nit, and curled up in the window-seat was Piers.\nThe friends who had been there in the early part of the day were gone;\nthey could do no more at Fair Acres. And Mr. Paget's aim was to set the\nconstables to work to find the man who must have hurled a sharp stone at\nMr. Falconer's head. The Wells doctor, too, was gone. He had a pressing\ncase near Wells upon his hands, but he was to return at eight o'clock,\nwhen, it was hoped the doctor greater than himself, who had been\nsummoned from Bristol, would have arrived.\nIn those days help in emergency was slow to obtain. Telegrams were not\ndreamed of, and horsepower performed the part which steam was soon to\ntake up; to be followed by the marvellous electric force, which now\nsends on the wings of the wind messages all over the world, multiplied,\non the very day on which I write, to an enormous extent, by the\nintroduction of sixpenny telegrams, which will send a call for help, or\nstrike a note of joy, and win an immediate response from thousands.\nBut there were no electric messages possible to get medical help for the\nsquire, nor, indeed, would any help avail.\nWith a great sigh, Duke resumed his watch at the foot of the high bed;\nand Joyce, crossing over, kissed her mother and Piers, and then gazed\ndown upon her father.\n\"Dear dad!\" she said, inadvertently using the familiar name.\n\"He has not spoken nor opened his eyes since we laid him here,\" Mrs.\nFalconer said. \"He knows no one--no one----\"\n\"Did he tell how it happened?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"It might have been that he was thrown from--from--Mavis.\"\n\"No,\" Mrs. Falconer said again, \"that could not be, they think; besides,\nthey found a heavy stick and a tinder box close by.\"\nPresently Piers came down from his place, and Joyce put her arms round\nhim. The boy was very calm, but great tears fell upon Joyce's hand as\nshe pressed him close.\nThe silent watch went on. Duke lay motionless, but his eyes were on the\nalert. The servants looked in sometimes, and brought Joyce and her\nmother some tea and cake. Joyce swallowed a cup of tea, but ate nothing.\nCould this be the evening of the day which dawned so brightly?--the\nWrington bells chiming, the village children singing hymns, joyousness\nand gladness everywhere. The guests gathered round Mrs. More; the\nbright, intelligent conversation to which she was listening; then her\nown narrative of the Mendip adventure;--and this brought her to the\npresent from the past!\nIf her father had been assailed by a malicious miner on Mendip, that\nassailant was Bob Priday; of this she felt no doubt.\nThe Bristol doctor came, and the Wells doctor and they held a\nconsultation. But there was nothing to be done; the injury Mr. Falconer\nhad received was mortal.\n\"Will he give no sign, no word that he knows us?\" Mrs. Falconer asked.\n\"Oh, for one word!\"\n\"We do not think there will be any return of consciousness,\" the doctors\nsaid, \"but we cannot tell.\"\nNo; no one could tell. And so the sad hours of the night passed, and the\ndawn broke over the familiar fields, and Fair Acres smiled in the first\nbright rays of the morning.\nPiers had slept curled up in his window-seat, worn out with grief. Mrs.\nFalconer, too, had slept in an upright position, her head resting\nagainst the back of the chair, sleeping for sorrow.\nBut Joyce did not sleep; she kept watch, hoping, praying for one word of\nfarewell.\nAs the first sunbeam slanted through the casement, her father opened his\neyes, and fastened them on Joyce. \"Sunshine,\" he said, with a faint\nsmile. \"Dear child.\"\n\"Dearest father, dear father!\"\n\"I hope my little girl will be named after my mother, _Joyce_. Yes, it\nis an old-world name, but I fancy it; name her Joyce.\"\nThe sound of his master's voice roused Duke, who pricked his ears and\ncame to the bedside. Mrs. Falconer also started and awoke.\n\"There is a word I cannot catch, about the _Life_. Try to think of it. I\ncan't.\"\nJoyce glanced at her mother.\n\"What does he mean?\" she said, helplessly. \"Oh! what does he want?\"\n\"The Life; I am the Life.\" The words came with difficulty now.\nThen Piers, starting up, said:\n\"I know. I think I know. 'Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the\n_Life_.'\"\nA smile of infinite content came over the father's face.\n\"_Yes_,\" he said. \"Yes, the Life.\"\nPresently he murmured Melville's name, and those of the children who had\ngone before.\n\"The little girls all died but _one_,\" he said. \"One is left--Sunshine.\"\nThey knelt down as in the presence of something unseen but near; for the\nshadows gathered on the fine face of the husband and father; and Piers\nrepeated for the second time:\n\"Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the Life!\"\nAs if with a great effort to repeat the words, the squire said, faintly,\n\"Jesus said,\"--then silence fell; and the next thing Joyce knew was\nthat she was lying in her own little bed, and that she was fatherless.",

The beautiful tie between father and daughter, which when it\nexists is one of the most beautiful in the world, seemed severed,\ncruelly severed, and Joyce was desolate. She was scarcely eighteen, and\nthe freshness and gladness of her life hitherto had been remarkable.\nNow, all unawares, the storm had swept over her sky, and, when it\npassed, left her lonely indeed.\nMrs. Falconer was one of those people who bury their dead out of sight,\nand cannot bear the mention of their names. Ralph, setting his face\nbravely to meet his duty, did not speak of his father as Joyce would\nhave loved to speak of him, and it was only to Piers, that Joyce could\nsometimes ease her burdened heart, by talking of her father. Just as on\nthe summer morning, now looking so far off, left in the golden haze of\njoy and glad young life, Joyce had seen her lame brother at the gate of\nthe plantation, so she saw him now.\nShe made a great effort to control her weeping, and said:\n\"It is very slippery on the turf to-day; wait, dear, and I will come\ndown to help you.\" But Piers said:\n\"I want _you_ to come down; I don't want to come up.\"\n\"Is anything the matter?\"\nPiers did not answer, and in another minute Joyce was at his side.\n\"Joyce, there is a woman hiding under the maples and brambles.\"\n\"A woman? Perhaps she is one of the women employed on the farm.\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Piers, \"I wish you would come and see who it is.\"\n\"Very well, dear,\" Joyce said; \"you are sure it is a _woman_?\"\n\"Yes, and she is crying and sobbing.\"\nJoyce followed Piers along the shrubbery path, now covered with a new\nlayer of fallen leaves, and, at the turn of a still narrower side path,\nshe saw, half hidden by the brambles and undergrowth, a woman; her head,\nbowed upon her hands, and her attitude one of despair.\nJoyce went near and said: \"What is the matter? Are you in pain? Can I\nhelp you?\"\nThe woman raised her head, and Joyce recognised at once that she was\nSusan Priday.\nThoughts of the night on Mendip; of the fierce onslaught made on Gilbert\nArundel by the big giant, and the almost certainty she felt, that the\ncruel blow aimed at her father was by the same hand, made Joyce start\nback and say, coldly:\n\"You had better not stay here, these are private grounds.\"\nPiers, who was leaning against the bole of a beech tree, said:\n\"Yes; get up and go away. I will show you the gate into the road.\"\n\"Lady,\" said the girl, passionately, \"I came to see _you_. I saw you\nsobbing and crying on the bench yonder, for I got into the plantation\nthat way. I heard you sob, and call 'Father,' and then my heart nearly\nbroke, and I came round at the back and got over the hedge. I felt as if\nI dare not speak to you. Do you know me, lady?\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said; \"of course I see who you are, but I--I cannot do\nanything for you, and we are all in great grief, very, very great\ngrief,\" Joyce said, with a sudden spasm of agony in her voice.\n\"I know it, I know it, that's why I came; and I'm in grief, too. Father\nis gone away, no one knows where; the boys have run off, and, oh! the\nbaby is dead. I did think I'd keep him, for mother's sake; but, in a\ndrunken fit, father threw a pot of boiling water at me. It missed me,\nand the baby caught it on his neck and face, and it scalded him\ndreadful. The school mistress was kind, and so was Mrs. Amos, she that\nowns the farm; but he died--he died--and I am all alone. Oh! Miss, oh!\ndear young lady, pity me.\"\n\"I do pity you,\" Joyce said. \"But where is your father? For you must be\naware that suspicion points to him as the cause of my--of my dear\nfather's death.\"\n\"Yes, I do know it. Oh! miss, forgive me, and let me come and serve\nyou. I want no wage; but I'd die for you, if that would do you good. I\nhave never forgot your face that night, nor how you spoke soft then\ninstead of angry. Oh, miss, let me come and live with you. I will sleep\non the ground. I'll do the work of two in the dairy, or in the house,\nand I want no wage. Poor mother always said God would take care of me,\nbut He has taken away the baby, He has, that is the cruellest part. And\nfather; oh! miss, you can't tell what it is to be filled with shame\nabout a father.\"\n\"No, indeed,\" Joyce said. \"No; I know what it is to be proud of one, and\nto----\" Her voice broke down, and Piers said:\n\"She ought to go away, Joyce; she can't be left here.\"\nBut Joyce seemed to be thinking for a few minutes. Here was a girl whose\nfather had, as everyone thought, been the cause of her father's death;\nhere was the daughter of this man, coming to her and begging to be taken\ninto the house, to be her servant? Was it possible?\nWith a discretion far beyond her years, Joyce said, \"I will make\ninquiries about you from the school mistress, and if I find you really\nbear a good character, I will get you a place, and----\"\n\"I want no place apart from _you_\" the girl said, passionately. \"If I\ncould die to undo my father's wicked deed, I would die, and,\" she added,\nsadly, \"it ain't much I have to live for now the baby's gone. But if you\nwon't take me, well, I'll tramp to Bristol; and if I can't get bread in\nan honest way, I must get it somehow else.\"\n\"No, no; don't say that. I must consider and think, and if I can take",

There is one for you--not from Italy though; it has\nthe Bristol post-mark, and is franked. There was an immense deal to pay\nfor Melville's.\"\nJoyce waited to hear no more, but went to her mother. She was sitting\nwith her son's letter open before her. It began, \"Dear father and\nmother,\" and these words went like a knife through Joyce's heart.\nMrs. Falconer sat day after day in the same chair by the fire-place. Her\nlarge widow's cap--in those days an immense erection of many thick\nfrillings, and with long \"weepers\" falling over her shoulders--altered\nher so entirely, scarcely any one would have recognised her.\nJoyce glanced through the letter. It was as self-sufficient and trifling\nas ever. Melville found foreign travel less delightful than he had\nexpected.\nThe diligence was then the universal mode of transit through France, and\nthe two travellers had taken a whole month to reach Hy\u00e8res, a journey\nwhich can now be got through in three days at the longest calculation.\nMelville complained of the food and the cramped diligence, and how the\nsmell of garlic made him sick; and how old Crawford was as \"stiff as\nstarch,\" and that he did not think he should stay away long.\nOf Genoa la Superba not a word, except to say that he had seen a fine\ncopy of one of Raphael's pictures for sale, which, if his father would\nsend the money, he would buy, for the dining hall at Fair Acres.\nJoyce had hardly patience to finish the letter; but her mother said:\n\"Give the letter to me, Joyce.\" And then she smoothed the thin sheet of\nforeign paper tenderly, and, refolding it, placed it in her large\nwork-box, which stood unused by her side.\nJoyce, meantime, opened the other letter, and a bright flush came over\nher face. She could not read it there; she put it into her deep pocket,\nand said:\n\"Dear mother, a poor girl is in the kitchen; she is utterly friendless\nand forlorn. May I let her sleep in the empty attic to-night, till I\nmake inquiries about her of the mistress of one of Mrs. More's schools\nto-morrow?\"\n\"You can do as you like, Joyce,\" was the reply, as poor Mrs. Falconer\nrelapsed into her usual condition of dreary silence, after kindling into\nsome interest about Melville's letter.\n\"You can do as you like--my day is over.\"\n\"Mother, dearest mother, do not say so; you will feel better soon. It\nis--it is the suddenness of the blow that has come upon you--and upon us\nall--that has stunned you. Do try to take comfort.\"\n\"Comfort, Joyce! You don't know what you are saying. I lived for your\nfather--and I have lost him. It was cruel, cruel to take him in his\nprime, to leave me desolate!\"\n\"You have got us children to love you, mother,\" Joyce ventured to say;\n\"and think how good Ralph is, giving up everything he cared for most, to\ntake up the business of the farm.\"\n\"As if he could do that,\" was the reply. \"Ralph is not fit for it.\"\n\"Mr. Watson says it is wonderful how he has fallen into the ways of\npeople on the estate. He has such a firm will and purpose in everything\nhe does.\"\nMrs. Falconer sighed.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I don't want to talk any more about it. I think if\nyou will get me the yarn I will go on knitting Harry's stockings.\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" Joyce said; \"and Piers will be so pleased to hold the skeins\nfor you, mother.\"\nThen she kissed her mother again and again, and whispered:\n\"You will come to church on Sunday, mother, won't you? It is so dull for\nyou, sitting here day after day.\"\n\"I can do nothing else,\" was the reply--\"nothing else. What else should\nI do? You are a dear, good child, Joyce. He always said so; he was\nalways right.\"\nThere is nothing harder to meet than a grief like poor Mrs. Falconer's;\nor rather, I should say, there is nothing harder to meet than a grief\nwhich refuses to recognise love in the midst of anguish which hardens\nand, as it were, paralyzes the whole being; changes the fountain of\nsweetness into bitterness; making the accustomed routine of duty\nimpossible and falling on the sufferer like a heavy pall.\n\"Missus is like somebody else; can't believe it is missus at all,\" the\nmaids said, when Joyce returned with the orders for poor Susan to remain\nall night, and to be cared for till the morning.\nThe poor girl was so utterly exhausted that she had fallen asleep, her\nface hidden on her arm, her elbows on the kitchen table; and her\nattitude of utter helplessness touched Joyce.\n\"Be kind to her,\" she said; \"she is very unhappy. Be kind to her, Sarah.\nI know you _will_ be kind to her as I wish it.\"\nThen Joyce ran to her room and took the letter from her pocket.\nThe evening was closing in fast, but kneeling on the window-seat, she\nopened the lattice, and all the daylight yet lingering in the west fell\nupon the clearly written page of Bath post paper.\nThe letter was dated: \"Sion Hill, Clifton, near Bristol,\" and began:\n\"If I have delayed sending you an expression of my sympathy in your\ntrouble, dear Miss Falconer, it has been that I feared to intrude\nupon you in your grief, and feared, too, that I should touch it\nwith too rough a hand. But I remember your parting words, your kind\npromise not to forget me. Thus I venture to tell you that I bear\nyou ever in my mind, and that the time may come, _will_ come, when\nI shall beg you to hear more from me than I can say now, and grant\nme a very earnest petition. But not now would I speak of myself or\nof my hopes and fears. Rather would I tell you how I pray God to\ncomfort you for the loss of a father, whom I count it an honour to\nhave known. I would ask you to believe that I, who have had the\nprivilege of watching the happy home-life--now, alas! so sadly\nbroken up--can, at least, understand what the wreck must be. Please\npresent my regards and sympathy to Mrs. Falconer, and assure her\nof my remembrance of her kindness to me while her guest at Fair\nAcres, if indeed you think I may venture so far.\n\"I remain, dear Miss Falconer,\n\"Your very faithful and true\n\"GILBERT DECOURCY ARUNDEL.\"\nThere was a postscript written on the blank part of the sheet of Bath\npost, which was folded over.\n\"My mother is likely to visit the Palace, at Wells, in November. I\nhave charged her, if possible, to see you at Fair Acres. I have\nheard nothing from your brother, but I am well satisfied that he is\nout of England, for reasons which you know.--G. DeC. A.\"",

Why, Mr. Dacres tells me that the last Dean used to\nassemble a large party on purpose to see the spectacle; I _must_ see\nit!\"\nThe gentle bishop seemed a little taken aback by Gratian's determination\nto have her own way.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I leave you in the hands of your guardian, Mrs.\nArundel, and you could not be in better keeping.\"\n\"Mr. Dacres, Mr. Law, you will take me.

The bell was chiming for service, and as Mr. Dacres\nambled across the grass, the Dean, preceded by his verger, was coming\nout of his gate to the cathedral. Unlike his predecessor, Dean Lukin,\nwho is reported to have made the bull-baiting a festal occasion at the\nDeanery, even inviting guests to be present at it, the Dean demurred a\nlittle at the bull passing under the Chain Gate at all, thus entering\nthe precincts of the cathedral.\n[Illustration: The Deanery Wells.]\n\"How do, Dacres, how do?\" the Dean said; \"the crowd is very orderly at\npresent.\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Dean, so far; the great proportion of people are in East\nWells. This young lady is a guest at the palace, and would like to see\nthe bull pass. Might I escort her and Lord--Lord Hawthorne to the\nterrace?\"\nThe Dean bowed rather stiffly. He would have thought better both of the\nyoung lady and her companion, if they had come to the service and joined\nin the thanksgiving for the happy deliverance of King James I. and the\nthree estates of England from the most traitorous and bloody-intended\nmassacre by gunpowder; and--looking on some years--as the inscription at\nthe head of the Form of Prayer also went on to say--\n\"For the happy arrival of His Majesty King William on this day, for the\ndeliverance of our church and nation.\"\n\"By all means, Mr. Dacres. I think in future I shall prohibit the\nprocession passing this way. It is scarcely seemly while service is\ngoing on within the cathedral walls.\"\nWith this the Dean passed on, and Gratian, laughing, said:\n\"The Dean is hardly as gracious as the Bishop. Let us stand here,\nbecause we shall get away sooner to the market-place after the bull has\npassed.\"\nMr. Dacres was rather glad to retrieve his character with the Dean, by\nhastening to the cathedral, after having placed Lord Maythorne and\nGratian, in a good place by the wall; and then, after some trial of\npatience, the sound of shouts and a brass band heralded the approach of\nthe bull.\nDecked with ribbons, and with his head well set forward, led by his\nkeepers by a ring passed through the nose, the bull stepped proudly on,\nfollowed by the dogs, all in charge of their respective owners.\nThere was always something pathetic in the sight of a huge animal\nbrought out, not to fight in a fair field, but to be worried almost to\ndeath by the onslaught of persistent dogs, all goaded on to make their\nattack, all backed by betting men, who had an interest in their success\nor failure.\nIn Pepys' celebrated 'Diary' there is a description of a bull-baiting to\nwhich he seems to have gone to divert his mind from the furious letter\nwhich a friend told him was on his way to him from Lord Peterborough,\nwhich letter seems to have preyed upon him more than the news recorded\non a previous page of three people in one house \"dead of the plague.\"\nThe bull-baiting, however, was pronounced, even by the sight-loving\nSamuel Pepys, as a \"very rude and very nasty pleasure.\"\nYet, more than a century and a half later, we find the usually quiet and\npeaceful city of Wells all agog to witness the bull-baiting in the\nmarket square.\nIt was as Lord Maythorne said; every window was engaged, and the\ntradespeople commanded high prices for the day.\nLadies in smart dresses, with gentlemen in attendance, were to be seen\nsitting at the old lattice bay windows, all along the line of houses in\nthe square.\nLord Maythorne had engaged places over the principal draper's shop,\nwhere Joyce and Charlotte had made their purchases, on the day of\nGilbert Arundel's arrival at Fair Acres.\nIt was with some difficulty that Lord Maythorne and Gratian made their\nway through the turnstile by Penniless Porch, and gained the door of the\nshop to the left, which was kept guarded by a stalwart son of the owner.\nIt was a good position, and if a bull-baiting were worth seeing, perhaps\non the principle of comparative value, the place was worth the five\nguineas which Lord Maythorne had paid for it.\nHis style and title being known, great respect was shown him and\nGratian, and the circular bay window was appropriated to them, while\nless distinguished people thought themselves honoured to take their\nposition behind them, further back in the room.\nThe space where the bull was baited was railed off, and the kennels for\nthe dogs prepared behind it.\nIt was some time before the bull could be got into position, and he\nshowed at first no signs of fight.\nPresently Gratian exclaimed:\n\"There is little Mr. Dacres elbowing through the crowd; I knew he was\ndying to come. Now he has said his prayers, I suppose he thinks he is\nfree to do so. And do look at that little woman in the yellow hood,\npushing and fighting to get a place on the window-sill of the house by\nPenniless Porch. What a crowd! Who could have believed so many people\nlived in Wells? There is seldom a creature to be seen. When we drove\nthrough the market-place the other day there was only an old woman by\nthe 'Cross,' selling potatoes.\"\n\"Ah! madam,\" exclaimed an old gentleman, who was standing behind\nGratian's chair, and heard her remark, \"the best days of the spectacle\nare over--quite over. Now, in Dean Lukin's time, I have known lords and\nladies and their suite present, and a really genteel crowd assembled,\ninstead of the riff-raff of to-day.\" The old man sighed, and taking a\npinch of snuff from his tortoiseshell snuff-box, handed it to Lord\nMaythorne. \"The bull-baiting at Wells, sir, was sought after by the\n_\u00e9lite_ of the county and neighbourhood. Why, sir, I have seen coaches\nwith four horses come in from Bath full of lords and ladies and great\nfolks. But the times are changing--the times are changing! And, sir,\nwhen a Bishop and a Dean are 'loo warm' about a great spectacle, we\ncan't expect others to be hot!--eh?\"\nLord Maythorne laughed cynically; and the old man, a veteran of Wells,\nwhose memory went back to at least sixty fifths of Novembers, felt his\nsleeve sharply pulled by the master of the shop.\n\"Have a care--have a care what you say, Mr. Harte. Don't be so free; you\nare talking to a real lord, who is visiting at the palace.\"\nThe poor old man was fairly silenced by the news; he retired to a remote\ncorner, trembling and abashed, and the glory of the bull-baiting was\nover for him.\n\"A real lord!\" he murmured, \"and I've been talking to him as if he were\njust nobody. Dear, _dear_--_dear me_!\"\nThe sport began in good earnest about one o'clock. The backers pricked\nup the dogs to the onslaught, and cries and shouts resounded.\nThe bull, at first strangely stoical and unmoved, with its large brown\neyes staring calmly at the yelping, bounding dogs, was at length lashed\nto fury. With a loud and angry bellow he tossed his assailants hither\nand thither, and again and again the mangled bodies of the dogs were\nhurled by the horns of the bull outside the barriers amongst the\nshrieking crowd.\nAt last, after a pause, while the bull stood, covered with blood and\nfoam, watching for the attack of the next adversary, a brindled terrier,\nafter receiving some cruel thrusts from the tortured animal, sprang with\nunerring aim at its throat, and clung there with such a desperate grip,\nthat its giant strength, exhausted by the long conflict, gave way. The\nbull rolled over on his side with a roar of agony, and the victorious\ndog, with his eyes starting out of his head, and his tongue lolling out\nof his mouth, was borne off by his backer, amidst the cheers and\nacclamations of the excited crowd.",

A party from the\npalace went forth about eight o'clock to see the illumination of the\nbonfire, gaining easy access to the offices of the Bishop's secretary,\nwhich were situated between the two gateways, one called Penniless\nPorch, the other the Palace Eye, both at the top of the market square.\nThose who had turned away with disgust from the bull-fight, yet felt it\nalmost their duty to be present at the great Protestant demonstration of\nfire and burning. So that the windows of the office were filled by the\npalace party, amongst whom were members of the Bishop's family.\n[Illustration: Penniless Porch, Wells.]\nIt was indeed a sight never to be forgotten when the huge bonfire was\nlighted, and the flames leaped up to the sky. The quaint old houses in\nthe market square were illuminated with a ruddy glow, and the cathedral\ntowers caught the fitful radiance, and stood up against the murky\nNovember sky with a flush of crimson on their hoary heads. The shouting\nand the tumult reached its height when Guy Fawkes' great effigy fell\ninto the burning mass, and cries of \"No Popery!\" \"Down with the\nCatholics!\" were taken up, by every little screaming urchin, who, with\nburned fingers and scorched cheeks, thought he was doing good service to\nsome cause, though, if he and half that seething crowd had been\nquestioned as to why they came together, the \"more part,\" as in times of\nold, could not have given an answer.\nA great wrong once done, which fastens on the mind of a nation, and is\nhanded down as a subject of everlasting indignation from generation to\ngeneration, must be expected to demand outward demonstration. Thus the\nfires of Smithfield, and the secret plot of the conspirators beneath the\nhall at Westminster, have never been forgotten.\nThe people still hunger for some expression of their wrath, and do not\nwait to ask if that expression takes a wholesome form.\nAlthough like demonstrations have been very much moderated of late\nyears, and nearly stopped altogether by the authorities in Wells, still\nthere is yet a city of the West whose motto is \"Ever faithful,\" where\nthe same scene is acted even on a larger scale; and woe to the unhappy\nman who may have incurred the displeasure of the good people of Exeter\nduring the current year. His effigy is still paraded through the\nstreets, followed by mummers in gay attire, and, amidst general\nexecrations, his image tumbles down into the fiery furnace, as a meet\ncompanion for that, of the never-to-be-forgotten Guy Fawkes.",

      "text": "As these thoughts were passing through her mind, she was tying up some\nbranches of a pink China rose which grew against the porch.\n\"Give me another bit of cloth and a nail, Piers,\" she called to her\nbrother.\nThe tap of Piers' crutches was heard in the hall as he went to do her\nbidding.\nAs she stood in the sunshine, with her arm raised to secure the truant\nbranch of the trailing rose, waiting for her brother to bring the nail,\na figure cast a shadow against the porch, and, turning her head, she saw\na gentleman standing near her. Instantly she dropped the branch, and,\nwith a bright colour in her cheek, waited till the stranger spoke.\n\"Miss Falconer, I think?\" he said, his eyes fastening upon her fair\nyoung face.\n\"Yes,\" she said, simply. \"Do you want to see my mother?\"\n\"Nay,\" he said, \"I came to see _you_. I have heard much of you; I am\nyour brother's friend.\"\nJoyce looked inquiringly at her visitor, and said, with a little quiver\nin her voice:\n\"I hope, sir, you have brought no ill news. We have had so much sorrow\nof late.\"\n\"I know it, indeed,\" the gentleman said. \"I bring no bad news of your\nbrother's health; he is abroad, I think.\"\n\"Yes, at Genoa; he was at Genoa when we heard last; we have not heard\nfrom him since our father's death.\"\n\"Ah! that was a sad loss for him and for you all. What a lovely place\nyou have here, but very far removed from 'the world'--the world where\nyou would shine as a bright star of beauty.\"\nThis broad flattery was received very differently from what the speaker\nexpected. Joyce's face underwent an instant change, as she said:\n\"I think, sir, if you please, I must ask you to excuse me, for I have\nsome things which are needing my attention this morning; perhaps,\"\nfearing she might seem deficient in courtesy, \"you would like to rest a\nlittle while.\"\n\"You are very kind, fair lady; I will accept your offer, I shall be glad\nto rest. What a noble hall!\" he exclaimed, as he stepped across the\nthreshold, where Piers was leaning against the old oak table, his\ncrutches under his arm.\n\"Piers,\" Joyce said, \"this gentleman wishes to rest; will you ask Sarah\nto fetch him some refreshment?\" She was thus dismissing the guest to the\ncare of her brother, glad to escape from his prolonged and embarrassing\nscrutiny of her face, when Lord Maythorne said:\n\"Pardon me, I want to speak to you on a serious matter. I ought to have\nintroduced myself earlier. I am Lord Maythorne; you will have heard of\nme?\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said, calmly; \"yes, I have heard of you.\"\n\"No good report, I will venture to affirm, guessing, as I do with some\ncertainty, from whom the report came. If you tell that little boy--lame,\nI see, poor fellow!--to leave us, I will briefly relate the\ncircumstances of my friendship with your brother. Come, Miss Falconer,\ndo not be unjust to me, but hear what I have to say. I prefer that our\nconversation should be private; it is of great importance that you\nshould hear what I have to say, _alone_.\"\nJoyce hesitated; that instinctive dread of men who are neither\nhonourable nor good, which all pure-minded maidens feel, made Joyce\nshrink back from the very touch of Lord Maythorne's hand, as he tried to\ntake hers, with a gesture of profound reverence and raise it to his\nlips.\n\"I little thought,\" he murmured, \"that I should find in Melville's\nsister any one so charming, and I confess that I am _boulevers\u00e9_ at\nonce. Nay, do not look so sternly at me.\"\n\"I do not know what right you have, my lord, to come here to alarm and\nannoy me. If the matter you have to tell me is important about\nMelville, I would refer you to my brother Ralph, and Mr. Paget, who is\nmy dear father's executor.\"\nPiers, who had been watching the whole scene, now came hastily forward.\n\"Ralph has gone into the Wells market, and Joyce has no one at home but\nme to take care of her. She does not wish you to stay, and you ought to\nsee that, and go away.\"\n\"You had better try the effect of one of your crutches on me, my boy! I\nam not going away, at present.\"\nPiers reddened, and was beginning an angry rejoinder, when Joyce said,\nin a low tone:\n\"Go and stand at the further end of the hall, Piers, and I will go into\nthe porch. If I want you I will call, but do not let mother know anyone\nis here. Now,\" she said, turning to Lord Maythorne, \"we will go into the\nporch, if you please, and you can tell me about Melville.\"\n\"Well,\" Lord Maythorne said. \"I had an interest in your brother, and I\nshould have pulled him through his troubles, if it had not been for the\nmeddling interference of a kinsman of mine, a young fellow--great in his\nown eyes--who cants like any old woman, and can turn up the whites of\nhis eyes with any Methodist in the land. He made a nice mess of it for\nyour brother owes me the money, and if he had left us alone we should\nhave arranged matters. As it was the whole story came out, your brother\nwas 'sent down' and those sharks the tradespeople, poured bills upon\nyour father's head.\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said, \"which my father, my dear father, paid. What does\nMelville owe you?\"\n\"A pretty round sum, but I would let it rest at five hundred pounds.\"\n\"Five hundred! Oh! it is impossible we could pay that. I will ask Mr.\nWatson and Mr. Paget----\"\n\"Pray do nothing of the sort,\" said Lord Maythorne, with lofty\nsuperiority; \"it is a mere trifle, but just now it happens to be a\nlittle inconvenient. The debts are such, as no _honourable_ man would\nleave unpaid. I promised Melville to keep them secret, and I have no\nwish to let the town crier go about with the news, but I naturally\njudged that on the death of his father, your brother would come into his\nfortune, and repay me.\"\n\"I do not think it is possible,\" Joyce said. \"My dear father had so many\nsons, and it was hard to provide for them. Please let me think about it,\nand give you an answer. I must consult Ralph, who is in charge here now,\ntill Melville comes home.\"\n\"Nay, I would ask as a great favour that you consult no one. If, when\nyour brother returns, you can come to any arrangement, let me know. I\nwould not wish to _press_ my claim unduly. I think you have seen my\nyoung nephew, Gilbert Arundel; he got a pitiable hold over your brother.\nIt is not the best taste to abuse one's own relations, so I will forbear\ngiving you Arundel's character _in extenso_; suffice it to say, he is a\nhypocrite. He has been playing fast and loose ever since he was a boy,\nwith a fair lady much older than himself; he fancies himself in love\nwith her, and she is so foolish as to believe it. The ten years which\nseparate them in age is a trifle in his eyes. She is handsome enough,\nand fascinating; knows the world and its ways, and, resents my good\nsister's pious exhortations, rather laughs at them, in fact. Am I\nspeaking in riddles? Arundel's mother is my step-sister; my father\ntaking it into his head to marry for the second time, when no one\nexpected him to do so. But it was a lucky thing for the world at large\nthat he did marry, for I am the result!\" The low satirical laugh had a\nring of bitterness in it, and the face that was really handsome, was\nclouded by a most disagreeable expression.\nIt was a hard ordeal for Joyce to be thus, as it were, in the hands of\na keen-witted man of the world, who, when he had finished his own story,\nbegan to pour out the most fulsome flattery, and to appear to take it\nfor granted that Joyce would be won by it. He little knew the strength\nand courage which the \"rustic beauty,\" as he inwardly called her, could\nshow.\nAs soon as she could get a word in, she rallied herself, and said, in a\nlow, determined voice:\n\"I do not wish to hear any more, my lord. I do not think you have any\nright to come here and offend me by saying what you cannot mean. I will\ntake advice about my brother's debts to you, and, if you please, I will\nlet you know the result.\"\n\"What a charming woman of business!\" exclaimed Lord Maythorne. \"A\nveritable Portia. A little indignant protest is so becoming. Well, well,\nwe will leave the matter for the present.\"\nAnd now a figure, clothed in deepest mourning, appeared from the hall\nbehind, and Mrs. Falconer with a curtsey which was profoundly\nrespectful, said:\n\"May I ask, sir, what brings you to the house of a poor widow? My\ndaughter is very young and very inexperienced; I cannot allow you to\nremain to annoy her.\"\n\"My good lady, I am your daughter's slave. I am ready to lie at her\nfeet. Annoy her, forsooth!\"\nJoyce, who had endured bravely up to this moment, sprang towards her\nmother as if instinctively for protection, and Mrs. Falconer took her\nhand in hers.\n\"What is it, my dear, what is it? Piers came to call me; I thought you\nwere distressed.\"\nThis was really the first time since her sorrow that Mrs. Falconer had\nroused herself to take an interest in anything; but Piers' summons, with\nthe announcement that there was a man in the porch talking to Joyce, and\nthat he knew by the sound of her voice she was frightened, had not been\nin vain. The maternal love, deep in Mrs. Falconer's heart, asserted\nitself, and put to flight for the time the selfish brooding over her\nsorrow, in which for so many weeks she had indulged.\n\"Joyce is very young,\" she said, tenderly, \"and she has been left to\nbear a burden too heavy for her years. I beg you, sir, to say no more to\nhurt her and annoy her, but to leave the premises.\"\n\"My dear madam,\" Lord Maythorne said, \"I came in a friendly spirit to\ndiscuss a little business about your elder and very hopeful son. He owes\nme some eight hundred pounds--a debt of honour, but at the same time a\ndebt;\" and, setting his teeth, \"_One I mean to have paid!_ It may seem a\ntrifle to the owner of these broad acres, and to the inhabitants of this\ngrand ancestral home, but to me it happens to be no trifle. Good\nmorning.\"\nLord Maythorne turned away, raising his hat to Joyce, and saying:\n\"_Adieu, mia bella! adieu!_ but _au revoir! au revoir!_\"\nMrs. Falconer pressed Joyce, trembling and frightened to her side,\nsaying, in a low voice:\n\"What does he mean? Who is he?\"\n\"He means that Melville has lost money to him by gambling; I think he is\nLord Maythorne.\"",

Joyce draw up\nthe blinds and set the chairs.\" Mrs. Falconer said this, with something\nof her old quickness.\n\"Our little parlour would be warmer, mother; this room feels cold,\"\nJoyce said, in a low tone, as she obeyed her mother, and noticed the\ncold, damp, unused atmosphere, which always clings to a room that has\nbeen closed for some time.\nThat room, with its three windows set in thick frames, with deep\nwindow-seats beneath, had been Mrs. Falconer's pride. As she looked\nround now, the furniture seemed dull, and the whole aspect of things\nchanged.\n\"Yes,\" she said, sadly, \"yes, you are right, Joyce; this room is not fit\nto sit down in; we will go to our own sitting room, if his lordship will\nfollow me.\"\nThe whole party adjourned there, and Piers, with unusual forethought,\nhad already ordered a tray to be brought in; for it was always _en\nr\u00e8gle_ in country houses in those days to offer refreshment of wine and\ncake, as calls were paid early, just as afternoon tea is brought in now\nfor visitors later in the day.\nMrs. Arundel left the Bishop to talk to Mrs. Falconer, and Gratian won\nPiers' heart by professing the deepest interest in his drawer full of\nbirds' eggs, which happened to be opened. That was one of Gratian's\nstrongest weapons; she took, or appeared to take, an interest in\neverybody's particular hobby, and yet she was listening with one ear to\nevery word that passed between Mrs. Arundel and Joyce. Poor Piers was\nquite unconscious that he had not her whole attention. When Mr. Law\njoined the discussion she withdrew and said to Joyce, \"I should like to\nsee the grounds, would you show me round.\" Piers wondered at her abrupt\ndeparture from the contemplation of the wren's eggs, and his animated\nstory of the way the little wrens huddle together in a nest in the\nwinter, under ground, in a hedge facing south, and come out to try the\nair in the first warm days in February, retiring again if it is too cold\nfor them.\nJoyce led the way, thankful to see how much more her mother looked like\nherself, as she told to the sympathetic ear of the Bishop the story of\nher grief.\nGratian took pains to suit herself to her company; she always did. She\nlinked her arm through Joyce's, and talked in a low voice, instead of\nher wonted high pitched rattle. She told her how grieved she felt for\nher; she could easily imagine what such a sorrow must be; for she, a\n\"poor orphan\" herself, could indeed sympathise with her.\nSo she talked, as they paced the gravel walk under the sunny south wall\nof the old-fashioned garden, where the arms of a huge pear-tree were\nstill heavily laden with brown fruit, and where bushes of pale lilac,\nMichaelmas daisies, and lavender, still attracted a number of late bees\nand errant wasps, who, like all the rest of the world, found it hard to\nbelieve that this was the November sunshine of a short winter's day, and\nnot the long drawn out heat of July.\n\"I should like to know more of you; to see more,\" Gratian was saying.\n\"Of course, I expected you were charming from what Gilbert told me.\nGilbert and I are _great_ friends; he tells me everything.\"\nA scarcely perceptible recoil, in the little figure by her side, was not\nlost on Gratian.\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"he is a dear boy--a little spoiled by the notions he\nhas taken up lately; but they are spreading everywhere. The Cambridge\nmen are even worse than the Oxford men. However, I won't quarrel with\nGilbert about that, and I can take a little preachment from him. Aunt\nBella is pleased with anything Gilbert says or does; and as to\nMaythorne----\"\nJoyce started, very visibly this time, at that name, and said,\nwithdrawing her hand from her companion's arm, and stooping to gather\nsome sprigs of lavender:\n\"I suppose Lord Maythorne is a relation of yours?\"\n\"Distant; very distant,\" was the reply. \"A connection is nearer the\ntruth.\"\n\"Because,\" Joyce said, \"I think he is a very bad and wicked man, and I\nwish you could tell him never to come here again.\"\n\"Come here! Has he been here,\" Gratian exclaimed. \"What on earth did he\ncome here for?\"\n\"He had not been gone half-an-hour before the Bishop's carriage drove\nup. He has, as you know, done my eldest brother a great deal of\nmischief; and, though my dear father thought he had cleared all his\ndebts, this Lord Maythorne says that he still owes him a great deal, and\nwe cannot pay it.\"\n\"And is that what he came to say; very kind and pleasant of him, I must\nconfess. I expect he said a great deal more.\"\nJoyce blushed scarlet.\n\"He was very impertinent,\" she said, \"and talked in a very free way to\nme, but it is over now, and I wish to forget it. Only, if you can, will\nyou prevent him from coming again; or as he is Mrs. Arundel's brother,\ncould you ask _her_ to prevent him. When I have consulted Mr. Paget,\ndear father's executor and our trustee, I will try if any of the money\ncan be paid.\"\n\"Don't think of paying a farthing,\" Gratian said, \"pray; I will see what\nI can do in the matter. I will talk to Gilbert. Gilbert is certain to do\nwhat I ask him, and I know how much he cared about your brother. Yes,\nyou may depend upon my doing my best, you darling!\" Gratian said,\nstooping down and kissing Joyce's rounded cheek.\nJoyce made no response, as Gratian expected, and then they walked\nsilently to the house.\nAs they drove towards Wells, Gratian, after a pause suddenly said:\n\"Aunt Bella, Maythorne is still in this neighbourhood. He has been at\nFair Acres to-day.\"\n\"Maythorne!\" Mrs. Arundel exclaimed. Then to herself, but not aloud, she\nsaid:\n\"I must let Gilbert know at once.\"\n[Illustration]",

She covered her crape with a large apron, and pinned\nback the long \"weepers\" of her large widow's cap, and went about the\nhouse again, with none of her old sprightly manner, but still going\nthrough her duties in regular order.\nIt was a time which needed much patience, for, as was natural, Mrs.\nFalconer saw many things which she considered neglected, and Joyce felt\nherself held responsible for the misdemeanours of the maids, especially\nof Susan Priday.\nThe schoolmistress at Mendip had given Susan an excellent character, and\nMrs. More had dictated a note to Joyce from her sick bed, telling her\nthat she believed Susan might really prove a friend as well as a\nservant, for gratitude would be the spring of all her work, gratitude to\nJoyce for taking her, and holding her free from all blame in her\nfather's ill-doings and bad life, which had apparently been the cause\nof the great sorrow which had fallen upon Fair Acres.\nMrs. Falconer had consented with the cold apathetic consent which was\ndiscouraging enough. She had taken little or no notice of Susan's\npresence in the kitchen and dairy till she began to come forth from her\nseclusion. Then, indeed, poor Susan had a hard time of it; but love, and\ngratitude to Joyce, were too strong for her to show any resentment for\nthe many unjust suspicions and sharp reproofs which she had to bear.\n\"It's only what I must look for, Miss Joyce,\" she said one day, when the\nbreaking of a plate, which she had never touched, was at once laid to\nher charge. \"It's only what I must look for. My dear mother always used\nto say, when poor father beat and ill-used her, that she remembered some\nwords of St. Peter, that if you were buffeted for doing _well_, that is,\ndoing your best, and took it patiently, it was acceptable in God's\nsight. Besides, Miss Joyce, I have been used to hard words, and I know\nhow brokenhearted the poor mistress is; why, she is even a bit cross to\nMaster Piers and you, which is more than I can understand, for you are\nnext door to an angel, Miss Joyce.\"\n\"No, Susan I don't feel at all angelic. That is a mistake. I feel angry\nand discontented sometimes, if I don't show it. There are so many\ntroubles which can't be talked of.\"\n\"Yes, miss, I know that well enough; but you can tell them to God, and\nthat's a rare comfort. Dozens of times in the day I tell Him of my\nbiggest trouble, that I have a father who----\"\nSusan stopped, threw her coarse apron over her head, and ran away to\nscour the pans in the dairy till they shone like silver.",

Except for a visit of a few days from Miss Falconer and\nCharlotte, nothing occurred to break the monotony of this dead time of\nthe year. Farming and gardening operations were suspended, and Ralph got\nout his beloved books again, and Piers arranged and re-arranged his\nlarge collection of curiosities, and Christmas drew near.\nJoyce had given up listening for a footstep on the road, or looking\nanxiously for the old postman, who trudged from Wells, on fine days,\nwith the letters, but in bad weather pleased himself as to the length of\nhis rounds.\nMrs. Falconer worked, and knitted, and darned, and, when the wind blew\nfiercely round the house on the dark winter nights, thought of her\nlittle Middies tossing about on the wide sea; and of Melville in that\nfar-off land, which she knew more by its shape of a boot on the map\nPiers had hung up in his room, than by any distinct notion of what was\nto be seen there.\nRome, Florence, Naples, were but names to her, and as dim and distant as\nHaiphong or Hong Kong are to many in the present day.\n'Melville was in Italy,' and her interest in the country was expressed\nin these words. Melville's letter, written on hearing of his father's\ndeath, was sad enough. Weak natures like his, always find relief in\ntrouble by many words, and give vent to grief by vain protestations of\naffection and of remorse.\nMrs. Falconer treasured the letter, and read it many times, and thought\nJoyce unfeeling in expressing so little sympathy with her brother. There\ncould be no doubt that all his wilful disregard of his father's wishes\nstarted up before Melville, now that it was too late to atone for them,\nand for the time, as he said, \"he was distracted with grief.\" But there\nwas no word of a desire to redeem the past by coming to Fair Acres and\ndoing his best to perform his duties there. Selfish people are not cured\nby trouble of their selfishness. It commonly happens that they are more\nselfish in their grief than in their joy, more self-absorbed by pain\nthan pleasure.\nWhile Melville could write of his distracted condition, of his love for\nhis father, of his burning indignation against the wretch who had caused\nhis death, and of his determination to have him brought to justice,\nJoyce was silent; only sometimes, when kneeling by Piers' bed, would she\nallow her grief full vent; only when alone in the seat under the fir\ntrees would she cry out in the bitterness of her heart for the lost\nfather who had been so dear to her.",

She knew now, as the time went on, that\nshe loved him, and that, after all, she was nothing to him. How could\nshe have been so foolish? How often she had laughed at Charlotte's\nfancied admirers, at her continual discovery that some one was in love\nwith her, but was kept back by circumstances from declaring his\ndevotion! For the minor canon was one of a long list of visionary\nadmirers, and he had been followed by the pale-faced clergyman she had\nmet at Barley Wood, about whom, during the few days Charlotte had spent\nat Fair Acres, she had talked, till Joyce grew weary of the theme.\n\"Such nonsense!\" she had said. \"Besides, no girl ought to acknowledge\nherself to be in love till she has had good reason given her. It is not\nnice; it is not womanly.\"\nAnd as day by day passed, and night after night, when she leaned against\nthe casement of her window, when the stars were throbbing and shining in\nthe deep-blue of the winter's sky, she had to confess, with deep\nabasement of spirit, that she had been as weak as poor Charlotte, nay,\nweaker; for as Charlotte's heroes fell from their pedestals, or vanished\ninto thin air like the mirage in the desert, she could always replace\nthem, and pour forth her romantic soul in verses addressed to new\nobjects, as if the old had never existed.\nBut Joyce told herself she must suffer the consequences of her weakness\nfor ever and a day. No one could ever again be to her what Gilbert had\nbeen, in that first happy time of awakening love.\nJoyce's pale cheeks and wistful eyes at last attracted her mother's\nnotice. In these days she would have been taken to see a doctor, ordered\nchange of air and scene, and put upon some _r\u00e9gime_ as to food. But,\nexcept in cases of severe illness, people did not resort to doctors as\nthey do now-a-days, and the nervous patients and chronic invalids,\nresigned themselves to unlimited home physic, and took their poor health\nas a matter of course.\n\"Joyce,\" Mrs. Falconer said, one day, early in February, when the season\nof Christmas they had all dreaded so much was past; \"Joyce, I think it\nwould do you good to spend a few days with Aunt Letitia at Wells.\"\nJoyce tried to smile.\n\"I don't want to be done good to, mother; besides, I can't leave you.\"\n\"Yes, you can.

It's a wonder Mrs. More has not asked you to Barley Wood again.\"\n\"She has been so ill,\" Joyce said; \"it is not likely she could invite\nme.\"\n\"And then there is Mrs. Arundel and her niece that came here last fall;\nnot a word have we heard of them.\"\n\"Yes, mother; you forget. I have heard twice, about--about Lord\nMaythorne. Mrs. Arundel has kept him from coming here again. Besides,\nshe is busy settling into a home, and besides----\"\n\"I think it is very odd, Mr. Arundel has never written, or come here\nagain.\"\n\"He wrote to me once,\" Joyce said, in a low voice.\n\"Did you answer the letter?\"\n\"No, mother,\" Joyce said, springing up quickly, and, with a great\neffort, throwing off her sadness. \"No; there was nothing to answer. But\nI _will_ go and stay a day or two with Aunt Letitia, if you want to get\nrid of me. Ralph can take a note in to Wells to-morrow, when he goes in\nto the market.

      "text": "Miss Falconer was really pleased that Joyce should propose a visit, and\nthe little guest-chamber in the Vicar's Close was made ready with\nwilling hands, and Charlotte hailed Joyce's appearance, that she might\ntell her of all her hopes and fears.\nCharlotte had been twice at the Palace during the winter. Mrs. Law,\ngentle and kindly, had taken an interest in the young people in Wells,\nand had invited Charlotte, amongst others, to tea. Tea at six o'clock,\non some day when the bishop and his chaplain and Mr. Henry Law, were\nabsent on some business in the diocese.\nIf it had been a great thing to visit Mrs. Hannah More at Barley Wood,\nit was a greater to take tea at the palace. With the wigs of the last\nand preceding century, the bishops have thrown off a great deal of the\nepiscopal state, which was once considered a part of the duty of the\npeer spiritual. And a certain air of solemnity pervaded the Wells\npalace, even when presided over by such true \"gentlefolks\" as the\nbishop and Mrs. Law. That old-fashioned word seems to suit the host and\nhostess at the Wells palace far better than any other term I could use.\nThat innate grace and refinement of feeling is sometimes, it is true,\nacquired, but it is a plant of slow growth, especially amongst those,\nwho suddenly raised to a position of importance in the Church, feel the\nelevation makes them a little dizzy. The Bishop's wife, then presiding\nover the palace, had always moved in the higher circles of society, and,\ntherefore, neither at Carlisle nor Wells did she find it necessary to\nimpress upon humbler people that she stood on a vantage ground to which\nfew could approach. She was dignified, though she was gentle, and no one\nwould ever pass the barrier which divides familiarity, from free and\npleasant intercourse. Mrs. Law, like everyone else, was greatly taken\nwith Joyce Falconer; and again poor Charlotte began to feel that with no\neffort at all her cousin was winning her way, and making an impression\nwhich, with all her efforts, she felt she did not succeed in doing.\nMiss Falconer was surprised when, the day after the girls had spent an\nevening at the palace, Mrs. Law sent a little three-cornered note of\ninvitation to Joyce to spend Sunday at the palace before she returned\nto Fair Acres. The footman waited for a reply, and the discussion of\nMrs. Law's note caused no little excitement in the parlour, of which the\nservant, if he had been so minded, could have heard every word.\n\"My dear Joyce, what will you do? You have no suitable dress for such a\nvisit; and yet it is a pity to miss it. I really do not know what to\nadvise.\"\n\"I think I should like to go to the palace, Aunt Letitia,\" Joyce said.\n\"Like! yes; but are you prepared for such a visit?\"\n\"Oh! yes; I have my best frock, the black bombazine, and my crape\nbonnet. That need not hinder me.\"\n\"But, my dear, people in Mrs. Law's position wear evening gowns, with\nlow necks and short sleeves. _I_ have moved in these circles, and of\ncourse----\"\n\"We must not keep the servant waiting, Aunt Letitia; if you give me\nleave, I should like to accept the invitation.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Miss Falconer; \"there is my writing-case; take care\nhow you write; begin, 'Miss Joyce Falconer presents her respects.'\"\n\"But Mrs. Law addresses me as, 'Dear Miss Falconer'; had I not better\nbegin, 'Dear Madam, or dear Mrs. Law'?\"\n\"Oh! _not_ 'Dear Mrs. Law.' My dear child, how ignorant you are of\netiquette.\"\nJoyce seated herself, and wrote a few words accepting the invitation\nfrom Saturday to the Monday following, and took it herself to the\nfootman.\n\"You should have rung for Phoebe, really Joyce, my _dear_!\" But it was\ntoo late. Charlotte, who had been \"composing\" in the sitting-room\nupstairs, had heard voices, and now came down just as Joyce had closed\nthe door on the footman from the palace.\n\"An invitation to _stay_ at the palace! Oh! Joyce, how fortunate you\nare. Mrs. Law might have asked me!\"\n\"She knows you live in the place, my love,\" said Miss Falconer.\nCharlotte sighed. \"If I did _not_ live here it would be all the same.\"\nBut Charlotte was really an amiable girl, and her devotion to Joyce was\nsincere and true.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"what will you wear, dear? Can I lend you any pretty\nthings? My amber beads--or--my filigree comb. Oh! I forgot! Of course,\nyou are still in deep black.\"\n\"It is very kind of you, Charlotte,\" Joyce said; \"you always are kind;\nbut I don't want anything.\"\nThe whole of that day Joyce's visit to the palace engrossed the little\nparty in the Vicar's Close. Some cronies of Miss Falconer came in for a\ngossip by the fireside, and were duly informed of the invitation, and\nwere duly congratulatory and a little jealous, although there was a\ncertain amount of satisfaction, that it was not Charlotte whom Mrs. Law\nhad delighted to honour.",

      "text": "It was a memorable visit to Joyce, and in a way she little expected. The\nfirst evening passed pleasantly; and with a white muslin fichu, which\nMiss Falconer insisted upon making for her, crossed over her black gown,\nJoyce looked her best. The sleeves of best gowns in those days were cut\nrather short, and Joyce wore on her round, white arms a pair of black\nlace mittens, which Charlotte had lent her.\nHer beautiful hair needed no adornment; it fell round her forehead in\nnatural curls, and was piled up without the help of cushions or\nfrizzettes, a natural crown of chesnut and gold. As at Barley Wood, so\nat the palace; Joyce was too simple-minded to be stiff or constrained in\nmanner, and she conversed so pleasantly with a young son of the bishop,\nwho gave her his arm when they went to dinner, that he, in his turn, did\nhis best to be agreeable, and she was soon telling him of her little\nsailor brothers, of Piers and his collection of butterflies, of Ralph\nand his love of study, and the brave way in which he had come to live\nat Fair Acres and do his best to turn into a farmer.\nIf the Saturday evenings were pleasant, how delightful was the Sunday,\nwhen, in the sunshine of the early February day, the party from the\npalace crossed to the cloister door, and went to the morning service in\nthe cathedral. It has been said of Wells that it is always Sunday there;\nno sounds but the ringing of bells for service; no business, and no\ntraffic in the streets. But certain it is, that nowhere is the real\nSabbath stillness more profound, nor more refreshing to the tired in\nspirit, on a day like that February day, when Joyce was seated in the\nhigh pew belonging to the Bishop. The cathedral is always a vision of\nbeauty, and when the swelling of the organ and the voices of the\nchoristers are hushed, and a pause occurs after the benediction has been\npronounced, the sounds without the building seem in direct harmony with\nthose within; for the Lady Chapel abuts on the lawn of the Sub-Dean's\nresidence, where the waters of St. Joseph's Well lie deep; and there is\nthe murmur of the streams, the chirp of birds, the soft coo of pigeons,\nand the distinct chatter of the jackdaw from the West front.\nJoyce went out of the cathedral filled with peaceful thoughts of the\ntemple, of which this was but the faint shadow, the temple which has no\nneed of the sun to lighten it, for the Lamb is the light thereof.\nQuite forgetting that she ought to turn towards the cloisters, Joyce\nwalked on down the nave before the Bishop's party had missed her. The\nsweet seriousness of her face as she went out into the sunshine almost\nheld back the welcome, which was trembling on the lips of someone who\nwas standing near the porch, and had watched her coming down the wide\nnave.\nShe was passing out, wrapt in her own meditations when Gilbert Arundel\nput out his hand:\n\"Joyce!\"\nShe started, and blushed rosy red.\n\"You did forget me, then!\" he exclaimed, reproachfully.\n\"Forget you, no.\"\n\"You did not reply to my letter?\"\n\"You did not ask me to write.\"\nThey now found themselves by the turnstile under the old clock, that\nquaint clock which, it is said, was made to strike many times in\nsuccession for the amusement of that gracious and sagacious King James,\nwho laughed till his sides ached, as the old knights, in their black\narmour, hit the bell with their battle-axes, beneath the suggestive\nmotto, \"Ne quid pereat.\" They hit it now with, all their wonted vigour\nfour times, and then the clock struck _one_.\n[Illustration: Clock at Wells]\n\"We have come the wrong way. I am staying at the palace till to-morrow,\"\nJoyce said.\n\"At the palace! I am glad to hear it; but your mother, whom I saw\nyesterday, did not know it.\"\n\"No; it was a sudden thought. I mean Mrs. Law only asked me on Friday.\"\n\"I am glad you are at the palace,\" Gilbert said. \"I know I shall have a\nfriend in the Bishop.\"\nJoyce made no remark to this, and they retraced their steps in silence\ntill they had crossed the drawbridge and were in the palace grounds.\n\"I have thought so much of you,\" he said, earnestly. \"I am now come, as\nI said I should, to present my petition. Is there any hope?\"\nJoyce turned away her head, and did not answer.\nWhen they reached the palace, a footman threw open the door:\n\"Dinner is served,\" he said, in a voice which was intended to be a mild\nreproof.\n\"Can I see his lordship?\" Gilbert asked; while Joyce ran upstairs to her\nroom on the upper floor.\n\"His lordship is just sitting down to dinner, sir. What name----\"\nGilbert took out a card and handed it to the man, leaving him in the\nhall till he knew the Bishop's will.\nPresently he reappeared.\n\"I am requested to beg you, sir, to go into the dining-room at once:\nthis way.\"\nThe Bishop rose, and gave Gilbert Arundel a very different greeting\nfrom that which he had granted Lord Maythorne.\n\"My dear young friend, welcome for your _mother's_ sake, always welcome,\nand for your own. How could you doubt it? Why stand on ceremony? But we\nare in some distress,\" he said, with a sly twinkle in his eye; \"we have\nlost a young lady: she vanished into thin air as we left the cathedral.\nPerhaps some knight-errant has carried her off. Ah! I see you know\nsomething about her. Well, sit down; and, Barker,\" to one of the\nservants, \"Miss Falconer's place next Mr. Arundel's.\"\nThe Bishop dearly loved a little love affair, and he fancied he descried\none in \"the air.\"\nIt was a great trial of Joyce's self-possession when the door of the\ndining-room was opened for her by a servant, and she had to pass to her\nplace at the long dining-table. The Bishop's son came to the rescue,\nmaking room for her by standing up and showing her the vacant place.\n\"I am sorry I was late,\" she said.\n\"It is a lovely day,\" was the rejoinder. \"I do not wonder that you took\na turn after service.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Law, kindly. \"I saw your cousin in the cathedral, and I\nthought it probable that you would walk home with her.\"\n\"No,\" Joyce said, in a low voice, \"I did not go home with Charlotte.\"\nOne person at least appreciated the honesty of this confession, and\nGilbert told himself that it was a part of Joyce's crystal transparency\nof character, that she would not even allow an assertion about herself\nto pass if it were not absolutely true.\nWhen Joyce was sitting after dinner, with Mrs. Law and several ladies,\nin the long gallery, the Bishop's son brought her a message.\n\"My father would like to see you in his study for a few minutes. Will\nyou kindly follow me?\"\nJoyce obeyed, but her heart beat fast, and she dreaded what the Bishop\nmight have to say to her. Something about Melville; some bad news of the\nlittle Middies: her thoughts flew in all directions.\nThe Bishop had already seated himself in his crimson leather chair, and,\nwhen Mr. Law closed the door, she found herself alone with his lordship.\n\"My dear young lady,\" he said, in his slow, sonorous tones, \"as I know\nyou are, alas! fatherless, will you allow me to stand, for the moment,\nin the place of a father? A young gentleman, the son of an old friend,\nhas told me to-day that he seeks the honour of paying his addresses to\nyou. He went to Fair Acres last night and received your mother's\nsanction, tempered, no doubt, with the natural pain of losing you. But\nshe gives her consent, and I venture to endorse it. As chief pastor and\nfather of the diocese, over which I have so recently come to preside, I\ndo earnestly commend to you the son of my old friend, Gilbert Arundel. I\npropose that you should take a ramble together after service, in the\nspring twilight, and when we meet at the evening meal, I hope I may find\nyou have made my young friend happy.\"\nThe Bishop's speech may sound to us unnecessarily long and formal, but,\nsixty years ago, the old spirit of chivalrous respect towards maidens,\nin approaching the subject of marriage, had not then died out. Perhaps,\nalso, in the time of the good Bishop, when the first gentleman in Europe\nwas setting so wretched an example in his behaviour, good and honourable\nmen felt it the more incumbent on them to give the woman the full\nprivileges of her position.\nLove was to be sought as a favour granted, not claimed in a careless\nfashion as a right; while the whole aspect of courtship and marriage was\ndealt with more seriously than it is in our day.\nBarriers are more easily broken down than set up again, and, perhaps,\nthere is too great a tendency now-a-days to treat what is grave as a\njest, and to show but little inclination to tread in the paths which\nour mothers and grandmothers found safe. Thus the Bishop, when he had\nheard from Gilbert's lips the object of his visit to Wells, thought it\nhis duty to speak to Joyce in the grave manner I have described.\nThe Bishop rose from his chair, and, laying his hand on Joyce's head,\nsolemnly pronounced a blessing, and, with crimson cheek and bowed head,\nshe left him, to prepare to go to the afternoon service.\nLater in the day, the supreme moment in her young life came, when she\nwalked with Gilbert in the fields towards Dinder, turning to the left,\nwhere, in a tangled copse, the first budding flowers of the starry\ncelandines were peeping amidst fallen leaves and mosses.\nThe clustering primrose buds were hardly yet showing themselves amongst\ntheir crinkled leaves, and only the upright stems of the alders, and the\nlowest boughs of the maples and hazel bushes displayed the first emerald\ngreen of spring. It was a time and place for the exchange of first young\nlove, and confidences never to be forgotten.\nAnd in all the changes and chances of her future life, Joyce could look\nback to that first spring afternoon, and say from her heart that it was\nthe opening for her of a new and beautiful chapter. If the hopes of the\nearlier days of their acquaintance had lain dormant during the winter,\nthey now sprang up with the coming life of the spring time, and were\nsweet with the promise of the future.\nWhen once Gilbert had found voice to tell his story he was eloquent, and\nwhen once Joyce had given her response there was no further need for\nreticence.\n\"And why did you not write to me?\" he asked.\n\"As I said, because you did not ask me; and then when your uncle came,\nhe told me that you cared for Miss Anson; and I thought, _half_ thought,\nit might be true.\"\nGilbert made an impatient gesture.\n\"You only _half_ thought so; you knew, Joyce, you knew better. So,\" he\nwent on under his breath, \"that is the mischief he went to Fair Acres to\nwork. My mother soon stopped him from daring to persecute you.\"\n\"Mr. Paget and Mr. Gill said there was no lawful claim on poor Melville,\nfor the money had been lent him to gamble with, and that Lord Maythorne\nknew he had no just claim to it.\"\n\"Of course he knew it; he thought he would frighten you, and your poor\nmother. But let us not speak more of him.\"\n\"I wonder what will be done when Melville comes home, for I suppose he\nwill come home in the summer.\"\n\"Yes; perhaps he may have turned over a new leaf, as the children say;\nanyhow, I can't help being grateful to Melville.\"\n\"To Melville?\" she said.\n\"Yes; for was it not he who invited me to Fair Acres, to find _you_, my\ndarling.\"\nThen he drew her closer, and with her hand in his arm, they walked\nthrough the quiet fields back to the little city.\nThe cathedral stood up in a dark mysterious mass against the clear sky.",

      "text": "ON THE ROAD TO BRISTOL.\nA carriage stood before the door of Fair Acres one bright morning in\nApril, an old-fashioned travelling carriage, with a \"dickey,\" or back\nseat piled with luggage, and more packages waiting to be pushed under\nthe seat inside, which a lady was superintending and remonstrating with\na young sailor for his rough and ready help.\n\"Take care, take care, Harry; there is glass in that hamper. Oh! we must\nhave the carriage closed after all.\"\n\"Nonsense, Joyce; I'll manage it. There, let that bag go into the hold,\nand heave over the box. I'll cram them all in.\"\n\"The captain is right, miss--beg your pardon, missus, I should\nsay\"--said old Thomas, wiping his head vigorously with his pocket\nhandkerchief.\n\"Very well; now we are all ready. I hope mother is coming. Gently,\nFalcon, gently; don't pull dear old Duke so roughly.\"\n\"I want to take Duke to Bristol, mother; Grannie has left Fair Acres,\nand she is old; why shouldn't Duke?\"\n\"Duke would not be happy in Great George Street; would you, dear Duke?\"\nJoyce bent down to the grizzled head of the friend of so many years, and\nsaid:\n\"Ah! Duke, we are all getting old.\"\nPresently more voices were heard in the hall, and Mrs. Falconer appeared\nwith a little grand-daughter on either side, while Susan Priday brought\nup the procession with the baby in her arms.\n\"Now, dear mother, I think we are all ready. Have you enough wraps?\nWhere are Melville and Gratian and Piers?\"\n\"Melville is not dressed,\" said Piers, coming forward, \"and Gratian has\njust had her cup of chocolate taken her in bed.\"\n\"I must run and say Good-bye to her,\" exclaimed Joyce. \"What a pity to\nlie in bed on this lovely morning!\"\nJoyce tripped upstairs and tapped at the door of the room which had been\nher mother's in years past.\nTo the amazement of all the world, Gratian Anson had signified to\nMelville Falconer that she was ready to be mistress of Fair Acres, and\ninclude him in the bargain. On the whole the plan had answered fairly\nwell; but Mrs. Falconer had found the new _r\u00e9gime_ a perpetual vexation,\nand three years before this time had, by her son-in-law's advice,\nretired to a little cottage on Clifton Down with Piers, within reach of\nthe great joy and comfort of her declining years--Joyce and her husband\nand children.\nGratian kept Melville in good order. There were rumours in the\nneighbourhood that she took charge of the purse, and that an allowance\nwas doled out to her lord and master, which she never permitted him to\nexceed. However that might be, Gratian certainly managed to get through\nwithout heavy debts, and the squire's will had provided for the\nmaintenance of his widow, and the boys had each their portion paid from\nthe estate.\nMr. Watson and Ralph virtually managed the farm, and Ralph held a good\nposition and was greatly respected. Only one of the twins was left. The\nsea rolled over the bright hair of Bunny, on his second voyage. He was\nwashed from the mast by a huge wave, off the coast of Africa, and\nengulfed in the stormy waters, never to rise again. This sorrow had told\ngreatly on Mrs. Falconer, and she had aged very much since we saw her\nlast. But she was touchingly gentle and tender to Joyce, and her\nchildren were the delight of her heart.\nJoyce's tap was answered by a sleepy \"Come in.\"\n\"We are just starting, Gratian,\" Joyce said; \"I could not go without\nbidding you good-bye, and thanking you for a very pleasant visit.\"\n\"What makes you start so early?\"\n\"Gilbert wished us to be off by ten o'clock. He says Bristol is likely\nto be in a ferment to-day, and he did not wish us to be late.\"\n\"Late! Well I should think twelve would have been time enough to start.\nBid mother and Piers good-bye for me. Is Melville down stairs?\"\n\"I have not seen him,\" Joyce said; \"but perhaps he is in the study.\"\n\"Good-bye again,\" Joyce said, stooping to kiss Gratian; \"we have had a\nvery happy fortnight. I do like my children to know the dear old place.\"\n\"We are very glad to have you,\" Gratian replied; \"and, Joyce, if you pay\na visit at any of the best houses at Clifton, or near Bristol, notice if\nthe curtains are flowered damask or watered, for new curtains we _must_\nhave in the dining room.\"\nAnother yawn, and \"Good-bye, love to Aunt Annabella,\" and Gratian's\nhead, in the many-frilled night-cap, which scarcely hid a row of\ncurl-papers, fell back upon the pillow.\nAnd now Falcon's voice was heard.\n\"Mother, _do_ come; why doesn't Aunt Gratian get up? mother! How lazy\nshe is!\"\n\"Hush! Falcon,\" for Joyce saw her brother issuing forth from his\ndressing-room in a magnificent loose dressing-gown, and a scarlet fez\nwith a tassel on his head.\n\"Why! Joyce, off already?\" he said; \"I must come down and see the last\nof the infants. Thank goodness they are not mine!\"\n\"I have been to bid Gratian good-bye, and thanked her for her kindness;\nwe are a large party.\"\n\"Oh! so much the better,\" said Melville, good-temperedly; \"we are very\nglad to have you. What a regular family coach! Where did that come\nfrom?\"\n\"From the 'Swan.' Ralph ordered it yesterday.\"\nAt last they were all packed in.\nJoyce was the last, and she was just about to step into the carriage\nwhen Mr. Paget came riding up.\n\"Oh! you are off, Mrs. Arundel. I just called to tell you that there is\nnews of disturbances in Bristol. A great mob collected in Queen's Square\nlast night, and political feeling is exciting the people to madness. I\nsuppose Arundel will ride out to meet you?\"\n\"He told me to start early, that we might get through Bristol before the\nafternoon.\"\n\"Ah! Well, I daresay it will be all right. Upon my word, what a pretty\nparty you are! A rose and her rosebuds--eh! Mrs. Falconer? Where is\nRalph?\"\n\"Gone early to Bridgwater; there is a cattle sale to-day, and he and Mr.\nWatson went off at six o'clock.\"\n\"Ralph does not let the grass grow under his feet,--eh! Falconer? It is\nthe early bird that finds the worm.\"\nMelville smiled. The gorgeous colours of his dressing gown and fez came\nout in grand relief against the old porch, and Mr. Paget thought to\nhimself, how odd it was that Mr. Falconer's son should be so entirely\nunlike either father or mother. He had dismounted; while old Thomas held\nthe horse, he had helped Joyce into the carriage, and patted the rounded\ncheeks of the baby, whom her mother now took from her grandmother, and\nsettled comfortably on her knee, while he called out to Falcon, who was\nin the dickey with Susan and the luggage, not to put out his eyes with a\nlong cane he was brandishing, kicking his feet vigorously all the time,\nand shouting \"Gee up!\" at the pitch of his young lungs. The two little\nrosebuds of girls sat demure and quiet on the back seat with their uncle\nPiers; and then, with a final \"Good-bye\" and waving his hands, the\nscarlet-coated post-boy cracked his whip, and Joyce and her children\nwere fairly off for home; for, sweet as the old home was, and full of\ntender memories, the large city house in Great George Street was dearer",

Some stared at the carriage\nas they passed, some hissed, and angry voices cried:\n\"No Popery!\" and \"Reform!\"\nWhen within some four miles of the city, Susan Priday leaned over and\nsaid:\n\"There is a great crowd coming on behind us, ma'am; they look a very\nrough lot.\"\nThe carriage was going up a steep hill, and just as it had slowly\nreached the top, some fifty or sixty men came out from a lane, which\nturned off towards Bath, and called out to the post-boy to stop.\nThey were fierce, wild-looking men, and, as the post-boy tried to take\nno notice and whip on his horses, the bridles were seized and the\ncarriage was surrounded.\nThen a number of voices shouted--\n\"Reform! Reform! Are ye for Reform? you grand folks; if ye are, speak\nout!\"\n\"Let go the horses' heads!\" said Piers. \"Let go! How dare you obstruct\nthe high road?\"\n\"Aye! aye! you young fool; we'll teach you manners!\" and one of the men\nclenched his fist and shook it at Piers. In another moment the crowd\nfrom behind, which Susan Priday had seen, came breathlessly up the hill,\nwomen with children in their arms, all screaming, at the top of their\nvoices, \"Reform! Reform!\"\nOne woman held up a child with a pinched, wan face, and said--\n\"You rich folks, you'd trample on us if you could, and we are starving!\nLook here!\" and she bared the legs of the poor emaciated baby. \"Look\nhere! Look at your fat, stuffed-out childer, and look at _this_!\"\n\"Look 'ee here, missus; we are a-going to Bristol to cry for Reform. If\nyou say you will have nothing to do with the tyrant, Wetherall, and his\ncursed lot, you may go on. If not, we'll seize the carriage, we'll turn\nye all out into the road, and we'll drive in state to the big meeting in\nQueen's Square! My! what a lark that will be!\"\n\"Listen,\" Joyce said, standing up in the carriage with her child in her\narms; \"I am on my way home with these little children. Surely you will\nnot stop me and endanger their lives?\"\n\"We will! we will! if you don't give us your word you are for Reform and\ndead against Wetherall.\"\n\"Why,\" Joyce said fearlessly, \"only a year ago, and near this very\nplace, the men and women of Bristol shouted, 'Long live Wetherall!' And\nnow!\"\n\"Now we say, _curse_ him!\" growled a big, brawny man.\nThe little girls, awakened by the uproar, began to cry with fear, and\nFalcon called out, \"Let mother go on, you bad men! I say, let her go on!\nFather will be so angry with you!\"\n\"Hush! hush! dear Master Falcon,\" Susan said; \"you will only make them\nworse. Hush!\"\nAnd now, as Joyce looked over the faces crowding round her, she beckoned\nto the woman, who had been thrust back by the pressure of others who\nwanted to see the inhabitants of the carriage.\n\"Come here,\" she said, holding out some of the buns; \"I am so sorry for\nyour hungry baby. Give her one of these buns, and do believe me when I\nsay I am sorry for all your troubles.\"\nThe sweet, ringing voice began to have effect, and the clamour ceased.\n\"I am no enemy of the poor. My husband and I wish to do what we can for\nyou, and I believe, nay, I know, he is an advocate of Reform, but not\nfor rebellion against authority, and violence.\"\nThe execrations were changed now to cheers.\n\"Let 'em pass, she is a good 'un; let 'em pass, she has a kind heart;\nshe has a pretty face, too. Here,\" said a man, \"I am the father of that\npoor babby; shake hands, missus.\"\nJoyce stretched out her hand at once, and it was taken in a strong grip.\n\"Thank you,\" she said; \"I knew you would not be cruel to my little\nchildren. Will you all remember that I ask you to be peaceable, and to\npray to God to help you and give you bread for your children. He is a\nkind and loving Father; don't forget that.\"\nAs Joyce stood before that seething crowd of strange, wan faces, for\nmany of them bore too plainly the marks of fasting and hunger, the baby\nin her arms raised a pitiful cry, and she pressed it closer and soothed\nit, while the baby lifted its little hand and stroked its mother's face.\n\"Aye, she is of the right sort,\" they cried; \"she is a mother who loves\nher child. She ain't too grand to cosset her babby. Let her go on!\"\nThe post-boy cracked his whip, and the carriage was just starting, when",

      "text": "A LULL IN THE STORM.\nThere was a lull in the storm as soon as the two Whig candidates were\nelected to represent the city of Bristol, and Mr. Hart-Davis withdrew\nquietly from the contest. The undercurrent, it is true, was still\nmuttering and murmuring of evil times to come, and all thinking men who\nlooked below the surface knew that it would but need a spark to kindle a\ngreat fire in Bristol, and that much wisdom, firmness, and decision,\nwould be needed amongst the rulers.\nJoyce Arundel, in her happy home life, soon lost the sense of\ninsecurity, which after that memorable drive from Fair Acres, had at\nfirst haunted her.\nFalcon's lessons, and the interest she felt in his rapid advancement,\nengrossed her every morning when her household duties were over; and\nthen she would pace up and down the garden overlooking the city, with\nher baby in her arms, while Lota and Lettice played on the wide expanse\nof even, if rather smoke-dried, turf, which sloped down from the terrace\nwalk at the back of the house, and tell herself a hundred times that no\nwife or mother in England was happier than she was.\nThe early married life of a mother whose chief interests centre in her\nown home, and who knows no craving for anything that lies beyond, is\nhappy indeed. As years pass and her children vanish, and the sweetness\nof entire dependence on her ceases of necessity with infancy and\nchildhood, the mother, weary with the battle of life, encompassed with\ndifficulties, and overburdened with requirements which the failing\nstrength of advancing years makes it hard to fulfil, can turn back to\nthat fair oasis in her pilgrimage, when the children were with her day\nand night, when her hand had power to soothe a childish trouble, and her\nvoice charm away a little pain or disappointment, or add, by her\nsympathy in joys as well as in sorrows, zest to all those simple\npleasures in which children delight.\nSometimes, even to the best mothers, I know, there comes a sudden, sharp\nawakening. The son of much love and many prayers goes far astray; the\ndaughter, her pride and joy in her early childhood, is apparently cold\nand heartless. But as a rule, I think, in the retrospect the cry is\nforced from many a mother's sad heart: \"If only I had been more to him\nin early boyhood; cared for his games, and interested myself in all his\nplay as well as work, it _might_ have been different\"; or, \"If I had\ndealt more tenderly and patiently with her when she was standing on the\nthreshold of womanhood, it might have been different!\"\nVain regrets, vain laments for some of us; but the young mother, like\nJoyce Falconer, has the children and the father of the children still\nwith her, and may, as Joyce did, sing to herself a sweet, low song of\nthanksgiving, which made Lettice stop in her play, and, running up to\nher side, say:\n\"What a pretty song mother is singing to baby!\"\nAnd now another voice was heard, rather a sad, querulous voice, which\ndid not chime in well with the mother's song, or the baby's gentle coo\nof gladness, or the laughter of the two little sisters, as Falcon dashed\nout upon them from the open door of the hall with a big ball in his\nhand, which he threw down the grass with a merry \"Halloo!\"\nFalcon's lessons, which his mother had left him to learn, were over, and\nhe was free to run and jump to his heart's content.\n\"Joyce, are you not coming to get ready? Aunt Falconer never likes to be\nkept waiting.\"\n\"Oh! I beg your pardon, Charlotte; I had forgotten you and I were to\nspend the day with mother; I will be ready in a few minutes.

She was older than Joyce, and still had never found the language\nof the eyes come to a good honest declaration of love, still less to an\noffer of marriage. She was just now on a visit to her cousin, Miss\nFalconer being very ready to spare her, hoping that in Clifton or\nBristol she might find a cure for her low spirits, and generally\ndejected air, which her aunt did not like to have remarked upon by the\ngossips of Wells, and which had certainly very much increased of late.",

Tell me, mother, who has been fighting?\"\n\"It was not a battle with swords or guns, Falcon; but when you are a man\nyou may remember that you heard, when you were a little boy, that on the\nnineteenth of September, eighteen hundred and thirty-one, the great\nReform Bill was carried by a number of votes.\"\n\"Then will all those angry people we saw when we came home from Fair\nAcres be happy and good now. Susan says they shouted 'Reform, Reform,'\nbecause they wanted bread; but I don't know what it means,\" said Falcon,\nthoughtfully. \"If it's a good thing, it ought to make people better,\noughn't it, Grannie?\"\nIt was profound philosophy for six years old! The necessary consequence\nof good must be something _better_.\nJoyce, thinking of those angry faces crowding round her and her babies,\nand of the one terrible face which conjured up such a host of dreadful\nmemories, sighed.\n\"Ah! Falcon,\" she said, \"good things cannot come all at once--good\nresults, I mean; but give me a kiss and run away, and mind you give\nGrannie no trouble while I am gone.\" Then Joyce turned for a moment into\nthe pretty sitting room which Mrs. Arundel occupied. Since Gratian's\nmarriage she had lived with her son and his wife. She had separate rooms\non the upper floor of the large house, and her own maid. The arrangement\nwas perfectly harmonious, and the little household was very happy.\n\"You will not mind letting the children dine with you, dear Grannie?\"\nJoyce said.\n\"Mind! it will be a great treat; do not hasten back.\"\n\"I thought after dinner, if Piers liked, we would go and see Mrs. More;\nhe does not get out enough.\"\n\"Take a carriage at my expense, dear, and drive to Windsor terrace, and\nthen over the Downs. It will be a lovely afternoon, and your mother will\nenjoy it.\"\nJoyce shook her head.\n\"I doubt if mother will come; but I will do my best, thank you.

Piers had made friends with the stone\ncutters who spread out their stalls on Sion Hill and at the foot of the\nObservatory, and there was a continual interest in getting specimens\nfrom them.\nPiers was helped in his studies by a young physician, who was then\nputting his foot on the first rung of the ladder which he soon scaled to\nthe very top, and stood in later years pre-eminently as the first\nconsulting physician of the West of England. His patients at this time,\nabove the level of Park Street were not very numerous, and he would\nlaughingly assure Piers that he was very proud to attend any one in so\naristocratic a locality as Down Cottage!\nHe lent Piers books and instruments, and gave him a microscope, of\nwhich, as a physician, he had several, and, indeed, was the bright\nelement in the lame boy's life.\nHe was coming out of the house now as Joyce opened the little iron gate,\nhis horse waiting for him at the corner.\nThe greeting between the doctor and Joyce was unusually warm; he admired\nher beautiful, beaming face, and always liked to exchange a word with\nher.\n\"It is great news,\" he said; \"though the crucial test is yet to come.\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said; \"but surely the dear old Lords will not obstruct the\nbill.\"\n\"The dear old Bishops will do so,\" the doctor said, \"your friend at\nWells amongst them.\"\n\"Well,\" Joyce said, \"he is sure to do what he does because he thinks it\nis right, not because other people do it.\"\nThe doctor laughed again; evidently he was not so sure of the Bishop.\nThen, with a pleasant smile to Charlotte, the doctor went away, just\nturning back for a moment to say, \"I saw your old friend, Mrs. Hannah\nMore's doctor, in consultation this morning, and he incidentally\nmentioned that she was failing rather visibly. Have you seen her of\nlate?\"\n\"I am going there this afternoon,\" Joyce said. \"I want so much to see\nher.\"\n\"I would not delay,\" the doctor said, significantly, and then he was\ngone.\nAfter the first greeting. Piers dragged Joyce off to his den, to show\nher a beautiful specimen of quartz, of which he had possessed himself\nthe day before for a mere trifle.\nAnd then he had diagrams to show her, which he had drawn, of several\ncrystals, as seen through the microscope; and then he divulged the\ndoctor's plan, that he should prepare a good many of such diagrams for\nhim to use at a lecture he was to give in the Bristol Museum, some\nevening in the course of the coming winter.",

She had sent the\nservants to bed; and Mrs. Arundel and Charlotte were also gone to their\nrooms; but Joyce sat up watching for Gilbert's return.\nThe baby Joy, was sleeping in her cradle, and Lettice and Lota in their\ncribs, while Falcon lay in profound repose, a fife, upon which he had\nbeen playing hard all day, as he marched round and round the garden, was\nclasped in his strong, round little fingers.\nJoyce bent over the children, shading the candle with her hand, to\nassure herself they slept, and then, leaving the nursery door open, that\nshe might hear if they stirred or cried, she went gently down the wide\nstaircase to the hall. The fire in the dining-room was burning low, and\nshe put on some more coal, and saw that the kettle just simmered on the\nhob, ready to be put on to the fire when Gilbert came.\nShe moved with that quiet, almost stealthy tread, which is common with\nthose who feel themselves the only persons awake in a house.\nThe stillness was broken by the ticking of the clock in the hall, and\nhow loud that tick sounded!\nJoyce went to the window, and, unfastening the shutter, looked out into\nthe night, a dark, murky night; and from below came the low murmur of\nthe crowds, which had not yet dispersed.\nPublic feeling throughout the country had reached almost to fever heat,\nbut in Bristol the animosity against Bishops and Lords, for the\nrejection of the Reform Bill which the Commons had passed, was quickened\nby the personal hatred, which the recorder, Sir Charles Wetherall had\nexcited amongst the people.\nBristol reformers were enraged that he should have made a bitter attack\nupon Lord John Russell in the House of Commons, charging him most\nunfairly with encouraging illegal means for carrying the Reform Bill.\nThough the whole country was in a ferment, and riots had broken out in\nDerby, Nottingham, and other towns, in no place was there such a\npersonal feeling excited as against the Recorder of Bristol.\nThe assizes would soon open, and vengeance was vowed against him, if he\nattempted to enter the city to perform his duties as a judge.\nBoth parties vied with each other in exciting bitterness and ill\nfeeling; and all good, moderate men felt, in their own minds, that a\ncrisis was at hand, and that, unless some wise and able pilot could be\nfound to guide the helm, a most disastrous shipwreck must follow.",

Gilbert had spoken several times at\nsome of the smaller meetings, and had advised temperance and patience.\nHe was one of the very few, in those days, who appealed to the working\nmen to help to maintain order among themselves; who showed the ruin and\ndistress the rioters had brought upon their families in other places,\nand who spoke to them as having common cause with himself to do all they\ncould to protect their wives and children. Gilbert was, in his heart,\nwhat was called a whig, but he was far, indeed, from being a hot-headed\nradical.\nThat he was known to be the grandson of a peer, and that his mother had\na title, did not win him favour with the extreme section of his own\nparty, while the others, perhaps, were a little triumphant that the son\nof a noble house might yet question the wisdom of the Lords in rejecting\na Bill which was so dear to the heart of the people.\nJoyce gently closed the shutters and returned to her place by the fire.\nThen she went out into the hall, where an oil lamp was dimly burning,\nand looked out from a small window by the side of the door.\nA sense of fear began to creep over her, not for herself, but for\nGilbert. She listened for his step with that nervous tension which is so\npainful, and of which we all know something.\nPresently the door of the cellar, which opened into the hall, creaked;\nJoyce watched it breathlessly; it opened wider and wider, and a man's\nhead appeared. In the dim light she could scarcely discern the features,\nbut something in that face was surely familiar.\nShe was not left long in doubt; once more Bob Friday stood before her.\nAt first Joyce was literally paralysed with terror, and she could\nneither speak, nor call for help.\nShe made a movement towards the door, but the man raised a hand to\nprevent her.\n\"Don't you scream or move. I want to speak to you.\"\n\"How can you--how dare you, come here?\"\n\"I came to tell ye that I'll see your young gent comes to no harm.\"\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Joyce, burying her face for a moment\nin her hands. \"I know--I know what terrible grief you once brought on me\nand all I loved.\"\nThe accents of her voice, with the sorrowful ring in them, the quiet\nself-possession, for which, with a sinking heart she struggled, touched\nthat rough, bad man, as no protestations or entreaties could have done.\n\"I cannot believe,\" she went on, \"you are come to do me more harm. My\nfour little children are asleep upstairs. There is no one in the house\nbut women, helpless women, one of whom is your own daughter--your _own\ndaughter_.\"\n\"I wouldn't hurt a hair of her head, nor yours, nor your childer's. I\ncame to warn you--the folks down below will stop at nothing once they\nare let loose; they'd as soon tear your young gent to pieces as look at\n'im. They'd fire this 'ouse for a trifle. I belong to a party of 'em,\nand if I know it, _he_ shan't come to no harm. Look ye, missus, I wanted\nto see you, to tell you the squire was riding peaceable enough----\"\n\"Oh! don't! don't! I cannot bear it,\" Joyce said.\n\"He was riding peaceable enough, and I laid in wait for 'im. I got hold\nof the bridle, and the horse, she backed and reared, and the squire he\nfell on a sharp stone, which cut his forehead--a three corner cut--I see\nit now. He lay like a dog, dead, and the horse galloped off, and\nI--well, I made off too, and got aboard a ship in Bristol Docks, and\nonly came back last Christmas. I meant to threaten the squire; but I\ndidn't kill 'im; I didn't _want_ to kill 'im.\"\n\"Your act killed him as much as if you had thrown the stone, as we all\nbelieved you did. Oh! I pray God may forgive you.\"\n\"Say you forgive me,\" the man muttered; \"I wouldn't hurt a hair of your\nhead.\"\n\"I pray God to forgive you, and I try to do as the Lord Jesus would have\nme, and forgive you. But, oh! leave your evil ways, and turn to Him.\"\n\"It's too late,\" he said.\n\"Oh! no! no!--never! never too late!\"\nThe man was silent for a few minutes; then he spoke in a low harsh\nvoice:\n\"Give my love to poor Sue. I broke her mother's heart, and I nearly\nbroke her's. I saw her riding in the carriage with you, like a lady, in\nthe spring. Her mother used to pray God to take care of her, and sure\nenough, He has. It must be pretty nigh like heaven to live along with\nyou. I'm a-going out by the way I came. Now you just see that the cellar\nwinder bars is mended; that's how I got in, and others may get in too. I\nsuppose you couldn't say, God bless you?\"\nThe restraint Joyce had put upon herself was very great, and now that\nthe danger seemed passing, she began to give way.\n\"Yes,\" she said faintly; \"I think you are sorry, and I say, may God\npardon you and bless you.\"\n\"Thank'ee,\" was the rejoinder; but still, though he moved back towards\nthe cellar door, he lingered.\n\"Suppose you wouldn't touch the likes of me with your little white hand?\nI'd like to feel it once, just once.\"\nWith a great effort she held out her hand, cold and trembling with fear.\nThe man took it up, as he would some curious and precious thing, and\nthen, bowing over it, he waited no longer, and the cellar-door closed\nbehind him.",

      "text": "Joyce sank upon one of the straight-backed chairs, and was just becoming\nunconscious of all outward things, when the latch-key was fitted into\nthe lock, and Gilbert came in.\nWith a cry of dismay, he closed the door, and hastened to take her in\nhis arms.\n\"My darling, what is it? What can have happened?\"\nHe carried her, half fainting, into the dining room, and chafed her cold\nhands, and held some water to her lips.\nA great flood of tears relieved her at last, and then clinging to her\nhusband's neck, and still shuddering in every limb, she managed to tell\nhim the story of Bob Priday's visit.\n\"It is a very grave matter,\" Gilbert said; \"if the man who is guilty of\nyour father's death is in Bristol, he ought to be apprehended and put on\nhis trial.\"\n\"He seems to bear us no ill-will now, Gilbert. He is penitent, I think;\nand he said dear father fell from the horse, and that he did not\nactually throw the stone at him. Oh! Gilbert, it seems to bring it all\nback again.\"\n\"Dismiss it from your thoughts to-night, my darling, we shall need all\nour strength and courage. I am sworn in as a special constable. The\npeople show increasingly signs of ill-will against those in authority.\nIf Wetherall persists in making a public entry into Bristol next week,\nGod only knows what will be the consequences. No one seems to be able to\ntake active measures. The mayor is kindly and well-intentioned, but he\nhas no strength of purpose, and if once the mob gets the upper hand,\nand those in authority are frightened, there will be a riot such as\nBristol has never known. I think, if things do not look more promising,\nI must send you to Abbot's Leigh with my mother and the babies, and\nCharlotte Benson had better go home. There is a house at Abbots Leigh,\nBenson, my partner, will let me have, and you would be out of harm's way\nthere.\"\n\"Oh! Gilbert, surely you do not mean that I am to leave you? I could\nnot--I will not leave you!\"\n\"You will do what I think is best and right, like a brave, good wife.\nYou would not add to my anxiety, I am sure. I have seen enough in\nBristol to-day to feel certain there will be a desperate struggle before\nthe city quiets down. Only imagine that man, Captain Claxton, being so\nmad as to call a meeting of sailors on board the two ships now in the\nharbour, the 'Charles' and the 'Earl of Liverpool,' under pretence of\nvoting a loyal address to the king, but really to get the sailors to\nform a guard to protect Wetherall when he enters Bristol. Could anything\nbe more likely to enrage the other party? The meeting was broken up and\nadjourned to the quay, where the anti-reformers passed the resolution in\na great uproar, protesting loyalty to the king, but declaring they will\nnot be made a cat's paw of by the corporation and paid agents. The\nnotion of protesting this publicly in the face of all the orders of the\nmayor! They are going to send a deputation to Wetherall to beg him not\nto persist in coming in next Saturday; but I am afraid it will be\nuseless. If anything could have added to my own share in the troubles of\nthe city, it is that Maythorne has chosen this time to come to the hotel\nin Clifton. He is a mere wreck, and so broken down that he looks like an\nold man instead of in his prime, but he is as bumptious as ever.\"\nJoyce had roused herself now. The idea of Gilbert's danger was enough to\ndrive away every other anxiety.\nShe made him take the refreshment which he so greatly needed, and,\nthough pale and exhausted, she felt it almost a relief to busy herself\nin any way which diverted her mind from the terrible half-hour she had\ngone through in the hall face to face with Bob Priday.\n\"Why is Maythorne's coming so vexatious to you?\" she asked; \"I mean,\nmore vexatious than usual.\"\n\"My dear child,\" Gilbert said, \"the very fact of his title, and my\nconnection with it, would be enough to ensure brickbats and stones to\nbe hurled at my head if he is seen with me. Let us hope he will keep to\nthe more aristocratic quarters of Clifton, and not come near us.\"\n\"I think,\" Joyce said, when at last they prepared to go upstairs to bed;\n\"I think I should like to hear you give God thanks for my safety, and\nthat strength was given me not to cry out or scream; but oh! Gilbert,\nGilbert, I _was_ so frightened!\"\nAgain he soothed her and comforted her, and then he raised his voice,\nthe manly tones touched with pathos, and thanked God for His mercy,\ncommitting his wife and her little children to His care.",

      "text": "All that week passed in dread and apprehension. The popular feeling grew\nstronger and stronger against the Recorder, as the head and chief, as\nfar as Bristol was concerned, of the anti-reformers.\nEfforts were made to postpone the assizes, or, in the phrase of the day,\n\"Deliver the gaol\"; but all their efforts were vain, and the authorities\nactually despatched a deputation to Lord Melbourne at the Home Office,\nto beg he would send down a body of soldiers to keep the peace during\nthe Recorder's visit. Lord Melbourne, doubting the expediency of such a\nmovement, tried to get at the opinions of the two members for Bristol.\nMr. Baillie was from home, but Mr. Protheroe said he would be answerable\nfor order, and himself accompany Sir Charles Wetherall, if the military\nwere dispensed with.\nThe idea of an armed force to protect a judge he considered\npreposterous, and more likely to inflame the people than anything else.\nIt was a memorable week to all those who lived in Bristol. And when the\nmorning of Saturday, October the twenty-ninth dawned, and the tramp of\nthe civic force was heard on their way to Totterdown to meet the\nRecorder, many hearts sank within them.\nLord Maythorne had found his way to Great George Street much oftener\nthan his sister, Mrs. Arundel, wished, or Gilbert expected. He took a\nvery lofty standpoint, and vowed that the Recorder was a fine fellow and\ndid what was right, and that he should like to see sacks full of the\nmalcontents thrown into the Float as an easy way of getting rid of them.\nGilbert found silence his safest course with his uncle, and tried to put\na restraint on himself when in his presence. He came up from Bristol\nabout four o'clock in the afternoon of this memorable Saturday, weary\nand dispirited, and found, to his dismay, that his uncle was in the\ndrawing-room.\nHe was lounging on a sofa, holding a skein of silk for Charlotte\nBenson's embroidery, affecting, at forty, the airs and manners of a\nyoung beau, and talking an immense deal of nonsense to poor Charlotte,\nwhich she was only too ready to drink in.\nCharlotte had begged to remain in Bristol at the early part of the week;\nand, as the days passed on, it became more and more difficult to think\nof leaving it. The mail coaches and passenger vans, as well as private\ncarriages, were continually stopped, and the travellers were roughly\nasked whether they were for Reform, or against it; for the Lords, or\nready to cry \"_Down with the Lords!_\"\nIn many instances quiet people, who cared very little about politics,\nand understood less, were seriously frightened, and even injured by the\nswift hurling of a stone or a brickbat.\nAs soon as Joyce heard her husband's step, she ran out to the hall.\nSusan Priday was also on the look-out, with Joy in her arms.\nGilbert looked worn out, and threw himself into a chair, saying:\n\"I believe it is all but impossible to avoid a riot now. I wish you and\nthe children and my mother were safe at Abbot's Leigh. Indeed, it is\nnot too late now to get you up to Down Cottage, and----\"\n[Illustration: High Street, Bristol.]\n\"I cannot leave you, Gilbert; do not ask me,\" Joyce said.\n\"Tell us what has happened in Bristol. We hear the uproar from these\nwindows,\" his mother said.\n\"Oh! let them fight it out,\" said Lord Maythorne, \"let them fight it\nout. They won't touch us.\"\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said Gilbert, sharply. \"I have a suspicion\nthat you, for one, would get rough handling if some of the malcontents\ncaught you.\"\nLord Maythorne laughed. \"I should like to see them try. But tell us the\nnews, pray.\"\n\"The news is,\" said Gilbert, \"that the plan of bringing in the Recorder\nearly in the day failed. We marched out about ten o'clock to Totterdown,\nin the hope of cheating the mob, who did not expect the procession till\nfour o'clock. The yells and hisses of two thousand people were a\nsufficient proof of this. The sheriff's carriage could scarcely make its\nway through the masses of people, and several stones were hurled at it.\nSir Charles Wetherall reached the Guildhall about twelve o'clock, and\nthe commission was read. It might have passed off fairly, had not that\nstupid though well meaning fellow, Ludlow, began to allude to Reform. It\nwas like a spark to tinder, and there was an instant uproar; amidst it\nthe court adjourned to eight o'clock on Monday morning. Every one means\nwell; but there is no leader for our body of special constables, and\nsome of the paid fellows are worse than useless. The Recorder is now at\nthe Mansion House in Queen's Square, and we were ordered to rest, but\nnot before several of our number were a good deal hurt, and in every\nencounter the mob had the best of it. They have armed themselves with\nsticks, and one poor fellow was chased into the Float, and many more\nmust have been hurt.\"\n\"Are you hurt, Gilbert?\"\n\"A few bruises, nothing worse; but it is imperative that the children\nand Susan should go up to Clifton Down. We are too near the city; if the\nMansion House is fired, as we hear is likely, the uproar and confusion\nwill reach this house. Charlotte and you, mother, the children and\nJoyce, must prepare to start at once. Make haste and pack up a few\nthings, and I will see you to a place of safety.\"\nAnd now swift steps were heard on the stairs, and Falcon came in.\n\"Father,\" he said, \"I've been watching from the windows, and I can see\nthe crowd, and the shouts get louder.\"\n\"You are to go with Susan, Grannie, and cousin Charlotte, at once, to\nDown Cottage. You will take care of mother, won't you, Falcon?\"\n\"Of course I will,\" the boy said, \"and of the baby, and Susan. Susan\ndoes nothing but cry. I wish she would not.\"\n\"It is not the time to cry, Falcon. We must all be as brave as we can.\nNow, Joyce,\" he said, \"and Charlotte, make haste.\"\n\"You are in a desperate hurry,\" Lord Maythorne exclaimed. \"I will look\nafter the ladies with pleasure, and I confess I see no great cause of\nalarm. You forget, Gilbert, that people have nerves.\"\nFor Charlotte began to sob hysterically, and ask 'if they would all be\nburned up, and if the dreadful people would rush up the hill.'\nLord Maythorne soothed her with honeyed words, and declared he would not\nleave her till she was in a place of safety.\n\"Gilbert,\" Joyce said, beseechingly, as she followed him to the dining\nroom, where he partook hastily of refreshment, \"do not force me to go\naway from you; let me and Falcon stay here. We have the gardener to\nprotect us, and the cook is a sensible woman. Pray please, let your\nmother take her maid and Susan, and, _do_ leave me here. Think how\ndreadful it would be to me to be beyond reach if--if anything happened\nto you, if you were hurt. Nay, Gilbert, do not refuse me.\"\n\"Well, I will yield for this one night, and to-morrow, being Sunday,\nthere may be peace; but I doubt it. Get the others under marching\norders; and, Joyce;\" as she was leaving the room, \"I am not very well\npleased to see my uncle hanging about here, and filling that poor girl's\nhead with nonsense. She is just as likely to fancy he is making love to\nher as not. Warn her, can't you?\"\nJoyce shook her head. \"It is not easy to persuade Charlotte that\neveryone is not ready to fall at her feet, and I am afraid she will\nresent any interference; but, oh!\" she continued gaily, \"I will do\nanything now I am not to be sent away from _you_.\"\nThen she hastened upstairs and found Susan and Mary bustling about for\ndeparture.\nJoyce told Falcon he was to stay to take care of her, and he shouted for\njoy. He had again taken up his post at the open nursery windows, leaning\nover the bars, and listening to the ever increasing tumult which reigned\nin the city below.\n\"Oh! dear madam,\" Susan said; \"I don't like to leave you.\"\n\"You like to please me, Susan, and there is no danger for me.\"\n\"The cellar window is made fast, I know,\" Susan said, \"and he--he can\nnever come near you again; but suppose the mob should come up here, and\nmaster not be able to reach you.\"\n\"That is not likely; by to-morrow all may be quiet, and I shall come to\nDown Cottage to see how you have got on. You must give mother my love,\nand tell her I know she will like to have Baby Joy to-night, and that\nyou can sleep with Lettice and Lota.\"\n\"Don't be afraid, my darlings,\" she said, as two little serious faces\nwere turned up to her, and two little plaintive voices said:\n\"We want to stay with mother. Falcon is going to stay.\"\n\"Falcon is a boy, and he likes to watch the crowds, and does not mind\nthe noise, and he is going to take care of me. Now then, darlings, run\ndown and tell father you are ready, while I go and see if grandmother\nand Mary, and cousin Charlotte are ready also.\"\nBut Mrs. Arundel had determined to remain with Joyce, and said nothing\nshould tempt her to leave her; her maid Mary should go, and she would\nstay behind.\nJoyce thought of the rather small accommodation at Down Cottage, and did\nnot raise any further objection. There was only Charlotte now to hasten.\nJoyce found her tying her bonnet and arranging her curls under it, and\nturning her head first to one side, then to the other, to catch a\nglimpse of her profile in the glass.\n\"Come, Charlotte, make haste,\" Joyce said; \"they are all ready.\"\n\"Is Lord Maythorne coming with us?\"\n\"Yes, as far as the Hotel. If I were you I should not desire his\ncompany.\"\n\"Oh! Joyce, he is very nice, quite delightful, and he is--\"\n\"He is given to flatter everybody,\" Joyce said, \"as years ago poor\nMelville found to his cost. So take care, Charlotte.\"\n\"Take care, indeed! I don't know what you mean,\" said Charlotte,\npouting. \"You always think no one can possibly admire _me_.\"\n\"My dear Charlotte, this is not a time for such nonsense, it is time to\ncommend ourselves and all we love to God's care, and not to be filled\nwith thoughts of who admires us and who does not. Lord Maythorne is\nGilbert's uncle; but he has caused a great deal of sorrow in the family,\nand we were all very sorry when he came to live in England again. Mrs.\nArundel cannot be uncivil to him, but she has not the slightest respect\nfor him; neither have I.\"\n\"Well, dear,\" said Charlotte, \"now you have finished your lecture, I\nwill go downstairs. I suppose you think, as you are--are married, you\nmay----\"\nCharlotte's ready tears began to flow, and Joyce, losing her patience,\npassed by her quickly, and ran down into the hall.\nIt was hard to bid them all \"good-bye,\" her baby smiling at her from\nunder her warm hood, Lettice and Lota clinging to her, and Susan looking\nback to the last moment, as she led the way down Great George Street\nwith Joy in her arms.",

Come up, mother.\"\n\"I am coming very soon, dear,\" she said.\nThen Joyce finished her inspection of the cellar, not without a thrill\nof remembered fear as she heard the creaking of the door, as it closed\nbehind her.\n\"You had better stay in the kitchen with cook, Henry, and be on the\nwatch till your master's return.

They tore up the iron\nrailings in front of the Mansion House, and hooted and scoffed at the\nRiot Act, which was read by the Mayor's order, and the force of special\nconstables was quite insufficient.\nGilbert saw this at once, and now, when the cry arose: \"Fire the Mansion\nHouse!\" it was a relief to see some action taken, by a troop of the 14th\nLight Dragoons, and Dragoon Guards trotting into the Square.\nThere was to all noble-hearted men, something terribly humiliating in\nthe aspect of affairs. Here was a seething, ignorant crowd of men,\nwomen, and boys, intimidating the magistrates, frightening the Mayor\ntill he actually barricaded his windows in the Mansion House with his\nbed; and Sir Charles Wetherall beating an undignified retreat from the\nflat roof of the dining-room. There, helped by a woman's hand, who set\nup a ladder for him, he dropped in pitiable terror into the stables\nbehind, and hid in a loft. Gilbert, standing on guard by the corner of\nthe Square with four friends bravely holding their ground, and warding\noff with their staves the excited crowd, recognised in the dim light the\nRecorder slipping by, in a post-boy's dress, which actually passed him\nthrough the crowd, till he found himself safe at Kingsdown. And if the\ncowardice of the Recorder, in escaping for dear life from the storm he\nhad himself roused was unprecedented, the wavering uncertainty of the\nColonel in command of the troops was scarcely less reprehensible!\nHow Gilbert longed to take a prominent part, and how his heart burned\nwith righteous indignation against the weakness and incapacity of those\nin command.",

The crowd passed over\nhim, and when it had cleared, Gilbert, himself feeble and exhausted,\nbent over the man, and tried to drag him nearer the houses.\nHe was bleeding profusely, and hailing a cart passing to the Infirmary\nwith two wounded men, Gilbert begged the driver in charge, to raise the\nprostrate man, and take him also to the Infirmary. It was no easy\nmatter, but at last it was accomplished, and a pair of dark, blood-shot\neyes were turned on Gilbert. The man tried to articulate, but no sound\ncame. As the cart was moving off, Gilbert saw he made a desperate\neffort.\nHe raised his hand, and cried out with all his remaining strength, \"Tell\nyour good lady I kept my word, and I saved you from harm!\"\n\"Stop!\" Gilbert said to the driver, \"stop; this man has saved my life. I\nmust come to the Infirmary to see he has proper care and attention.\"\n\"You look fit for a 'ospital bed yourself, sir,\" said the man. \"Jump up,\nand I'll take you for a consideration,\" he added, with a knowing twinkle\nof his eye.\nFaint and exhausted himself, Gilbert saw the wounded man placed in one\nof the wards with the others, whose condition was less serious, and,\nbending over the man, he said:\n\"I recognise you now. You are Bob Priday?\"\nThe man nodded assent.\n\"I've been a bad 'un,\" he said. \"I went in for these riots, 'cause I was\nsick of my life; but I'd like to see your good lady once more, and poor\nlittle Sue. Her mother used to reckon her next to a saint, as she sat\nlearning her hymns. I've scoffed and jeered at 'em, and sent the boys to\nthe bad, and threatened the squire. I did not kill him, though; and yet,\nwhat do you think, she, the squire's daughter, your good lady, bid _God\nbless me_, and let me touch her hand; why, ever since I've kinder felt\nthat if _she_ could pardon, God might.\"\n\"He _will_ pardon the chief of sinners, for Christ's sake,\" said\nGilbert.\nThe man's wound was bleeding profusely, and he soon became confused and\nwandering; and his face assumed a livid hue as Gilbert bent over him.\n\"My wife will not forget that you saved my life,\" he said; \"and I know\nif it is possible she will come and see you, and bring your daughter\nwith her.\"\n\"He is nearly unconscious,\" said the surgeon. \"Dear me! sir, what a time\nthis is for Bristol. This is the sixth case brought in since noon. God\nknows where the riots will end! You were sworn in as a special\nconstable, I suppose?\"\n\"Yes, but to little purpose. Resistance is useless, unless well\norganised.\"\n\"That's true enough; but there is no head, that's the mischief of it; no\nhead anywhere. Do you live in Bristol, sir?\"\n\"In Great George Street; I am returning there now. You will look after\nthis man?\"\n\"Yes; but he won't get over it. A bad subject--a very bad subject. He is\nvery prostrate,\" the surgeon continued, laying a professional finger on\nthe great muscular wrist; \"his hours are numbered. That's a bad blow on\nyour forehead, sir; let me put a bandage on; and how are you getting\nhome?\"\n\"As I came, I suppose. There seems a lull in the uproar now, and I shall\nbe able to get back by Trinity Street and up by Brandon Hill.\"",

Then\nher thoughts flew to the Infirmary ward, where Bob Priday lay dying, and\nshe felt determined that, if possible, Susan should see him, and she\nlaid her plans to effect this meeting.\nAs soon as Falcon woke, she lifted him from his bed and took him to the\nnursery, washing him and dressing him, and kneeling with him to say his\nmorning prayers; then she said to the boy:\n\"Falcon, grandmamma is asleep, and so is dear father. Dear father has\nbeen hurt by the rioters, and is to lie in bed very quiet all day. I\nwant to go up to Clifton to see the baby Joy, and Lettice and Lota. I\nshall leave you to watch by father, and if he stirs or wakes, call\ngrandmamma. Will you do this?\"\n\"Yes, mother,\" the boy said. Then with a sigh, \"I hope the riots are\nover now.

Are we to go to church, mother?\"\n\"If I can get back in time, darling, you shall go to church with Mary,\nbut I don't think I shall go to-day.\"\nThen she gave Falcon his basin of bread and milk, moving so gently that\nno one heard her lighting the nursery fire, and performing with her\naccustomed nicety all the little household duties which had been\nfamiliar to her from early childhood. Then she shared Falcon's breakfast\nwith him, gave him a volume of the old \"Children's Friend,\" with the\nfunny little woodcuts, which were the delight of the children of fifty\nyears ago; and, establishing him in the window-seat in his father's\nroom, left him on guard. It was beautiful to see how the noisy,\nhigh-spirited child, responded to his mother's hand, and felt a proud\nsense of serving her, as he was left in the room to take care of his\nfather.",

Come in, later in the day,\nand let us hear,\" Joyce said, as she parted from Mr. Bengough and walked\nquickly towards Clifton. All was quiet there, and when Joyce arrived at\nDown Cottage, her two little girls came flying to meet her, looking like\ntwo daisies, fresh from their morning bath.\nJoyce was struck with her mother's admirable management. She was always\nup with the lark in her old home at Fair Acres, and she kept up her\ncountry habits.\nThe breakfast was ready in the little dining-room, and everyone was\nthere but Charlotte. Piers had the baby Joy, upon his knee, and Mrs.\nFalcon declared she had been as \"good as gold\" all night.\nIt was hard to believe that Clifton Down Cottage could be so near to the\ntumultuous city; everything seemed going on as it did every day, and no\none appeared excited or troubled. When Joyce had told her story of the\nprevious night, however, the real state of affairs seemed brought home",

This boy, who was one day,\nto be foremost in the ranks of those who carried the standard of truth,\nand justice, and charity into the very thick of the conflict with the\npowers of darkness, thus spoke--long, long after most of those who had\ntaken any part in those three awful days were dead--to an audience who\nwere inhabitants of the city of Bristol, and to whom, therefore, the\nsubject was of especial interest. He said:\n\"I was a schoolboy in Clifton, up above Bristol. I had been hearing of\npolitical disturbances, even of riots, of which I understood nothing,\nand for which I cared nothing.\n\"But on one memorable Sunday afternoon I saw an object which was\ndistinctly not political. It was an afternoon of sullen, autumn rain.\nThe fog hung thick over the docks and lowlands. Glaring through the fog\nI saw a bright mass of flame, almost like a half-risen sun. That, I was\ntold, was the gate of the new gaol on fire; that the prisoners had been\nset free. The fog rolled slowly upwards. Dark figures, even at that\ngreat distance, were flitting to and fro across what seemed the mouth of\nthe fire.\n\"The flames increased, multiplied at one point after another, till by\nten o'clock that night one seemed to be looking down upon Dante's\nInferno, and to hear the multitudinous moan and wail of the lost\nspirits, surging to and fro amid the sea of fire.\n\"Right behind Brandon Hill rose the central mass of fire, till the\nlittle mound seemed converted into a volcano, from the peak of which the\nflame streamed up, not red above, but delicately green and blue, pale\nrose, and pearly white, while crimson sparks leapt and fell again in the\nmidst of that rainbow, not of hope, but of despair; and dull explosions\ndown below mingled with the roar of the mob, and the infernal hiss and\ncrackle of the flames.\n\"Higher and higher the fog was scorched upward by the fierce heat below,\nglowing through and through with red, reflected glare, till it arched\nitself into one vast dome of red-hot iron, fit roof for all the madness\nbelow; and beneath it, miles away, I could see the lonely tower of\nDundry Church shining red--the symbol of the old Faith--looking down in\nstately wonder and sorrow upon the fearful birth-throes of a new age.\"\n* * * * *",

I\nsuppose Charlotte Benson is gone home? The Wells coach is running\nagain.\"\nIn all the excitement of the past ten days, Joyce had really thought but\nlittle of Charlotte, and when her mother did not reply to the question\nat once, she said:\n\"What day did Charlotte go home?\"\n\"She is not gone home at all; you had better ask Piers about her.\"\n\"Is anything wrong?\" Joyce asked.\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Falconer, in her old blunt fashion, \"I believe\nCharlotte thinks everything is right, not wrong, but Piers is of a\ndifferent opinion. As for myself, I am no judge of lords and grand\nfolks, nor their ways neither. But Charlotte thinks she is going to be\n'my lady,' and that's about the truth.\"\n\"Mother!\" Joyce exclaimed; \"mother, it must be prevented; it is\nimpossible. How wrong we have all been to be so engrossed with our own\nconcerns and forget Charlotte's. I had really forgotten Lord Maythorne\nwas here. What will Mrs. Arundel say? Where is Piers?\"\nThe tap of Piers' crutches was now heard on the flag-stones before Down\nCottage, and he came in.\n\"I am glad you are come Joyce; it is time some one interfered. I have\njust been acting the spy on the Observatory Hill, and there are\nCharlotte and her elderly beau disporting themselves.\"\n\"Oh! Piers, it is really dreadful. I must tell Gilbert at once, and Mrs.\nArundel. It will worry Gilbert dreadfully, and he is still so weak.\"\n\"You need not look so doleful, Joyce; after all, if people will make\ntheir own bed of thorns, they must bear the prick when they lie down on\nit. It all comes of Aunt Letitia's silly bringing up. Charlotte has\nbeen made a foolish, sentimental woman, and this is the end of it.\"\n\"It must not be the end; I must do all I can to prevent it. Call Susan\nto bring Joy, and we will go home at once. I must consult Mrs. Arundel,\nand ask her what it is best to do.\"\n\"You won't have time, for here they come,\" Piers said.\nYes; there was Charlotte, with her head on one side, and evidently\nsimpering at some compliment, which her companion was administering.\nWhen they came into the sitting-room, and stood face to face with Joyce,\none betrayed some annoyance, and the other some triumph.\n\"I thought you would have gone home yesterday, Charlotte,\" Joyce said,\nafter the first greeting. \"Is not Aunt Letitia anxious to see you? This\nhouse is very full,\" she added, \"and Gilbert is not well enough for me\nto ask you to return to Great George Street.\"\n\"I am going to Wells to-morrow, dear,\" Charlotte said, \"and--and--\"\n\"I am to have the honour of escorting Miss Benson to Wells,\" Lord\nMaythorne said, in his honeyed accents.\n\"Indeed; I am sorry to hear it,\" Joyce said, sharply.\n\"I want to see my very old friend, now he is turned into a Benedict, at\nFair Acres, and who knows if I may not follow his example. I have known\nGratian, I may almost say, from childhood; I cannot profess to have that\nhonour with regard to you, fair niece.\"\nJoyce felt too angry to trust herself to reply, but she turned to\nCharlotte, and said:\n\"I want to speak to you, Charlotte, in Piers' room.\"\nJoyce's tone was one of command rather than of entreaty, and Charlotte\nfollowed meekly.\nAs soon as the door was shut, she said: \"Surely Charlotte, you are not\ngoing to travel to Wells alone with Lord Maythorne?\"\nCharlotte drew herself erect.\n\"Yes, I am. Why not? I am engaged to be married to him.\"\n\"Oh, Charlotte! it must not be thought of. Aunt Letitia will not allow\nit.\"\n\"Auntie not only allows it, but is quite pleased,\" Charlotte said.\n\"Some one must interfere. I cannot see you wilfully ruin the happiness\nof your whole life by such an act.\"\n\"That's just what he said,\" Charlotte exclaimed. \"He said he knew you\nwould make objections, because Gilbert has often meddled in his\nconcerns before; but that will not change me. If you--if\nyou\"--Charlotte broke down, and became tearful--\"had been so hungry for\nsomebody to care for you as I have been, and had known what it was to be\nslighted and looked down upon, you would not be so cruel. It is all very\nwell for _you_. But you never did care what became of poor me, and I--I\nused to love you so much, Joyce.\"\nCharlotte began to sob piteously, and Joyce felt she must appear\nhard-hearted, and take the consequences.\nJust as she had dispelled the vision of the raindrop which was to revive\nthe drooping rose many years ago, so now she must do her best to dispel\na far more dangerous illusion.\n\"Lord Maythorne is not a good man,\" she said; \"he is continually in\ndebt; he often plays high, and he has been living abroad all these years\nin what manner we hardly know. We believe that he came to Bristol now,\nsimply to get some money out of his sister, my mother-in-law. Surely,\nCharlotte, you must see that if you marry him you will be miserable.\"\n\"Gratian married Melville, and you prophesied the same then; and they\nare very happy.\"\n\"That is a very different case. Gratian is older, wiser, and stronger\nthan Melville, and keeps him right by the force of her own will.\nBesides, Melville was weak, and easily yielded to temptation; but he was\nnot like Lord Maythorne, who did his best to ruin him in his Oxford\ndays.\"\n\"He says--he says that is all a lie of Gilbert's.\"\n\"How dare you speak like that of my husband! A lie! As if he ever\nstooped to tell a lie.\" Joyce flushed angrily, and continued: \"You are a\npoor, weak, sentimental girl, not a girl, for you are nearly thirty, and\nif you do not know what is good for you, you must be taken care of. If\nmy little Lettice wished to eat anything that was poisonous I should\ntake it from her, and by the same rule I shall treat you.\"\n\"You have no right over me. Aunt Letitia knows, and _she_ approves, and\nexpects us to-morrow.\"\nBut Joyce did not give in one whit.\n\"Aunt Letitia must be enlightened then,\" she said, \"without loss of\ntime, and I shall take care that she knows the true character of the man\nto whom she thinks of entrusting you.\"\nCharlotte tried to rally herself, and began to laugh hysterically.\n\"You think so much of yourself, and that you are so wise, and that\nGilbert has made you just like himself, you both think yourselves so\ngood and perfect.\"\nJoyce told herself it was foolish as well as wrong to be angry with\nCharlotte, who was so unreasoning and feeble-minded.\nShe left her abruptly, called Susan and the baby, had many rapturous\nhugs from her little girls and Falcon and then kissing her mother, she\nbowed to Lord Maythorne, and departed.\nMrs. Arundel was greatly distressed when she heard Joyce's news, and\nthey consulted together what it was best to do.\n\"After all,\" Mrs. Arundel said, \"neither you nor I have any right over\nCharlotte. If she is warned, that is all we can do. If Miss Falconer\nconsents, she is her lawful guardian, and stands in the place of her\nmother.\"\n\"Shall we tell Gilbert?\"\n\"I think not, he cannot take any active part in the matter; Dr. Smith\nhas been here, and told me he did not think Gilbert would be able to\nreturn to the office for some time, that he had sustained a slight\nconcussion of the brain, and that we were to be careful not to worry him\nwith anything. He advises our making a move to Abbot's Leigh, to that\nhouse of Mr. Bayley's, as soon as we can arrange it, and Gilbert is able\nto bear the drive. He is very kind, and offered his carriage.\"\n\"That will be delightful,\" Joyce said; \"the trees are still beautiful in\ncolour, and oh! to be in the real country again with the children. If\nonly Charlotte were not so utterly foolish! I think I shall tell Gilbert\nquietly, when we are alone together; for he ought to know. Come, baby\nJoy, let us go and see dear father.\"\nGilbert turned his head towards the door as Joyce came in.\n\"Here is baby Joy come to kiss father,\" she said, dropping the baby down\ngently into her father's arms.\n\"Little Joy; well, she looks as sweet as ever--like her mother,\nwell-named. You have been away an age,\" he said; \"it's always like the\nsun going behind a cloud when you are gone.\"\n\"The sun is very grateful for the compliment,\" Joyce said, seating\nherself on a low stool by the sofa; \"and so is the little sun, isn't\nshe, baby?\"\nThe baby had possessed herself of her father's watch-chain, and was\nsucking it vigorously.\n\"I took Falcon to Grannie, because he made your head ache, and I brought\nback Joy, because she never could make anyone's head ache.\"\n\"Poor little Falcon! I am afraid I was very cantankerous this morning,\nbut that dreadful trumpet was rather too much. It is excessively stupid\nof me to be so long getting well; but, do you know, I am haunted with\nthose terrible scenes of last week, and, with the best intentions of\namusing me, Bayley came here and described the condition of Queen's\nSquare, and the charred bodies they found, one, the corpse of an old\nwoman, with a bit of red petticoat clinging to it. Ah! it is awful to\nthink of; and the cure for all this seems so far off.\"\n\"It will come at last,\" Joyce said, with quiet decision.\n\"Yes, when the whole nation wakes up to see the needs of the poor. We\ndon't help them, nor try to raise them out of their ignorance of the\ncommonest laws of humanity. We have been wholly neglectful of their\nsouls and bodies, and then when they are heated by drink, and let loose\ntheir fury against some grievance, like the entrance of the Anti-Reform\nRecorder into Bristol, we hunt them down, trample them under foot, and\nnever look below the surface to find out what is the bitter root, from\nwhich all this springs.\"\n\"_You_ look below the surface, dearest; but don't go over it all now; I\nhave a piece of news to tell you, which has made me very angry.\nCharlotte Benson says she is engaged to marry your uncle. Can anything\nbe done?\"\n\"Write at once to aunt Letitia to stop it.\"\n\"That is the most extraordinary part of the whole affair; she does not\ndisapprove it.\"\n\"She must be mad!\" said Gilbert, shortly; \"what does my mother say?\"\n\"She is afraid of exciting you about it; but she is very much\ndisturbed.\"\n\"She may well be. He must be looking after your aunt's money.\"\n\"Shall I write to Aunt Letitia?\"\n\"Yes; I only wish I were well, and not laid on the shelf like this, and\nI would go to Wells to-morrow.\"\n\"I thought of writing to Gratian and Ralph, and Harry is still at Fair\nAcres. Aunt Letitia thinks a great deal of what Gratian says.\"\n\"Better write to Aunt Letitia, and I will tell you what to say. Get my\nmother to write also, and surely you have been honest with the girl?\"\n\"Very honest indeed,\" Joyce said, laughing; \"a little too honest!\"\nThe letter was dictated and posted, with one from Mrs. Arundel. Postage\nwas an object in those days, so that the two letters went under one\ncover, carefully sealed by Gilbert's hand.\nFor some days there was silence, and no one knew what turn events had\ntaken, and there was no answer to the letters.\nA week passed, and then came a letter from Charlotte herself.\n\"MY DEAR JOYCE,--You will see by the date of this letter I am at\nBath. I was married to dear Lord Maythorne yesterday. He wished for\na very quiet wedding, and he had a special license, and the\nceremony was performed at St. Cuthbert's. Dear auntie was present,\nand dear Gratian and Melville came in from Fair Acres. We went to\nthe 'Swan,' and had an elegant breakfast, and then we posted here.\nIt is very strange to me to feel I am Lady Maythorne; but with such\na _dear_, _kind_, delightful husband, I ought to be happy. Pray\naccept kind love from us both.\n\"Your truly affectionate cousin,\n\"CHARLOTTE MAYTHORNE.\n\"Pulteney Street, Bath,",

There is Ralph working hard and enduring a good deal at the\nold home, while I----\"\n\"You are not unhappy, dear?\" Joyce asked, anxiously.\n\"No,\" he said; but the \"No\" was not heartily said. \"After all, we think\ntoo much of ourselves and all our little concerns. Why, Joyce, what are\nwe and this earth we live in, when compared to that great universe of\nwhich these stars, as they come out one by one, seem to bring a nightly\nmessage? What are we, to think so much of ourselves? and what are life,\nand death, and troubles, and joys, and petty disappointments? They are\nnothing--lighter than dust in the balance.\"\n\"They are something to God,\" Joyce said, reverently. \"He has told us so.\nDearest Piers, you are not losing that Faith which we used to call our\nstaff in the dear old days.\"\nPiers was silent for a moment.\n\"Joyce,\" he said, at last, \"I like to talk to you sometimes. I sit and\nread in my den, and go out and in of the sitting room and see how mother\nis getting on, and my brain gets full of cobwebs and I am impatient, and\nlong to spring up into a better and nobler life, and yet I am tied down.\nDon't you think I did not feel my miserable weakness when I heard of\nGilbert, in the thick of the rioters, saving a woman and child, and\nbravely doing his best in the face of the weakness and incompetence of\nthose about him? I felt as if I would have given something to get a hard\nthump on my head in such a cause, the cause of humanity.\"\n\"Piers, you are dull at home, I know, but you have the delightful young\ndoctor for a friend.\"\n\"Yes; but I can't sham illness to get him to come; he is a long way off.\nBut I am doing some more diagrams for his lecture on Fungi.\"\n\"I am so glad; and Piers, when Gilbert can really afford it, we are\ngoing to have a house in the country, and call it 'The Haven,' and you\nand mother shall come and live with us, and you shall help me to teach\nFalcon, and we shall be so happy.\"\n\"Ah! that is looking a long way forward, Joyce. Perhaps my haven will be\nhere, under the shadow of this old church, before then. But I feel the\nbetter already for being with you, old Joyce; you are just the same as\nyou ever were.\"\nThe brother and sister exchanged a kiss, and then, in the silence of\nperfect sympathy and affection, walked back to the house.",

In the pause--that solemn pause before the\nclock strikes twelve, and the knell for the dying year is followed by a\ngreat rejoicing peal for that which is new born--Gilbert Arundel read,\nin slow, clear tones, that wonderful Psalm which ever seems to be so\nfraught with wisdom, and to express so well the yearning of the human\nsoul for something, which as the generations roll by, and pass like a\ntale that is told, remains steadfast and immoveable.\nLord, _thou_ hast been our Refuge; and, notwithstanding the storms and\nthe troubles of this short and mutable life, faithful hearts like\nJoyce's can add, in trusting confidence, \"and _wilt_ be to the end.\"\n* * * * *\nAn hour later, when the last chimes had rung out from every belfry tower\nfrom far and near, and the fair young year lay calm and beautiful\nbeneath the stars, husband and wife went together to the long, low\nnursery, where the three elder children lay in profound slumber. The\nkiss and blessing did not disturb Lettice or Lota, but the \"Happy new\nyear, darling,\" brought Falcon to a state of half consciousness.\n\"Happy new year, mother--father,\" he murmured, with an added word which\nsounded like \"my trumpet.\"\n\"That beloved trumpet,\" said Joyce, laughing. \"I let him take it out\ninto the garden after dinner, and give one great blow; but he was so\nloyal, he came and hid it again, out of sight, saying, 'If father heard\nthat, it was only just _once_.'\"\n\"Dear old boy!\" Gilbert said. \"I shall not forget his self-denial\nlearned from his mother.\"\n\"Nay,\" she said, playfully, \"I do not quite wish to blow trumpets.\"\n\"Not your own, certainly,\" was the quiet rejoinder.\nThey did not forget baby Joy. Her cradle was in their own room; and\nJoyce called her husband to look at her, and wish her the \"happy new\nyear,\" as he had wished the others.\n\"A happy new year to my little Joy,\" he said.\nThe baby moved a little, and, throwing one fat arm behind her head, a\nflickering smile played over her face, a light rather than a smile, such\nas comes over the faces of the little ones sometimes when in sleep,\ntheir angels draw near.\nIt was one of those supreme moments in life, which do not find\nexpression in many words:--\n\"A happy new year to you, my little Joy,\" Joyce repeated, and then there\nwas silence, while--\n\"Two faces o'er the cradle bent,\nTwo hands above the head were locked,\nThese pressed each other while they rocked,\nThose watched a life that Love had sent.\nO solemn hour!\nO hidden power!\"\nTHE END",
