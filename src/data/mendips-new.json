            "text": "As the sun threw its level beams from the east across the lawn,\nthousands of diamond drops sparkled and shimmered in the light, and it\ntouched with radiance the figure of a young girl who was standing by a\nwhite gate which led into a copse sloping upward to the crest of a hill,\nbehind the old manor, and crowned by a belt of fir-trees.\nJoyce had her hand on the latch of the gate, but paused for a moment to\nlook back on the landscape which lay stretched out before her.\nA peaceful valley was below, where the tower of Fair Acres church rose\nagainst a background of trees, now in their first fresh beauty. A few\ncottages with red roofs clustered round the church, and two or three\nfarms were sprinkled at a farther distance. A rugged outline of hills at\na higher level, showed where the Ebbor rocks open out a miniature\nCheddar, and on the other side of that little gorge lay the open\ncountry, where the city of the deep springs lies, with its noble\ncathedral, and quaint Close, and stately baronial Palace--the beautiful\ncathedral village of Wells.\nJoyce Falconer was looking forth upon life as upon this goodly\nlandscape. She was in the fresh spring-time of seventeen summers. Her\nfather called her Sunshine, and her brothers Birdie; while her mother,\nwho was a plain, practical person, and who indulged in no flights of\nfancy, would say, \"Joyce is the child's name; and what can suit her\nbetter? I don't like nick-names.\"\nNevertheless the nick-names held their own, and as Joyce stood by the\nwhite gate, a voice was heard resounding from the lawn below:\n\"Hallo, Sunshine!\"\n\"Father, come up the hill. It is so lovely this morning.\"\nThe squire advanced with steady, even footsteps. He was a fine, stalwart\nman, dressed in a stout suit of corduroy, and with leggings buttoned up\nto his knees. He carried a gun under his arm--more from habit than from\nany idea of using it just then--and close at his heels walked, with\nsedate and leisurely bearing, his chief friend and companion, a large\nretriever, Duke; while two little terriers, Nip and Pip, bustled about\nin every direction, scenting with their sharp noses, and occasionally\nturning upon each other to have a playful passage of arms which, though\naccompanied by ominous growls, meant nothing but fun.\n\"I am up first to-day, daddy!\" Joyce exclaimed, as she went down the\ngentle descent and linked her arm in her father's. \"I am first, and is\nnot it beautiful to be alive on such a day?\"\nThe squire paused, and putting his arm round his daughter's waist, he\nsaid, looking down at her with eyes of loving pride:\n\"Beautiful! yes,\" thinking, though he did not say so, that the most\nbeautiful thing in all that beautiful world was his little Sunshine, his\ndarling Joyce.\n\"I hope the weather will keep fine for the hay,\" he said; \"but the glass\nwent up with a gallop yesterday; still, it looks fair enough this\nmorning.\"\n\"When are we to begin to cut the grass, daddy?\"\n\"To-morrow, in the home meadow,\" was the reply. \"I am going into Wells\nto-day, for the magistrates' meeting.\"\n\"May I come, father?\"\n\"Well, I've no objection, if mother has not,\" was the answer. \"You must\nask her leave.\"\n\"I expect she will let me come. She is sure to have some shopping to do;\nand you don't like commissions at shops, daddy.\"\nThe squire gave a significant shrug of his broad shoulders, and then the\ntwo began to thread their way through the copse, and came out at last on\nthe side of the grass-covered hill, up which Joyce skipped with the\nlight step of a young fawn, with Nip and Pip scuffling along with her in\nthe highest glee, while the squire and Duke followed more slowly.",

Here, rummage in my\npocket, left-hand side--there he is! He is a perfect specimen, and a\npretty rare one. The stable-boy found him lying on his back under the\ndove-cot. Perhaps he got the worst of it in a fight. Anyhow, he is dead,\nand I have a nice nook for him in my big case.\"\n\"Poor dear little birdie,\" Joyce said, stroking the soft feathers. \"Oh!\nPiers, why must everything die? It seems so hard. And this is the\npuzzle, that we--you and I--may die to-day, next week, any day; and yet\nwe don't really behave as if we believed it. I feel on a morning like\nthis, for instance, so full of life, it is so delicious to live, and as\nif I never could die. It is so beautiful to be living, so sad to be\ndead! To think, Piers, of this little bird singing sweetly----\"\n\"Sparrow-hawks don't sing very sweetly; they chirrup and whistle,\" Piers\ninterrupted.\n\"Ah, well, he thought he sang sweetly, and so did his mother; so it came\nto the same thing. Poor little sweet.\" And Joyce held the little\nlifeless bird against her rounded chin and pressed her lips upon it.\nSuddenly Piers said:\n\"What is wrong about Melville; there's something fresh, for I heard my\nmother talking about it before I was up.\"\n\"He says he won't come here and take care of the farm. He wants to\ntravel.\"\n\"Well, I don't blame him for that,\" said Piers.\n\"But his debts have hampered father dreadfully I know, and he does so\ndetest his fine gentleman airs. It seems to me,\" said Joyce, vehemently,\n\"to be ashamed of a father like ours is--Oh! I have no word bad enough,\nand Melville _is_ ashamed, and he does not like mother looking after the\ndairy and the butter.\"\n\"Well,\" said Piers, tapping his crutch upon the ground, \"I think mother\ndoes fidget and worry too much in the house and about the place; but it\nis her way, and no one could alter it.\"\n\"I don't know that I wish to alter it,\" Joyce said, hotly. \"Mother has\ndone so much for us, and I hate to think she is slighted by her\nchildren. Melville _does_ slight her, and when he talks in that\ndrawling, affected voice, and ties his starched cravats twenty times,\nand flings them down again if the bow is crooked. I despise _him_, and\nthat is the truth.\"\nPiers shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Well, we must go back to breakfast,\" he said; \"I am hungry, and it must\nbe nearly eight o'clock.\"\nThe brother and sister walked slowly towards the house, and as they",

            "text": "breakfast, laid in a large, cool hall at the back of the manor, which\nwas connected, by a square opening in the thick wall, with the kitchen.\nThe squire, who was generally so jovial and cheery, ate his cold pressed\nbeef and drank his glass of \"home-brew\" in silence. He professed to be\nengrossed with a Bath paper several days old, and did not invite\nconversation.\nPiers played with some bread-and-milk his mother set before him: his\nappetite was never good; but Joyce despatched hot rolls and ham with a\ngreat appetite, which I am afraid would shock some of our modern notions\nnowadays.\nTea and coffee were not the staple beverages at breakfast in those\ntimes; but when the heavier part of the meal was over Joyce handed her\nfather a fragrant cup, with some thin toast done to a turn, for which\nMrs. Falconer called from the kitchen through the window, communicating\nwith it, and fitted with a sliding shutter, which was promptly closed\nwhen the tray had been received from the hands of one of the maids.\n\"So you are thinking of going into Wells to-day, Arthur?\" Mrs. Falconer\nsaid when, breakfast drawing to a conclusion, she began to pile the\nplates together, and put all the scraps on one, for the benefit of Nip\nand Pip, who had been lying in the window-seat for the past half-hour in\na state of suppressed excitement, with their noses on their paws, and\ntheir eyes fixed upon that end of the table where their mistress\npresided.\nThe noise made by the piling up of the plates was now a decided\nmovement, and Nip and Pip began to wriggle and leap, and finally subside\non their hind legs as Joyce called out: \"Trust, Nip! trust, Pip!\" and\nthen, after what she considered a due time spent in an erect position,\nthe plate was put down before them, and its contents vanished in a\ntwinkling.\n\"Well, Joyce, will you be ready by eleven o'clock?\" Mr. Falconer asked\nas he left the room.\nJoyce was silent, and her mother said:\n\"Yes, yes, she shall be ready; if she is brisk she can get through all I\nwant.\" Then Mrs. Falconer began to put all the silver into a wooden\nbowl, and rubbed it herself with the washleather when it was dried.\nShe had just finished this part of her daily routine when the door\nopened and her son Melville came in. His appearance would be ridiculous\nin the eyes of the dandies of to-day, but in his own, at least, it was\nas near perfection as possible.\nHis hair was curled in tight and very-much-oiled curls on his forehead\nand round his ears. He wore a high neckcloth, tied evidently with much\ncare, supporting his retreating chin. His coat was of Lincoln green,\nvery short in the waist, with large silver buttons, and turned back with\na wide collar to display two waistcoats, the white one only showing an\nedge beyond the darker one of deep salmon-colour, which opened to set\noff a frilled shirt. The trousers were tight, and caught at the ankles\nby straps, and his shoes were tied with large bows. The servile\nimitators of \"the first gentleman in Europe\" followed in his steps with\nas much precision as possible, and Melville Falconer spared no pains to\nlet the county folk of Somersetshire see what the real scion of _bon\nton_ looked like.\nMelville had a pleasant, weak face; he was almost entirely forgetful of\nthe interests or tastes of anyone but himself, and he had never given up\nhis own wishes for the sake of another in his life.\nHe had a ridiculous idea of his own importance, and a supreme contempt\nfor what he called old-fashioned usage; from the vantage-ground of\nsuperior wisdom he looked down on the county gentry of Somersetshire,\nwho, in those days, did not frequent London in the season, or tread hard\non the heels of the nobility in all their customs, as is now the case.\nThe great mercantile wealth which rose into colossal importance, when\nrailway traffic brought the small towns near the large ones, and the\nlarge ones near the metropolis, had not begun to overshadow the land;\nthe tide of speculation had not set in; and there was less hastening to\nbe rich and desire to display all that riches could give. It was a time\nof comparative stagnation, which preceded the great rush, which was to\nbear on its tide, as the stream of progress and discovery gathered\nstrength, the next generation with relentless power. Of all that lay\noutside Fair Acres, Mrs. Falconer was almost indifferent, if not\nignorant. She liked things as they were, and was averse to change, lest\nthat change should be for the worse. Her tongue, which was a sharp one,\nhad been swift to condemn the establishment of the schools in her\nneighbourhood, and she resisted all invitations from her husband to make\nthe acquaintance of Mrs. Hannah More. Teaching lads and lasses to read\nand write was, in the opinion of Mrs. Falconer, a crying evil. They had\nenough learning if they kept their church once a week, and as to\narithmetic, if they could count their own fingers it was enough; and\nshe, for one, would never take a servant who had schooling. \"A pack of\nnonsense,\" she called it; and she would tell Mrs. Hannah More so if only\nshe had the chance. Mrs. Falconer turned from her occupation at the\ntable, when her son entered.\n\"Breakfast!\" she exclaimed. \"No, indeed; breakfast is over and done\nwith. I can't keep the things about half the morning.\"\nThe prototype of the fine gentleman seated himself in a chair at the\ntable, and said in a drawling voice, suppressing a yawn:\n\"Joyce, get me some clean plates, and go and order a rasher of bacon;\nand let the eggs be poached; and----\"\nBut Mrs. Falconer pushed Joyce aside:\n\"No,\" she said; \"your sister has something else to do than wait on you.\nI'll get your breakfast; and if you have to wait an hour, it will serve\nyou right; lie-a-beds don't generally have sharp appetites.\"\n\"Nay, mother,\" Melville said, \"do not let the want of appetite be laid\nto my door, with so many other sins; I am particularly hungry this\nmorning. And I beseech you, do not do servant's work for _me_.\"\nMrs. Falconer's face betrayed that she felt the thrust.\n\"Servant's work must be done for folks too lazy to do it for\nthemselves,\" she said, as she let the heavy door swing behind her, and\nrepaired to the kitchen to prepare, far too carefully, a breakfast for\nher son.\nJoyce hesitated a moment, and then said:\n\"It always vexes mother when you are late, Melville. I wish you would\nget up earlier.\"\n\"My dear little sister, I should have vexed mother if I had come down at\nsix. She is out of temper with me, and so is my father, simply because I\ndesire to get a little education, to fit me for my position here, you\nknow, when I come into the place.\"\n\"Oh, Melville, you have had every advantage; you ought to know\neverything. But Aunt Letitia was quite right--the money spent upon you\nat Oxford was wasted.\"\n\"Thanks for your high opinion. I ought to be vastly grateful for it. But\nto speak of other things: I have bidden a friend to stay here for a\nweek. He will like country air, and to drink milk and curds-and-whey. He\narrives at Wells by the Bath mail; and I shall drive in with you and my\nfather, and hire a post-chaise at the Swan to bring him out.\"\n\"I hope he is not a fine gentleman,\" Joyce said.\n\"He is a very fine gentleman indeed,\" was the answer; \"and, Joyce,\npersuade mother _not_ to put on that big bib, and make herself look like\na housekeeper. It will appal Arundel, and make him feel out of his\nelement.\"\n\"If he is to feel that, what does he come for?\" Joyce said, angrily. \"We\nwant no upstarts here.\"\n\"Upstarts! that is fine talking. Arundel comes of one of the oldest\nfamilies in England. Not older than ours; though, unhappily, we live as\nif we had sprung from the gutter, and do not get any proper respect.\"\n\"Respect!\" exclaimed Joyce, indignantly. \"Respect! As if father were not\nrespected as a justice! and as if _you_----\" Joyce stopped; she felt too\nindignant to go on.\n\"My dear little sister,\" Melville said, with a grand air of pity--\"my\ndear little sister, you are only ignorant. If you knew a little more of\nthe habits and customs of the higher classes, you would not talk so\nfoolishly.\"\n\"I do not wish to know more about them if you have got _your_ habits\nfrom associating with them.\"\nMelville smiled, and did not betray the least irritation.\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"facts are stubborn things. Does it never strike\nyou, that though my father dines at the houses of the gentry in the\ncounty, sits on the bench, and rides to cover, you and my mother are not\ninvited to accompany him. The truth is my good mother dislikes the\nusages of _genteel_ life.\"\nMelville used that objectionable word with emphasis. Genteel was in\nthose days used as some of us now use words which are scarcely more\nsignificant, though generally accepted--\"Good form,\" \"A 1,\" and so\nforth.\n\"It is,\" Melville continued, grandly, \"the result of early associations;\nand so we eat heavy one o'clock meals and nine o'clock suppers, instead\nof dining at three or four o'clock; and my mother, instead of receiving\ncompany in the house, works in it like a servant. It is a vast pity, my\ndear. It keeps the family down, and destroys your chances in life. So I\nadvise you to try to alter things. Now Arundel is coming, I want to dine\nat a less outlandish hour, and I----\"\nWhatever Mr. Melville Falconer wanted Joyce did not stay to hear. She\nleft the large hall by one door as her mother entered by the other,\nbearing in her hand a tray of delicately prepared breakfast for her\nson, who was wholly unworthy of her attentions, and would have been\nbetter without them.\n\"Thank you, mother,\" Melville said. \"I hope the toast is not dried up.\nThere is so much skill even in the poaching of an egg.\"\n\"There are two ways of doing everything,\" was Mrs. Falconer's rejoinder.\n\"Now I must be quick, for I have a deal of work upstairs.\"\n\"Why should you have work, mother?\"\n\"Why did you invite a fine gentleman here? You had better answer that\nquestion. The best room must be got ready, and the feather bed laid\nbefore the fire.\"\n\"A fire in this weather!\" exclaimed Melville.\n\"No one ever sleeps in my house in an unaired bed; and never will, while\nI am mistress of it, that I can tell you. I hope your fine gentleman is\nnot one to scoff at plain people.\"\n\"Arundel is far too well bred to make invidious remarks. But for all\nthat, things may strike him as a little odd. I was going to suggest that\nwe should dine at four o'clock while he is here, and that the boys\nshould not sit down with us elders. It is not the custom in great\nhouses.\"\n\"It is the custom here, and mine is _not_ a great house: it is a\ncomfortable English home, where there is no waste, and no extravagance,\nand no show. I'll warrant your grand friend never slept in a better bed\nnor between finer sheets than he will to-night. They are as sweet as\nlavender can make them, and----\"\nMelville shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Nay, spare me, mother, and let us leave the arrangements of\nbed-chambers to the fitting people. And, if I might suggest it, let all\nthings wear their best appearance when Arundel arrives, including the\nmistress of the mansion. It is a pity when one so young and\ncomely-looking as my mother should pay such scant heed to the little\nfeminine ornaments which are----Phaugh! what is this? Positively a red\nant crawling from the bread-trencher. What a beast! Quick! catch it,\nmother. I hope we shall have no red ants when Arundel is here.\"\nMrs. Falconer darted down upon the ant with her forefinger, and speedily\ndespatched it, exclaiming there was a perfect plague of ants in the\nlarder, and she did not know how to be rid of them.\n\"Disgusting!\" said her son, carefully covering the body of the ant with\na leaf which had garnished the pat of butter. \"It is enough to make one\nsick. I must have a little brandy to settle myself, or rather, my\nbreakfast, before I start.\"\nMrs. Falconer made no response to this request. But the spirit-stand was\nin the sideboard, and when his mother was gone Melville helped himself\nto a pretty strong dram, and then lounged about till it was time to\nmount the \"four-wheel\" and drive into Wells.",

The landlord came\nbriskly to the side of the vehicle to assist Miss Joyce to alight, while\nthe ostler and stable-boy ran to the head of the mare; and in the dark\nentrance below the portico the landlady and a waiter with a napkin over\nhis arm, were in readiness.\n\"Good-day to you,\" said the squire, in a cheery voice.\n\"We are proud to see you, sir. Nice weather for the hay. Will you please\nto walk in, sir? and Mrs. Maltby will receive your orders for dinner.\"\n\"Thank ye kindly. Dinner for two at one o'clock. My daughter will go up\nto the Liberty, to her aunt's.\"\n\"Here, you fellow,\" exclaimed the prototype of the first gentleman in\nEurope. \"Here, can't you get the carriage nearer the pavement? I don't\ncare to set my foot in that puddle.\"\nThe ostler backed the horse, and the landlord advanced to give Melville\nhis arm, while a knot of people had assembled in Saddler Street,\nwatching with some curiosity the movements of the smart young gentleman\nin the back seat.\nThe squire, provoked at the tone in which his son had spoken, vanished\nwithin the dark lobby of the inn, while Joyce said, laughing:\n\"Melville, surely you don't want to be helped from the carriage!\"\n\"Look at 'im, now,\" said a poor woman, who was carrying a basket of\nvegetables to one of the Canon's houses; \"did ye ever see the like? His\nshoes are made of paper; and, lor! what bows!\"\n\"Take care; you'll be heerd,\" said an old man, who was leaning on his\nstick. \"Take care. Don't 'ee chatter like a magpie. You'll be heerd,\nPeggy Loxley.\"\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed the woman, \"I know why you are affrighted; I know.\nYou've got your 'nephy' up to-day afore the justices, and you don't want\nto affront one of the justices; I see.\"\nThe old man shook his stick at the woman, and meantime Melville had\naccomplished his descent without splashing his shoes or the edge of his\ntrowsers.",

There were no jarring\nsounds of wheels, no tread of many feet, no traffic which could tell of\ntrade. Although it was high noontide, the stillness was profound: the\njackdaw's cry, the distant voices of children in the market-square, the\nrustle of the leaves in the trees, and a faint murmur of tinkling water,\nonly seemed to make the quiet more quiet, the silence more complete.\nThe great west door was open, and Joyce walked towards it, and passed\nunder it into the cool shadows of the nave. She had often done this\nbefore, going out from the north porch into the Close again, but to-day\nthere seemed, she scarcely knew why, the stirring of a new life within\nher.\n[Illustration: Wells Cathedral.]\nIt was the moment, perhaps, of crossing the barrier which divides\nchildhood from womanhood; the pause which comes in most young lives,\nwhen there is, as it were, a hush before the dawn of the coming day.",

The\nVicar's Close, at the further end, is closed in by a small chapel, which\nentirely blocks the entrance, for any but foot passengers, who obtain\negress into the North Liberty by some uneven stone steps at the side of\nthe chapel, leading into the road a few feet above the level of the\nClose.\nIf Wells is quiet outside the Vicar's Close, it is quiet indeed within\nit. Since the summer day when Joyce went into the little garden before a\nhouse half-way up on the right side, the hand of the modern Wells\nbuilder and plasterer may have marred the complete effect, with stucco\nand sash-windows; but for the most part the houses in the second decade\nof the century were guiltless of plate glass and white-wash, and their\nantique frontage was, even more than now, one of the most picturesque\nfeatures of the city of Wells.\nJoyce had scarcely touched the bright brass handle of the bell when the\ndoor opened, and a girl of two or three and twenty sprang out.\n\"Oh, Joyce, how glad I am to see you! Come in Aunt Letitia, here is\nJoyce.\"\nMiss Falconer was in the parlour on the right-hand side of the little,\nlow-roofed lobby, and rose somewhat feebly from her chair by the wide\ngrate, which was gay with pots of flowers and evergreens.\n\"Well, my child, welcome. Have you come to Wells with your father?\"\n\"Yes, auntie; and I am come here for dinner, and after dinner may\nCharlotte come and do some shopping with me? I have a long list of\ncommissions at the china shop and at Wilmott's.\"\n\"Charlotte will be pleased to accompany you, dear child; and when you\nhave taken off your bonnet, come and tell me home news.\"\nThere were not many stairs to ascend to Charlotte's bedroom, which\nlooked into the gardens at the back of two other houses of some\npretension, between the Vicar's Close and the Deanery.\nCharlotte curled herself up in the deep window-seat, and watched her\ncousin as she laid aside her large bonnet, smoothed her hair, and\narranged her white pelerine over her pelisse. Charlotte had a genuine,\nif rather romantic, admiration for her cousin Joyce. Though a good girl,\nshe was somewhat given to sentiment and languishing, complained of being\nfatigued, of headaches, and low spirits. She fed upon romance and\npoetry--the poetry of albums and keepsakes, which was then\nfashionable. Of course she had a hero who figured in her day-dreams; and\nshe would spend hours at the little window of the sitting-room to catch\na sight of him as he passed along the Close. Charlotte would have been\nmuch better for some active employment; but Miss Falconer was getting\nold and feeble in health, and if Charlotte was obedient and gentle, she\nwas well satisfied. So she worked covers in cross-stitch for the chairs,\nknitted her own stockings, read all the light literature which came in\nher way, and played on the cabinet piano which stood against the wall in\nthe sitting-room, with its crimson silk front gathered into the centre\nby a large rosette, and displaying, when open, a very narrow keyboard\nwith very yellow keys.\n[Illustration: The Vicar's Close, Wells.]\n\"How sweetly pretty you look to-day, Joyce. I can't help saying so.\nDon't be angry. I want to read you some verses I have written, called,\n'The Drooping Rosebud.'\" And Charlotte took out of her pocket the\ncrumpled page of a copy-book.\n\"You had better not read it now, Charlotte; Aunt Letitia will expect us\nto go downstairs.\"\n\"Only the first verse,\" Charlotte said, and then she began:\n\"'She bent her head in sorrow,\nThe pretty fragile rose;\nShe languished for the morrow,\nWhere light and gladness grows\nShe languished for a rain drop\nTo cheer her thirsty heart:\nShe was so sad and weary;\nIn joy she had no part.\n'As the raindrop to the rosebud,\nSo is his smile to me;\nAs----'\"\nHere Charlotte stopped and blushed. \"You know who I mean by the rosebud,\nand who the raindrop is?\"\nJoyce laughed merrily.\n\"Oh, Charlotte, you must not come to me for sympathy. I can't understand\nsuch sentiment. You have never spoken to Mr. Bamfylde in your life.\"\n\"_Not spoken_; no, but there is such a thing as the language of eyes.\nJoyce, you don't understand.\"\n\"No, I don't; and I think, Charlotte, it is nonsense to waste your\nthoughts on Mr. Bamfylde, who probably has never given you a thought in\nhis life.\"\n\"I am not so sure about _thoughts_, dear. However, I see you don't care\nabout it, or my verses, or me.\"\n\"Come, Charlotte, don't be silly! Of course I care about you, but I\ndon't think I am poetical or romantic. Indeed, we ought to go\ndownstairs.\"\n\"You must go first, and I will follow,\" said poor Charlotte, putting\n\"The Drooping Rosebud\" in her pocket again, with a sigh; and Joyce\ntripped downstairs alone.",

            "text": "The two girls set out, soon after dinner, for the market-place, where\nthe shops were situated. The market-place at Wells is not without its\npicturesque features; old gabled houses skirt the north side and part of\nthe south side, while a cross stands at the bottom of the square. Clear\nwater, from one of the many springs, which first attracted the College\nof Priests, in the time of Alfred's son Edward, to found their religious\nhouse in Wells, makes soft music as it runs down the streets in crystal\nstreams. Two quaint archways, or, as they were in old documents called,\nthe Palace Eye and the Deanery Eye, stand at the head of the\nmarket-square, and between them are two ancient houses, one of which was\nbuilt by Bishop Beckington, and has rooms over the porch, or gateway,\nthrough which foot-passengers pass into the Cathedral Green.\nThere is a delightful sense that life flows easily and peacefully at\nWells by the appearance of its citizens. The master of the large shop\nwhere the two girls stopped, was standing complacently at the door, his\nhands in his pockets, calmly surveying the rush of the cathedral\nchoristers across the square, for the first chime had sounded for\nafternoon service.\nJoyce was known as Squire Falconer's daughter at Fair Acres, and treated\nwith respect. She was conducted to a counter at the end of the dark, low\nshop, where the head shopwoman waited on her. Joyce's list of\ncommissions was for the most part of the homely and useful kind; but\nCharlotte was attracted by a display of gauze ribbons, then greatly\nin fashion, for the large loops worn on the crown of gipsy bonnets. She\nwas not proof against buying two yards of straw-coloured ribbon with a\nblue edge, and when the ring was pulled down the ends of her purse\nagain, it slipped off, for there was nothing left in it.\n[Illustration: The Market Place, Wells.]\n\"Look, Joyce, what lovely ribbon! Do get some, Joyce.\"\nBut Joyce was intently examining some homely towelling, and weighing the\nrespective merits of bird's-eye and huckaback.\n\"I don't want any ribbons,\" she said. \"Yes, it is pretty, but what are\nyou going to do with it?\" Then turning to the counter: \"I want a box of\nneedles--all sizes, and half-a-dozen reels of cotton, and----\"\n\"Joyce, I think I will go to the door while you are finishing all these\ndull things; and then----\"\nJoyce glanced at the large clock over the counter:\n\"Then, I think, we will go to the service, and if we are not too\nlate----\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" Charlotte said, eagerly. \"Do let us go, and come back to the\nchina-shop afterwards.\"\nCharlotte had her own reasons for desiring to go to the cathedral. The\nhero of her silent worship was Mr. Bamfylde, a new minor Canon, and it\nwas his week for doing the duty.\nJoyce completed her purchases, and left orders for them to be sent to\nthe Swan; and then, just as the last chime was ringing and the old clock\nstruck three, the two girls passed up the nave to the choir.",

            "text": "The work of restoration had not been begun, and the beautiful\nproportions of the choir of Wells Cathedral, were disfigured by high\nseats and an ugly pulpit. But Joyce's eyes were not critical, and she\ngave herself up to the soothing and elevating influence of the place,\nwithout any very distinct idea of why it was soothing and elevating. The\nservice was slovenly enough in those days, and the new minor Canon got\nthrough it as fast as he could. The choristers straggled in, with no\nregard to order, and the lay-vicars conversed freely with each other,\nnow and then giving the head of the chorister nearest to them a sharp\nrap with the corner of an anthem-book, or their own knuckles, through\nthe open desk. The boys' behaviour was a little better than that of the\nmen, for they had a wholesome fear of being reported to the Dean and\nChapter, and feeling the weight of the old Grammar School master's\nbirch-rod.\nWhen the service was half over there was a sound of feet and voice's in\none of the side aisles, and the Dean, who was in his stall, looked\nsharply round. The verger hobbled out to see what his coadjutor outside\nthe choir could be about, to allow such a disturbance. The verger was\nsound asleep, with his chin upon his capacious breast, and quite\nunconscious of the presence of the two young gentlemen who were chatting\nand laughing with each other, in the south transept.\nThe verger stumped after them, vainly endeavouring to rouse his heavy\nfriend, and said:\n\"There's service going on; you mustn't make a disturbance, gentlemen;\nit's contrary to the Dean's wishes.\"\nThe elder of the two men answered with a laugh, but the younger said:\n\"Be quiet, Falconer. Don't you hear they are reading prayers?\"\n\"Well, I am neither reading them nor saying them,\" was the answer. \"I\nhad enough of that at Pembroke. Now, old fellow, keep a civil tongue in\nyour head, will you?\" as the verger, angry at the contemptuous disregard\nof his commands, said:\n\"I'll turn you out, if you don't go peaceably.\"\nAgain another laugh; and the fat verger, who had now recovered from his\nheavy afternoon nap, came bearing down on the young men.\n\"You'll walk out this instant,\" he said, raising his staff of office.\n\"I wonder you ain't ashamed of yourself.\"\n\"No, my good man; on the contrary, I am proud of myself.\"\n\"Proud! Yes, a popinjay like you is proud enough, I'll warrant,\"\nmurmured the other verger.\n\"Can we get into the choir, Arundel?\"\n\"We had better wait here,\" was the answer. \"The service is nearly over.\nCome this way into the cloisters. Don't be aggressive, Falconer, and\nmake a row.\"\n\"I hate rows as much as you do,\" was the answer; \"but I am not inclined\nto knock under, to this pair of drivelling old idiots.\"\nI cannot say how this unseemly wrangle might have ended had not the\nverger in charge of the Dean heard the blowing of the organ pipes, which\nwas a warning that he was to hasten to perform his office, and conduct\nthe Dean back to the Deanery.\nAlmost immediately the organ sounded, and those who had taken part in\nthe service came out. Joyce and Charlotte were amongst the last of the\nvery scanty congregation.\nMelville, for reasons of his own, did not care to introduce his friend\nat that moment, and Mr. Arundel was quite unconscious that the fair face\nof which he caught sight, from under the shadow of the large bonnet,\nwas that of Melville's sister.\n\"What a sweet face!\" he thought; and then, as Joyce turned suddenly\ntowards the spot by the font where the two gentlemen were standing, a\nbright blush and smile, made her look irresistibly lovely.\n\"Who is that young lady, Melville? She knows you.\" For Joyce had made a\nstep forward, and then apparently changed her mind and went towards the\nnorth door with Charlotte.\nMelville fingered his cravat, and settled his chin in its place above\nit. \"That little girl dressed as if she came out of Noah's ark is my\nsister! Come, you will have another opportunity of cultivating her\nacquaintance, and you want to call at the Palace, don't you?\"\n\"My mother charged me to do so; but there is no haste.\"\n\"Oh, you had better not lose time, or you may not find your legs under\nthe Bishop's mahogany. We live some miles out, you know.\"\nMr. Arundel turned his head round twice to take a last look at the\nretreating figures, and then allowed Melville to tuck his arm in his,\nand walk down the cloisters with him to the Palace.",

Suddenly the bishop turned\nsharply on Melville, looking him down from head to foot with anything\nbut an approving glance.\n\"And what profession, sir, do you mean to take up?--law, like your\nfriend--or what?\"\n\"I am going to travel for a year, my lord.\"\n\"Travel! humph! Your good father has several sons, I think?\"\n\"Four younger sons, my lord; so much the worse for me.\"\n\"I hope you set them a good example,\" said the bishop, drily. \"I should\nventure to suggest that your father might want help with his estate.\"\n\"He has a steward, my lord, an old servant.\"\n\"Stewards mean money, don't they? and a gentleman with a small landed\nproperty cannot be overburdened with that article nowadays, more\nespecially if he has five sons.\"\nMelville's brow clouded, and he would fain, if he had dared, given vent\nto some rather uncomplimentary adjectives, of which \"old meddler\" was\none.\n\"Here,\" said the bishop, \"are the ruins of the old Hall, where, report\nsays, the last abbot of Glastonbury was hanged. He was tried here by the\nking's orders, for suppression of some of the church lands which the\nking had seized. That,\" pointing to the end of the Palace, \"is the part\nof the building which was blown down, or, rather, the roof blown in,\nupon one of my predecessors during the last century. Both Bishop Kidder\nand his wife were buried in their bed in the ruins. But not to dwell on\nthese memories, I have pleasanter ones to recount. On that terrace walk,\nwhere we will now mount and take a view of the surrounding country, the\npious Ken--that God-fearing and steadfast man--composed the hymns,\nwhich, morning and night, bring him to our minds.\"\nMelville Falconer had forgotten, if he had ever heard, those hymns; but\nMr. Arundel said:\n\"My mother will be interested, indeed, my lord, to hear I have been on\nthe spot where those hymns had birth.\"\n\"Ay,\" said the bishop; \"and we must have her here one day and show her\nthis fair place. One can imagine, as he gazed out on this prospect, that\nthe saintly Ken was eager to call on every one to 'shake off dull\nsloth,' and rise early with the birds to offer the sacrifice of the\nmorning.\"\nIt was indeed a fair prospect towards which the bishop waved his hand.\nFields of buttercups lay like burnished gold in the summer sunshine.\nBeyond these fields, known as the Bishop's Fields, was a belt of copse,\nand further still the grassy slopes of a hill, really of no very exalted\nheight, but from its strongly defined outline and the sudden elevation\nof its steep sides from the valley below it, it assumes almost\nmountainous proportions, and is a striking feature in the landscape as\nseen from Wells and its neighbourhood. A wooded height, known as Tor\nHill, rises nearer to the Palace, and then the line sweeps round to the\nMendip range, which shuts in Wells on the north-east, and across which a\nlong, straight road lies in the direction of Bristol.\nThe bishop continued to chat pleasantly as he led his visitors along the\nbroad terrace walk on the top of the battlemented wall. Then he passed\ndown into the garden, and ascended a spiral stone staircase which led to\na small ante-chamber, and then into the long gallery.",

See, they are\ncoming for it. Do you always bring them buns?\"\n\"Not always; but I had a convenient halfpenny left from the change at\nWillmott's, so I went to buy a stale bun at the little shop in Saddler\nStreet.\"\n\"Happy swans to be so remembered!\" Mr. Arundel said, as he watched the\nlast wedge of the stale bun gobbled up by the master of the brood, while\nhis wife gave him a savage peck with her black bill.\n\"It is a pity they are so greedy; it spoils their beauty,\" Joyce said.\nThen, with sudden recollection, she said, \"Oh! Charlotte, I have\nforgotten to take Piers' sparrow-hawk to Mr. Plume's. I must go at once\nto Aunt Letitia's and fetch it. I left it in the basket there.\"\n\"Can I go and fetch the sparrow-hawk, Miss Falconer?\" Mr. Arundel began.\n\"Come, Arundel,\" Melville interrupted, \"you and I can stroll round this\nmoat; we are not returning, as I told you, with Joyce.\"\nBut Mr. Arundel deliberately turned in the direction in which Joyce was\nhastening; and Charlotte, much to her cousin's vexation, was left with\nhim.",

Won't you come and pay\nauntie a visit?\"\nMelville had particularly desired to escape a visit to the Vicar's\nClose, but he began to fear it was inevitable.\n\"Do tell me about college,\" Charlotte began. \"I am dying to hear,\nbecause I have a special interest in college now.\" This was said with a\nsmile and glance which were meant to make an impression. \"And do you\nwear one of those sweet hoods with snow-white fur round it, Cousin\nMelville? They do look so pretty!\"\n\"Well--no,\" drawled Melville, evasively; \"I have not taken my B.A. yet.\"\n\"Mr. Bamfylde, the new minor Canon at the cathedral, wears one; and it\nis so charming!\"\n\"Humph!\" Melville rejoined.\nWhat were all the minor canons in the world to him that he should care\nwhether they wore fur-lined or silk-lined hoods at their backs?\nThey had reached the turnstile now leading into the Cathedral Green.\n\"I say,\" he began, \"I think I must bid you good-bye here, Charlotte. I\nwill call on Aunt Letitia another day, for I must look after the\ncarriage. I am afraid there should be some mistake. I want a pair of\ngreys to post with, and I should not wonder if they tried to pass off\ntwo old bays, with their bones just through their skins.\"\nAnd the next minute the fine gentleman was sauntering off in the\nopposite direction to poor Charlotte, who went away disconsolate.\nMeantime Mr. Arundel and Joyce had walked quickly to the Vicar's Close,\nand Joyce, having captured her basket with the dead bird, was surprised\nto find Mr. Arundel waiting for her at the little gate.\n\"Mr. Plume's shop is in New Street,\" she said. \"It is scarcely to be\ncalled a shop, but there are a few stuffed birds in the window. We must\ngo up the steps by the chapel into the North Liberty.\"\nMr. Arundel was struck with the business-like fashion in which Joyce\nconducted her interview with Mr. Plume.\nHe was a little dried-up-looking man, whose front parlour had that\npeculiar scent which is characteristic of rooms where stuffed animals\nare kept.\nMr. Plume did not confine himself to birds. A large fox, with gleaming\nteeth and glassy eyes, stared at the customers from a shelf in a recess\nby the fire-place. A badger was on another; and owls of all sizes and\ncolours were standing, with one foot tucked up, and a certain stony\nstare in their great round, unshadowed eyes.\nMr. Plume did not waste words.\n\"Sparry-'awk,\" he said \"sparry-'awk; it is of not great value, missie.\nHumph!\" he continued, \"it's not a rare speciment, but I'll set it up.\nHow's the young gentleman, eh?\"\n\"Quite well, thank you, Mr. Plume; and please have the bird ready by the\nnext time we come into Wells. We must not stop now; but what a noise\nthose men are making.\"\nAs she spoke, Mr. Arundel went out to the door, and Joyce, peeping\nthrough the cases in the window, saw a cart being dragged up the hill\ntowards the Bristol Road by four rough-looking men. Another huge man sat\nin the cart, his head lolling upon his breast, evidently the worse for\ndrink. A few wild-looking men and boys and a lean pony followed; and two\nor three women, with their hair hanging down their backs, brought up the\nrear; and all were shouting at the top of their voices some rhyme, the\ndrift of which was, that the justices had got the worst of it, and that\nBob was free.\n\"What does it all mean?\" Mr. Arundel said.\n\"Oh, it's only some of the rough Mendip folk. One of 'em was taken up\nfor snaring rabbits, and there was a great row. I suppose the justices\nhave let him off--afraid to do anything else. There is a deal of\nill-blood in them parts; and they say it's even worse in the cities than\nwhat it is in the country. Dear me!\" said Mr. Plume, stroking the back\nof a stuffed spaniel which was handy. \"It's a thousand pities folks\ncan't mind their own business, instead of annoying respectable folks.\nGood-day to you, Miss Falconer. Good-day to you, sir.\"\nWhen outside the shop Joyce paused and watched the straggling crowd wind\nup the steep hill.\n\"It is dreadful to see people like this,\" she said, with a sigh. \"I must\nask father about it; for he has been sitting on the bench to-day. I hope\nthey are not angry with him.\"\n\"I hope not,\" Mr. Arundel said; \"they look little better than savages,\nand would knock any one on the head for a trifle.\"\n\"We must make haste,\" Joyce said, \"for father does not like to be kept\nwaiting, and mother expects us home to tea. I dare say we shall get to\nFair Acres before you do.\"",

Thus it is to the first of these meals that I would bid you\nwelcome, as it is close upon eight o'clock now. Will you follow me to\nyour room?--which I hope you will find comfortable.\"\n\"I am sure I shall,\" said Mr. Arundel, warmly. \"It is very good of you,\nmadam, to invite me to Fair Acres.\"\nThese few words had passed in the hall; and the tap of Piers' crutches\nwas heard approaching, while Nip and Pip came bustling about the\nnew-comers, their short tails vibrating as if they were screwed on with\na wire!\n\"This is our youngest child, sir--Piers,\" Mrs. Falconer said.\n\"Where is Joyce, mother?\" Piers asked.\n\"Your sister is behind; our chaise passed her close to the gate.\"\n\"Why did not you come with her?\" Piers asked, bluntly.\n\"Because I was not allowed to do so,\" Mr. Arundel said, good-temperedly.\n\"I can tell you what you will be glad to hear, that your sister did not\nforget your sparrow-hawk.\"\nMelville, who had after all been wrangling with the postboy about his\ngratuity in a somewhat undignified manner, now came into the hall as his\nfather and Joyce appeared from a door under the wide staircase.\n\"Well,\" said the squire, \"you seem holding a counsel here; I hope it is\npeace, not war. Come, Melville, show your friend to his room.\"\nConsidering how greatly the squire had been annoyed by his son's driving\nout in the post-chaise, he spoke kindly and pleasantly; but Melville was\nalready assuming his grand airs.\n\"Here, Arundel,\" he said, \"I will take you to your room: first door on\nthe left, I suppose?\"\n\"You will allow me to do as I have done all my life, Melville,\" said his\nmother. \"I always go with my guests to their chambers, to see they are\ncomfortable. Now, Mr. A_run_del.\"\nTo Melville's horror, his mother put the accent on the second syllable.\nAnd as she tripped away--for her figure was still light and supple--he\nwhispered: \"He won't know who she means. Tell her, pray, not to say\nA_run_del.\"\nJoyce was indignant about the proceedings of the whole day, and she\nsaid:\n\"If you think it becoming to correct your mother, do it yourself.\" Then,\ngoing up to her father, she put her hand through his arm. \"Come and see\nthe last brood of chickens with me and Piers. They are lovely, dear\ndad.\"\nMelville turned away with a satirical smile on his lips, thinking it was\nimpossible to do anything with Joyce: she was content to let things\nremain as they were.\nMeantime his friend was conducted to the \"best room\" Mrs. Falconer had\nto offer--a spacious square room, with a large four-post bed, hung with\nwhite dimity, and so high that a pair of steps by which to climb into it\ndid not seem out of place.\nThe window was rather small for the size of the room, and the frames\nthick, but roses and honeysuckle hung their wreaths round it and\nperfumed the air.\nMrs. Falconer showed Mr. Arundel the high chest of drawers, and pointed\nto a hanging-closet, one of the top panels of which was glass, so that\nit might have a dim light from the room.\n\"I hope you will be comfortable,\" she said; \"the sheets are well aired,\nand so were the mattresses and beds, by the fire. I never trust to\nservants, but see to those things myself. We sup at nine o'clock; and if\nyou want anything please pull the bell.\"\n\"You are very kind,\" Mr. Arundel said. \"I hope my visit is not\ninconvenient.\"\n\"Oh, no; the boys are coming home from school to-morrow. Three boys make\nsome difference in a house; but I dare say you will be out a great deal\nwith my son Melville.\" A scarcely perceptible sigh accompanied the\nwords, and then Mrs. Falconer vanished; on the stairs she met Melville.",

I don't know that it matters what a man is called.\nAs to the supper, there's a round of beef, and a pie, and a baked\ncustard, and plenty of bread and cheese.\"\n\"I wish you could have some made dish to-morrow. Big joints are all very\nwell for a pack of hungry schoolboys.\"\nMrs. Falconer did not reply sharply, as she did sometimes. She turned\nand preceded Melville to his room, which was at the other end of the\nlong passage or corridor, which ran across the house, dividing it into\ntwo parts, front and back. Melville followed her, and assumed a careless\nand indifferent air, throwing himself on the deep window-seat and giving\na prolonged yawn.\nA pack of cards lay on the drawers, with a dicebox.\n\"We had high words last night, Melville,\" his mother began; \"and I was\nsorry----\"\n\"Don't scold or preach any more; I am sick of it. If you'll get my\nfather to let me travel, I'll come back in two years and settle into\nquite the country-gentleman; but you can't expect a fellow to bury\nhimself here at my age with a set of rustics.\"\n\"I have heard all this before,\" his mother said, in a sad voice, very\nunlike her usual sharp tones. \"What I want to ask is this: you have\nbrought your friend here without so much as consulting your father or\nme. I ask a plain question, is he a well-behaved man and fit to be the\nassociate of your sister and young brothers?\"\n\"Fit to associate with them! His mother is an Honourable, his\ngrandfather was a peer. Fit to associate with us, indeed, who are\nnothing but a pack of farmers!\"\n\"So you said last evening. I don't care a fig for lords and ladies; nor\nprinces either, for that matter: but this I say--if your friend teaches\nmy boys to gamble and drink, and is not to be trusted with your sister,\nbut may talk all kinds of rubbish to her, and you know it, you'll repent\nbringing him here to your latest day. I must just trust you, Melville,\nand if you say he is a well-behaved young man, well, I will believe you,\nand he is welcome to stay here.\"\n\"My good mother, you have got hold of the wrong end of the stick. The\nfact is Gilbert Arundel is a trifle _too_ good. He has a sort of mission\nto reform _me_. He has helped me out of scrapes and--well, I owe him\nsomething; and so, as he is of high family, I asked him to come here, as\nwe don't catch such folks often at Fair Acres. He said he would like a\nweek in the country, and he is looking after some place in Bristol,\nwhich is handy; so I asked him to come on here. Now are you satisfied?\"\n\"I know looks don't go for much,\" Mrs. Falconer said, \"but I do like\nhis looks very much; and his manners, too.\"\nMrs. Falconer hesitated, and seemed uncertain what she should say next.\nShe was not given to much demonstration of affection at any time, but\nher mother's heart yearned over this shallow-pated, self-indulgent son\nof hers. It seemed but yesterday that he was seated on her knee and\nthrowing his arms round her neck in his innocent childhood. But\nyesterday! and yet what a gulf lay between that time and this!\nShe could not have told why, or what innermost chord was touched, but\ncertain it is that she drew nearer Melville, and putting her hand on his\nforehead, and brushing back the stiff curls, which were persuaded by\npomade to lie in regular order on his head, she kissed him fondly.\n\"Oh! Melville,\" she said, \"my son, my son, you know how dearly I love\nyou. Do give up all your extravagant ways and high notions, and be a\ncomfort to your father and me, and set your young brothers a good\nexample.\"\nEven Melville was a little touched.\n\"Yes,\" he said, kissing his mother in return, \"yes, if you will let me\noff for a year, I will settle down and walk behind the plough, if you\nwish it then. Will that satisfy you?\"\nShe kissed him again, and saying, \"I will see what I can do with father\nabout your travelling,\" she resumed her accustomed brisk manner and left\nhim.",

            "text": "It was about five o'clock when the unusual sound of wheels was heard in\nthe road leading up to the house, and the squire, who was in the further\npart of the field, said:\n\"There's a carriage driving up! I think it is Mrs. More's.\"\n\"Mrs. More!\" exclaimed Mrs. Falconer, sharply. \"I hoped I had heard the\nlast of the dairy-maid.\"\nJoyce, who was at that moment seated on a haycock, with her rake thrown\ncarelessly at her side, sprang up. \"Did you say Mrs. More's carriage,\nfather? Oh, I am afraid--\" She stopped.\n\"Afraid of what?\" Gilbert Arundel asked.\n\"Oh, nothing; only Aunt Letitia said Mrs. More wanted to see me, or,\nrather, know me. Mother does not like Mrs. More, and Mrs. More thinks\nher very careless about the maids' education, just as Aunt Letitia\nthinks she is careless about mine; here comes Sarah.\"\n\"If you please, ma'am, I was to say Mrs. More wished you to come and\nspeak to her. She won't get out of the carriage, because her legs are\ntoo stiff.\"\n\"Come, my dear,\" the squire said, \"make haste, and go round to the front\ndoor.\"\n\"Not I. I shall not make haste; indeed, I'll send Joyce instead. Go,\nJoyce, at once. Say we are having a hay-making party, and end with a\nsupper when the last wain is carried; which, I'll be bound, she will\ncall sinful.\"\nJoyce had to free herself from the wisps of hay which clung to her, and\nto smooth her tangled curls. They were confined by combs and pins, but\nall had fallen out in the scrimmage in the hay, and they now fell on\neither side of her flushed face. Perhaps she had never looked more\nlovely than at that moment when, turning to her father, she said:\n\"Do you really wish me to go like this, dear dad?\"\n\"My dear, some one must go; and at once. Mrs. More is not a person to\nkeep waiting.\"\nJoyce did not delay a moment, but went with her quick, light step across\nthe field, and then through a little gate which opened into a belt of\nlow-growing shrubs, beyond which was the carriage-road from the village.\nAn old-fashioned _barouche_--old-fashioned even in those days--stood\nbefore the door, and sitting in it were two ladies; the elder one\nupright and alert, the younger leaning back as if to resign herself to\nthe long waiting time, before any of the family appeared.\nAlthough comparatively near neighbours in the county, Joyce never\nremembered to have seen Mrs. More before. Her name was familiar enough,\nand her schools, established on all sides, were known by every one,\nthough it cannot be said they were approved by every one.\nMrs. More and her sister had in times past made some overtures towards\nMrs. Falconer, but they were coldly repulsed, and a parcel of tracts had\neven been returned. Later there had been the disagreement about the\ndairy-maid, and the time for Mrs. Hannah More to carry the crusade into\nthe enemy's camp was over. She had, in the year 1824, nearly numbered\nher four-score years; and the loss of her sisters, and repeated attacks\nof illness, made her more willing to rest from her labours, only taking\ncare that the good seed sown in the days of health and vigour, should be\nwatered and cared for, that it might yield a good harvest.\nIt had happened that several times during the lovely spring of this year\nshe had met Joyce Falconer driving in the high gig with her father, or\ntrotting by his side on the rough pony, the use of which she shared with\nall her young brothers. The sweet, frank face had attracted her, and she\nhad inquired about Joyce when on a visit of ceremony at the Palace at\nWells a few weeks before.\nThe result was, as we know, that Miss Falconer gave a melancholy account\nof her niece's ignorance, which she believed was entirely due to her\nmother's prejudices as to boarding-schools and her father's\nover-indulgence and excessive affection for his only daughter.\nWith her accustomed sympathy with all the young who were just setting\nforth on life's journey, Mrs. More determined to see something of Mr.\nFalconer's little daughter, and her aunt's letter had decided her to\nlose no time in paying a visit to Fair Acres.\nAs Joyce came up to the steps of the carriage Mrs. More held out her\nhand--a white, delicately-formed hand, half covered by a lace mitten.\nJoyce had heard Mrs. More spoken of as an old lady of near eighty, and\nher surprise was written on her lovely face, as she said, simply:\n\"Are you Mrs. More?\"\nFor the beautiful dark eyes were still lustrous, and the lips, parted\nwith a smile, displayed a row of even teeth which many a young woman in\nthese days might envy. A quantity of white hair was turned back from a\nround, full forehead, which was shadowed by a drawn-silk riding-hood,\nwith a deep curtain and a wide bow under the chin. Intellect and\nbenevolence shone on the face, which was marked by few lines, and the\nstill young spirit lighted up the whole countenance as Mrs. More said:\n\"Yes, I am Mrs. More; and I have come to pay my respects to your good\nfather and mother, and to make your acquaintance.\"\n\"A great hay-making party is in the home meadow,\" Joyce said. \"My mother\nbids me present her apology; but my father will be here, I think,\nshortly. Will you not alight from the carriage?\"\n\"No, thank you kindly, my dear;\" and turning to Miss Frowde: \"my friend\nthinks me over-bold to drive so great a distance as this; but a desire\nto convey to you an invitation in person has brought me hither, in the\ndelightful cool of the summer afternoon.\"\n\"We must be getting home before the dew falls,\" Miss Frowde said,\naddressing Joyce for the first time; \"I have to take great care of\nprecious Mrs. More.\"\n\"Miss Frowde is kindly solicitous,\" the old lady said; \"I should be\nungrateful to disobey her orders so if I may ask for a drink of water\nfor the horses, and a cup of cider for the post-boy, we will not delay\nour departure beyond a few minutes.\"\n\"I am so sorry,\" Joyce began, \"that all the people are in the hay-field;\nbut I will send a message for a man who will attend to the horses, if\nyou will excuse me for a moment.\" She tripped away into the house, and\nvery soon the maid, who had been left in charge, was despatched to the\nhay-field, while Joyce returned to the carriage with a jug of milk and\ntwo glasses on a tray, with some sweet cakes of her own making, and\nsaid:\n\"May I ask you, madam, to take a glass of milk, as a little\nrefreshment?\"\nHannah More beamed down upon the sweet young face with her brightest\nsmile. She sipped the milk and told her companion to taste the lightest\nlittle cakes she ever ate; then she said:\n\"After all, I have not come to the real object of my call. I want your\nparents to spare you to me for a visit; and that you may not lack\ncompany, Miss Frowde will invite your cousin from the Close at Wells to\nmeet you.\"\n\"Thank you, madam,\" Joyce said; \"but I fear I cannot be spared during my\nlittle brothers' holidays. But here comes father.\"\nThe squire made the ladies in the carriage a low bow, and said the water\nwas ordered for the horses, and he much wished Mrs. More would alight\nfrom the carriage, and take some refreshment.\n\"The refreshment has been brought to me by the hands of your young\nHebe,\" Mrs. More said, smiling. \"As to alighting, my limbs are stiff\nwith age, and when once ensconced in my easy old chariot I am unwilling\nto leave it. But, Mr. Falconer, I came with a petition, for what is, I\nam sure, a precious possession: let me have your daughter at Barley Wood\nfor a month. I hope, God willing, to return your treasure, with interest\non the loan. Do not refuse me.\"\n\"Thank you kindly, madam,\" said the squire; \"but her mother must be\nconsulted. Her little brothers demand much of her attention in the\nholidays, and Joyce has to share her mother's labours in many ways. I\nfear she cannot be spared. What say you, my Sunshine?\"\n\"I could not be spared yet, father; but later--\" adding, with glistening\neyes--\"I should like to go to Barley Wood.\"\nThe squire put his arm round his daughter, and said:\n\"And I should like you to have the pleasure; but your mother----\"\n\"Well, well,\" Mrs. More said, \"then we will leave it, subject to certain\nconditions. The Bible meeting at Wrington comes on early in July. I\nshall have many excellent friends as my guests then, and the little\nSunshine--I like that name vastly--might dispense a little brightness\namongst us, and receive some solid good from intercourse with my friend.\nMay I hope to see you early in July?\"\n\"We will see about it, madam,\" the squire said; \"and both Sunshine and I\nfeel gratified by your kind proposal.\"\n\"Well, then, we leave it so, and I trust to you to drop me a line, my\nchild, when your visit can be made. We shall find a corner for you and\nyour cousin--if only a pigeonhole. You will not grumble, I dare say, but\nnestle in comfortably.\"\n\"The sun is getting low, dearest Mrs. More,\" Miss Frowde said; \"we\nshould be starting homewards.\"\n\"Yes, you are right.\" Then drawing from a large basket some books, Mrs.\nMore singled out one, and, bending down towards Joyce, said:\n\"This is the best of books; in it is to be found treasures of riches and\nknowledge. Accept the Bible from me, as a token of desire that now, in\nthe days of your youth, you may find the Pearl of great price. No one\ncan object to _this gift_, though objection to other books may be\nurged.\"\nJoyce took the Bible with a low-spoken \"Thank you!\" and her father\nglancing at it, said:\n\"You are very good to my little daughter, and I, at least, am grateful.\"\nThe squire had been secretly hoping that his wife would change her mind\nand appear, but his hopes were not realised. The carriage rolled off at\na leisurely even pace; the good-byes were said, but Mrs. Falconer did\nnot appear.\n\"It is a pity mother did not come,\" Joyce said. \"What a lovely old lady\nMrs. More is.\"\n\"Yes,\" and the squire sighed. \"You have got a Bible, Joyce.\"\n\"An old one, not like this,\" Joyce said, \"with gilt edges and such a\nnice purple binding; and I like to have it from Mrs. More. See, father,\nthere are pencil marks in it.\"\nThe squire looked over Joyce's shoulder at the page on which she had\nopened. It was the last chapter of Proverbs, and the words were",

            "text": "The fair weather lasted all through the week, and Sunday dawned in\ncloudless beauty. Fair Acres did not have the services of one clergyman,\nbut shared the ministrations of the vicar, with another small parish.\nThe cracked bell began to ring in a querulous, uncertain fashion on\nSunday morning, and punctually at half-past ten Mrs. Falconer marshalled\nher flock down the road to the church.\nThe church, though small, was architecturally a fine specimen of Early\nEnglish, and raised a noble tower to the sky; but the interior was\ndilapidated, and the pillars were covered with many coats of yellow\nwash, and the pews were hung with moth-eaten cloth. The squire's pew was\nlike a square room, with a fire-place and cushioned seats, and a high\ndesk for the books ran round it.\nMrs. Falconer and her husband sat facing each other on either side of\nthe door of the pew, and the boys were ranged round, while at the\nfurther end Joyce sat with Mr. Arundel, a place being left for Melville.\nJust as the clergyman had hurried on his very crumpled surplice, and the\nband in the gallery struck up the familiar air to which the morning hymn\nwas sung, Melville, dressed in his best, came up the uneven pavement of\nthe aisle with the proud consciousness of superiority to the rest of the\nworld. His father threw back the door, and he passed up to the further\nend of the seat, nodding carelessly to Mr. Arundel, who made no sign in\nreturn. Chatting and making engagements for the week was at this time\nvery common in church. There was scant reverence shown for the house of\nGod. He was a God afar off, and the formal recognition of some sort of\nallegiance to Him being respectable and necessary for the maintenance of\nsocial position, brought people like Mrs. Falconer to church Sunday\nafter Sunday.\nMrs. Falconer and the squire, with their family, were never absent from\ntheir places, and Mr. Watson, the squire's agent, acting as sidesman,\nwas also regular in his attendance.\nBut it was a lifeless mechanical service on the part of both minister\nand people; and the loud Amens of the old clerk were the only responses\nto be heard. The Psalms at the end of the book of Common Prayer were\nused, accompanied by a strangely-assorted band in the worm-eaten\ngallery, and two or three men and boys supplemented the scraping of the\nfiddle and bassoon with singing, which might well be called bawling.\nNor was Fair Acres an isolated instance of country parish churches; and\ncity churches, too, at this date. The great tide of the evangelical\nmovement had, it is true, set steadily in, and was soon to cover the\nkingdom with its healing and reviving waters; but its streams did not\npenetrate into the heart of the hills, and small outlying villages went\non, with no schools and no resident clergymen, and were contented\nbecause they were asleep.\nOf course the sound of \"the waters of Siloah\" were heard in\nSomersetshire as, one by one, Hannah More's schools grew and flourished,\nand, one by one, her enemies became her friends. But the apathy at Fair\nAcres on the part of the clergyman, and the determination of Mrs.\nFalconer to set her face like a flint against all innovations, was\nthought to be praiseworthy, and to show a laudable desire to resist\nmethodism in whatever form it took.\nGilbert Arundel's home-training had been very different from that of his\nfriend. His mother had early in life been brought in contact with\nseveral of the fathers of the evangelical school, and the spirit had\nquickened her faith into living heart service.\n\"How my mother would admire her!\" Gilbert thought, as he carried away\nwith him from the church the picture, in his mind, of the squire's young\ndaughter, as she followed the Psalms in the big prayer-book on the desk,\nand with her arm round Piers to steady him, pointed with her finger to\nthe words, reading the alternate verse with old Simkins, the clerk, in a\nvoice which Gilbert could barely catch, though he strained his ears to\ndo so.\nThere was an entire absence of self-consciousness in Joyce; and if the\nundulations of the small mirror over her high chest of drawers,\npermitted her to discern anything like the real reflection of her lovely\nface, she did not give it much thought.\nBrothers are not wont to admire their sisters or to tell them they are\nfair to look upon, and Joyce would have been very much surprised if she\nhad heard that her brother Melville said, she only wanted the\naccessories of fashionable dress to be accounted a belle at Bath or\nClifton, nay, even likely to make a sensation in the great world of\nLondon life.\nShe was a hopeless rustic now, but he saw in her capabilities which few\ngirls possessed.\nHe had said nothing about Joyce's beauty to Mr. Arundel, because he was,\nin his folly, ashamed to confess how devoid Joyce was of the ornaments\nwhich went so far to form his own estimate of a woman, and Mr. Arundel's\nsilence about Joyce, since that first day at the cathedral, seemed to\nhim to show that he only praised her at first, because she was his\nsister out of courtesy, and that he was, as every man of taste must be,\ndisappointed with her on nearer acquaintance. Superficial and foolish\nhimself, he was almost unable to appreciate the earnest sincerity of his\nfriend, and on this particular Sunday his temper had been tried by the\narrival of a letter from the Palace at Wells, brought over on the\nprevious evening by a special messenger, in which the Lord Bishop of\nBath and Wells requested the pleasure of Mr. Arundel's company at dinner\non the following Monday, but made no mention of him. He inwardly voted\nthe bishop \"a stupid old bat,\" as every one _must_ be who was blind to\nhis perfections!",

It used not to\nbe so; he was very different once.\"\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Arundel said, \"I can quite imagine it was so. Your brother is\nvery weak of purpose, and he got into a bad set at the university where\nI found him.\"\n\"What made you care for him?\" Joyce said, simply; \"you are so different\nfrom him.\"\n\"Well, the story is rather a long one, and I do not know that all of it\nis fit for your ears, or that I ought to inflict it upon you. Still I\nthink you should know something about it. I feel an interest in poor\nMelville much the same interest which a man takes in anything that has\ncost him some trouble.\"\n\"What made you take any trouble about him?\" Joyce asked.\n\"I scarcely know; pity, I think, began it; and who could help pitying\nhim? He got into the hands of an unprincipled man, much older than\nhimself, who is, in fact, a relative of mine, and I did what I could to\nget him out of his clutches. He got all his money out of him, and then\npersuaded him to gamble to get more; of course ending in losing it.\"\n\"How dreadful!\" Joyce exclaimed. \"Does father know?\"\n\"He knows about the money part, of course; about the debts and\ndifficulties.\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce exclaimed, with a sigh, \"and it has troubled him greatly.\"\n\"What I wanted to say to you was, that I think if Melville went abroad,\nas he wishes, it might be a good thing, provided a safe companion could\nbe found for him.\"\n\"Will you go?\" Joyce said, eagerly.\n\"No, it is impossible; I could not leave my mother: I am all she has in\nthe world. We are going to live in Bristol, where I am to be articled to\na good firm of lawyers, and perhaps I may study afterwards for the\nbar.\"\n\"I thought you were of high family,\" Joyce said innocently.\n\"Would that prevent my taking to law?\" Gilbert asked, with a smile.\n\"No; I don't know exactly why it should do so,\" she said. \"Melville\ntalks so much about things which are right for a gentleman to do, and",

Many men are fops in their youth who tone\ndown wonderfully when they get old. Let us hope it will be so with him.\"\n\"You know,\" Joyce said, \"that Melville ought to spare father expenses\ninstead of adding to them. There have been two bad harvests and hard\nwinters, and Mr. Watson, the steward, is getting rather past his work.\nMelville ought to take that place now, and save father, for there is\nRalph to be educated, and he ought to have the _best_, for he is so\nstudious; and then there are the three other boys, and poor Piers is\nlame, and they all want something.\"\n\"You don't seem to want anything yourself,\" Mr. Arundel said.\n\"No: I have a happy home and everything is beautiful about me. What\n_can_ I want?\"\n\"Not to go to London, or Bath, or to see the world?\" he asked.\n\"I think,\" said Joyce, simply, \"if it came in my way--I mean if there\nwas plenty of money--I should like to travel a little. Can you believe\nthat I have only been to Bath once and to Bristol twice in my life? and\nI am nearly eighteen. My Cousin Charlotte, who lives at Wells with my\naunt, has been to school in Bath, but father never wished me to go to\nschool, so I have no accomplishments. But I need not talk any more about\nmyself, it cannot be interesting.\"\nGilbert Arundel was beginning a speech to the effect that what she said\nwas most interesting to him, but somehow it died away on his lips. The\nsweet earnestness of the face which he had been watching while she\nspoke, the entire absence of self-consciousness, seemed to lift her\nabove the level of compliments or flattery, which the gentlemen of the\ntime considered the rightful inheritance of the young ladies, with whom\nthey trifled for an hour's amusement.\nAs she sat with her face towards the beautiful landscape over which the\nwestering sun was casting its level rays, she seemed so far above him\nand bearing the \"lily in her hand\" of which a poet of later days than\nthose in which Joyce lived has said that--\n\"Gates of brass cannot withstand\nOne touch of that enchanted wand.\"\nThe silence which fell over Gilbert was unbroken for a few minutes by\nany word on either side. At last Joyce said:\n\"Is there anything I can do for Melville? He has rather a way of looking\ndown on me, and I think I speak crossly to him sometimes. I wish you\nwould tell me if you think I could help father about him.\"\n\"If he does not listen to _you_ I should think it hopeless that he would\nlisten to anyone,\" Gilbert said; \"he has a way of looking down on most\npeople.\"\n\"Not on _you_?\" Joyce said, with a little innocent laugh. \"He made us\nthink you were very grand and that we must alter all our ways to suit\nyou; poor mother was to change the hours for meals, and----\"\n\"I never heard such nonsense,\" Gilbert said; \"but I know where he got\nthose notions from, and I may tell you this much, that the kindest thing\nyou can do is to ask your father, to consent to his going abroad for a\nyear as soon as may be; he will be out of harm's way. I have had some\nfears that the person who had such an evil influence over him might\nfollow him here, and I was determined to circumvent him.\"\n\"It was very kind of you to take this trouble. Who is the person?\"\n\"He is a step-uncle of mine; my mother's half-brother, Lord Maythorne.\"\n\"Quite a grand person, then?\" Joyce said.\n\"Grand in his own eyes; yes, undoubtedly; but there is every hope that,\nhaving got what he can out of Melville, he will leave him alone. You do\nnot know how ashamed I am to own him as a relation; and I am anxious to\ndo all I can to atone for the mischief he may have done your brother.\"\n\"Was he at Oxford with Melville?\"\n\"No: but, unhappily, he has a small place near Oxford, and was\ncontinually coming in.\"\n\"Shall I tell father all about what you have told me?\"\n\"I have told him already a good deal. What I want you to do is to use\nevery effort to persuade your father to let Melville start soon.\"\n\"It would be far better if I could persuade Melville to stay here, and\nlearn about farming.\"\n\"Yes; but that, I am afraid, you will never do; and considering that\nyour father wished him to work on the estate it was a mistake to send\nhim to Oxford at all.\"\n\"Oh, yes; but it was mother's wish, you know,\" Joyce said, with a\nheightened colour. \"Mother always feels that her family was not\nconsidered as good as father's; they were simple, homely, good people,\nbut not what are called gentry, and I think it has always been mother's\ndesire that Melville should have exactly the same advantages as the sons\nof our neighbours. Charlie Paget went to Oxford; they live at Ebbor\nCourt; and so it seemed her eldest son ought to go. It is so strange\nthat mother should be quite consistent on every subject but one, and\nthat one, the indulgence of Melville; and now I believe he will break\nher heart.\"\n\"No, no, I trust not so bad as that,\" Mr. Arundel said. \"I have hopes\nthat there will be a change for the better, and all this folly and aping\nhis betters will drop off like an old cloak one day.\"\nJoyce sighed.\n\"I wish I could have hopes too; there is always, I suppose, some cloud\nin everyone's sky; and we are so happy, that if it were not for\nMelville, we should have all we wished for. Yesterday in the hay-field I\nfelt as if even to be alive was delicious, everything was so bright and\njoyful. Then Mrs. Hannah More came and invited me to Barley Wood. Have\nyou heard of Mrs. More?\"\n\"Yes, I think I have. A very good old lady, who has set up schools for\nthe poor children. My mother knows all about her. Will you like going to\nBarley Hill?\"\n\"Barley Wood,\" Joyce corrected. \"Yes, I think I shall. Charlotte is to\ncome also; and I dare say I shall like it when I am there, and it may do\nme good. You know Aunt Letitia always calls me 'a little rustic.' Of\ncourse I _am_, but I do not know that it is of such great consequence as\nAunt Letitia thinks.\"\n\"It would be a pity, indeed, if you were anything but what you are,\"\nGilbert said earnestly. \"A change could hardly be an improvement.\"\n\"Oh, do not say that,\" Joyce said. \"I want to _know_ more, and though I\nread everything I can in father's library, I do not get any new books.\nRalph helps me with Latin, and Piers and I learn French together, though\nI expect our pronunciation would make you laugh. We have just read\nMadame de Stael's 'Corinne' and a story called 'Matilde,' which\nCharlotte lent me. Is not Piers wonderful?\" she asked; \"he is so happy,\nand have you seen his collection of moths and butterflies? You must come\ninto his room and see them.\"\n\"Yes, I should like to do so very much, if you will be showwoman.\"\nHe liked to hear her talk of her simple home pleasures and interests; he\nliked to watch the ever-changing expression of her lovely face; he felt\nwithin himself that this hour on the hill-side, was to remain a bright\nmemory with him for many a day, to which he would recur with pleasure,\nand over which no cloud could come.\nAt last the sound of the boys' voices in the copse below, roused them\nboth from their earnest talk, and Joyce's name rang through the still\nsummer air--\n\"Joyce! Joyce! tea has been ready ever so long. Mother does not like\nwaiting. Do come!\"\n\"Yes, pray come, Joyce; there is no one to pour out tea, or cut the\ncake. Mother says you ought not to have put sugar on the cake,\" said\nBunny. \"I am so glad you did.\"\nJoyce flew swiftly down through the wood, and by the time Mr. Arundel\nand her brothers had reached the house, she was at her post behind the\nlarge bronze urn, and taking up her accustomed duties with a face so\nbright and winning, that her mother forgot her vexation, merely saying:\n\"I like punctuality at meals, Joyce, especially on Sunday; for it puts\nthe servants out if they are driven.\"\n\"Why, my Sunshine,\" her father said, \"where have you been hiding? We\nthought you were lost.\"\n\"Joyce has been sitting under the fir-tree with Mr. Arundel,\" shouted\nBunny in his ringing, boyish treble. \"They have been there two hours.\"\nBunny was in advance of the other boys and their guest; and it was Piers\nwho said: \"You need not shout as if you were the town-crier!\" While\nMelville dragged himself out of the depths of a large sofa covered with\nhorse-hair, where he had been sleeping off the effects of his large\ndinner and repeated glasses of ale and wine, and said the boys' voices\nwere a perfect nuisance, and he did not know what Arundel thought of\nsuch a hubbub.\nA laugh from the person in question, as he passed the open window with\nRalph, seemed to point to the fact that Gilbert had as light a heart as\nany of the young brothers at whom Melville so often took offence.\nFamily prayers were the exception in many households in these days; but\nas there was only one service in the church on Sundays, the squire,\nfollowing his father's custom before him, always assembled the household\nin the evening, and read a chapter from the old family Bible, and a\nshort dry sermon with a prayer from an old book, in which was written\nhis mother's name. It might be questioned whether the rosy-cheeked\nmaiden and the stalwart young men from the Farm, who sat with their\nhands one on each knee, staring at Melville and the visitor, as strange\nspecimens of humanity, could understand a word of the sermon or follow\nthe prayer.\nPerhaps Joyce scarcely realised how dry and formal this service was, and\nyet this evening a new spirit seemed to be stirring within her, an\naspiration for something, she hardly knew what, but something which was\nnot outside of her, but touched her inmost heart.\nHer mood was subdued and quiet during the rest of the evening, and when\nshe knocked at Piers' door to be admitted, as was her invariable custom,\nto make his room tidy, and place his crutches near the bed, the boy",

She knew what they were talking about,\nand she said:\n\"Of course I like Mr. Arundel, who is so good about Melville, and came\nhere solely to try to be of use to him: very few people would have taken\nthat trouble.\"\nPiers gave a low rejoinder, which might be taken for consent.\n\"He says, Piers, a man he knows has a bad influence over Melville, and\nthat he is a relation of his, and that he thinks Melville ought to be\nsent abroad.\"\n\"To do just what he likes, as he always does,\" was Piers' rejoinder. \"It\nis a shame that Melville should bring so much trouble on us.\"\n\"Yes, it does seem a shame,\" Joyce said; and then she went to the bed,\nand, kneeling down, kissed Piers' hand as it lay upon the counterpane.\n\"I felt so sorry for you this afternoon, dear,\" she said. \"It gave me a\ngreat pain to hear Melville speak as he did to you.\"\n\"Never mind, Joy, never mind. What does it matter?\" And the boy stroked\nhis sister's hair fondly. \"I don't mind; I would rather have my crooked,\nhelpless legs than be like _him_. Yes, I really would,\" he repeated.\n\"But Joyce, don't begin to care for any one more than me; that is what I\ndread.\"\n\"You foolish boy,\" she answered; \"as if I could care for any one as I do\nfor you! And when I come back from Mrs. More's I shall have so much to\ntell you; and I may get some nice books there, which we will read\ntogether.\"\nPiers turned suddenly and threw his arms round his sister's neck. He was\nnot usually demonstrative, but he said, with passionate energy, \"While I\nhave you, Joy, I can bear anything. Good-night.\"\n\"Good-night, dear; and never take foolish fancies into your head. You\nmay be sure I shall always love you and be all I can to you.\nGood-night.\"\nThere is no doubt that a protecting maternal element in the love of a\nsister for a brother makes the tie one of the most beautiful that\nexists. From the time of Piers' accident Joyce had constituted herself\nhis helper and friend. Mrs. Falconer in her busy life could not devote\nherself to her crippled boy, as mothers of a less energetic and active\nnature might have done.\nJoyce and she had it is true one aim in common: to hide from the father\nthe sad consequences of that one rash act which had shut Piers out for\never from the free, joyous life of his young vigorous brothers. Mrs.\nFalconer did this by apparently making light of her boy's ailments, and\ninability to do what others did.\nIt was a good thing, she would say, that he could not climb trees and\ntear his clothes, or get into the stream by Wookey and ruin his boots\nand socks, or make her anxious by carrying a gun behind his father, in\nthe time of rabbit and rook shooting.\nMrs. Falconer never betrayed what was indeed the truth, that the sound\nof Piers' crutches as they tapped across the old stone pavement of the\nhall, sent a thrill of sorrow through her breast, and that when Piers\nwas laid up, as was not unfrequently the case, with an attack of pain in\nthe hip which had been so severely injured, she avoided being much with\nhim, and left him to Joyce, because the sight of his suffering brought\nback the memory of that morning when she saw him clinging with a\nfrightened face to Rioter's back, and heard her husband say, \"Don't make\na coward of the boy: his brothers rode long before his age.\"\nShe knew too well how bitter had been her husband's self-reproaches,\nand she dreaded adding to them by any impulsive, unguarded word of her\nown.\nThus it was that Joyce was sister, mother, and friend to her lame\nbrother. Their lives were bound up together, and the bond strengthened\nas time went on.\nIt was sufficient reward for Joyce to know that, however irritable when\nin pain, or depressed sometimes by a sudden reminder of his helplessness\nwhen contrasted with his brother's independence and vigour, she could\nalways be sufficient to charm away the cloud by her own sunny\nbrightness, and that by making his interests hers, she never let him\nthink she did anything for him, which was not a real pleasure to\nherself.\nThe secret of heart service lies in this, that those who are served\nnever know it to its full extent, and that any effort that may be made,\nor any trouble that may be taken, is so hidden under the mantle of\nall-pervading love that it is often wholly unsuspected. When the giver\nis as happy as the receiver, the gift, in whatever form, is sweetened\nand enhanced a hundred fold.",

He dreaded to\nchange the present happy relations between him and Joyce by telling her\nwhat he felt. She confided so entirely in him; she told him so much of\nher little joys, and home happiness, of Ralph's cleverness, of Harry and\nBunny's frantic desires to be sailors, of her father's goodness to\nMelville, and infinite patience with him. On this last night especially,\nhe felt that he could not bring himself to break the spell, and disturb\nthe serenity of that sweet, pure life, by letting friendship go, to\nreplace it by the more tumultuous and passionate love, which he knew if\nonce this barrier were broken down, he should pour forth on her in a\ntorrent which might distress and almost frighten, one so simple and so\nunversed in the world's ways.\nWhilst Charlotte was always on the look-out for some _preux chevalier_,\nwho was to be at her feet and vow eternal devotion, Joyce had as yet no\nsuch airy castles. Her education had been widely different from her\ncousin's, and home and home interests had so filled her seventeen years\nwith their joys and pleasures, that she had no time to dream over\n\"keepsakes,\" and read Miss Burney's romances, or steep herself in the\nunreality of sentimental verses, which Wordsworth was beginning to break\ndown and send into the shadows, by bringing out the beauties of\ncreation into the strong light, which his genius threw around them.\nJoyce had not wasted her youth in foolish dreams of impossible\nperfection, but when the real story of her life was ready to unfold\nitself, she would find a zest and fulness in it, that the sentimental\nvisionary could never know.",

My father only did his duty on the bench that\nday. You were guilty, and you know it; you got off unpunished, and you\nshould be thankful, and try to lead a better life.\"\nThere was something wonderfully grand in the way Joyce spoke, though her\nface was white with girlish fear, and her lips quivered, her voice did\nnot falter as she appealed to the huge man who might, she knew, shake\noff Gilbert's restraining hand, and spring on her at any moment.\n\"Let me pass,\" she said, \"and this gentleman will----\"\nAt this moment a woman's voice was heard, and a girl with a red\nhandkerchief on her head, with an effort at respectable attire in her\nshort, blue cotton frock, and large, thick boots, came over the tangled\nmass of heath and ling, and cried:\n\"Father! What are you about now, father?\"\n\"You mind your own business, you hussy, and leave me alone.\"\n\"Oh, father!\" the girl said, passionately, \"I wish you would be good.\nThink how mother used to pray for you! Oh, dear lady,\" the girl said,\nbursting into tears, \"I am heart-broken about father. Please, sir, let\nhim go.\"\n\"Let me go!\" said the giant, with a loud, discordant laugh; \"I'll see\nabout that.\" Then, with a mighty effort, he hurled Gilbert from him, and\nbefore he could recover his feet, he had seized Joyce's arm. \"Give me\nthe money, or I'll be even with your father; curse him!\"\nBut the girl threw herself on her father and held him back, while\nGilbert, stunned and bewildered by the force with which he had been\nhurled over the heather, staggered to his feet again, and, with a\nwell-aimed blow at the back of the man's head, laid him sprawling on\nthe path.\n\"Oh! I hope he is not hurt!\" Joyce exclaimed involuntarily, as the huge\nform lay motionless; the girl leaning over him.\n\"He is not hurt,\" Gilbert said, \"any more than he has hurt me; it was in\nself-defence,\" he added.\n\"Father, father!\" moaned the girl. \"Oh, sir! oh, miss! I don't know what\nto do!\"\n\"Hold your tongue, and let me get up and at him again,\" growled the man,\nstruggling to sit upright.\nBut his daughter had the advantage, and seated herself on her father's\nchest, saying to Gilbert, \"I'll keep him quiet till you are out of\nsight, sir; I will indeed. I know you were driven to do it,\" she said.\n\"Father is always fighting; but, oh! sir, we have a hard time of it.\nThere is no work for the men and boys, and if it were not for the good\nlady's schools, and the help she gives, I don't know what would become\nof us. Many were starving last winter, and of course it is kind of hard,\nto know rich folks have plenty and we are starving. Mother died last\nfall; and though Mrs. More sent her physic, and the schoolmistress\nbroth, she could not stand up against the fever, and trouble about poor\nfather and Jim, and Dick, and the baby.\"\nJoyce's eyes filled with tears. \"What is to be done?\" she said,\nhelplessly; \"what can be done?\"\n\"I don't know, miss; I don't know. There's plenty of the ore left, but\nit is no use working it, there's no market for it. Mrs. More teaches us\nto pray to God and try to trust Him, but He does not seem to hear or\nhelp. I have been in service, and could get a place again at a Farm at\nPublow, through Mrs. More, but since mother is gone, there is none to\nlook after baby. I do love the baby!\"\n\"How long are you going to jaw like this, Sue? Let me get up and settle\nthe question; if not now, I _will_ settle it at last.\"\n\"Come away,\" Gilbert said, putting his hand on Joyce's arm; \"we can do\nno good. It is getting so dark. Do come!\" He put his hand to his head,\nfor he still felt dazed and giddy with his fall.\n\"Tell me your name,\" Joyce said, \"and where I should find you.\"\n\"Susan Priday, Mendip Mines, that's my name, miss.\"",

            "text": "\"I am going to see Mrs. More soon, and I will tell her about you,\" Joyce\nsaid, in a low tone; \"and do believe I am sorry for you. How old are\nyou?\"\n\"Eighteen come Christmas,\" the girl said, looking up into Joyce's\nbeautiful face with undisguised admiration.\n\"Just my age,\" Joyce said. \"Oh, I should like to make you happy! How old\nis the baby?\"\n\"Born when mother died--just nine months old; he is so pretty, he is!\"\nJoyce had seldom, if ever, spoken familiarly to any of the girls about\nthe country side before. Mrs. Falconer had her views on the subject, and\nthe \"miner folks\" were her especial aversion, while Mrs. More's attempts\nto civilise them were met with derision and scorn. The gulf set between\nher and her household of respectable maids, and the rough, half-clothed\nminer's families, was in her eyes impassable! What was the use of\ntrying to reclaim those who preferred their own rough and evil ways?\nThey ought to be well punished for raids made on farm yards, and snares\nset in copses and plantations; but to teach them to read, and talk to\nthem about their duty to God and their neighbour, was in Mrs. Falconer's\neyes worse than lost labour; it did harm rather than good.\nAnd not only by Mrs. Falconer was this view of the unclothed and\nunwashed masses taken! In our days of widely spread and organised\ncharities, and zeal, sometimes I fear hardly tempered with wisdom, it is\ndifficult to throw ourselves back to the beginning of the century now\ndrawing to its close, when efforts like those of the four sisters of the\nMendips, of whom Hannah was the leading spirit, were met with scoffs and\ndisapproval; or deep compassion, that educated women could be so\nmisguided, as to wish to teach the boys and girls of their district,\nanything but to use their legs and arms in the service of their betters!\nAs I stood by the heavy stone in Wrington churchyard, in the gloom of\nan autumn afternoon, where the names of the four sisters are inscribed,\nI could but think of the gratitude we ought to feel to them for their\nbrave efforts to spread the knowledge of the religion of Christ amongst\nthe poor of those 'rolling hills' and peaceful valleys of\nSomersetshire. It must have been hard for a woman of culture like Hannah\nMore to be met by opposition, and in some cases fierce denunciation;\nharder still to be smiled at by those in high places, as a fanatic and a\nvisionary. But turning from the ugly, weather-worn stone, enclosed in\nhigh rusty railings, to the beautiful church, where what light there was\nyet in the sky, came through the many-coloured window lately erected to\nHannah More's memory, I thought, that as nothing that is good and\nbeautiful, coming from the Fountain of all beauty and all goodness, can\never die, so the light which Hannah More kindled in many humble hearts\nwas still shining in the eternal kingdom, where those that have lived as\nin the presence of the Son of God here, shine as the stars for ever in\ntheir Heavenly Father's realm.\nThat touch of Nature which makes the whole world kin brought the two\ngirls near to each other, as Joyce laid her hand upon Susan's, and said:\n\"I am very sorry for you; I shall not forget you;\" then added, looking\ndown on the prostrate form which Susan had so determinedly kept from\ndoing further mischief:\n\"I am sorry for you, too; it must be hard to want bread--but, but--do\ntry to be good and find work.\"\n\"Find work, find work! If that's all you can say you'd better hold your\ntongue.\"\nBut though the words were rough the tones grew less fierce, and Susan,\nfinding her restraint was no longer needed, stood up and watched Gilbert\nArundel and Joyce pursue the narrow track across the heather till they\nwere lost in the shadows of the gathering twilight.\n\"Do you know your way?\" Gilbert asked.\n\"I think I do,\" Joyce answered; \"our shepherd's cottage is on the next\nridge, and when we get there we can see our own valley and the tower of\nthe church.\"\n\"Are you very tired?\" Gilbert asked again.\n\"Not very; but I cannot help trembling; it is so silly. Do tell me if\nthat man hurt you.\"\n\"He gave me a good shaking. What a giant he is! I felt as your Nip or\nPip might feel in Duke's clutches if he were angry.\"\n\"What a comfort we had not Charlotte with us, and that the boys had gone\non so far! I hope they will not be very anxious at home.\"\nThey made but slow progress. Joyce's usually swift, elastic steps were\nslow and faltering. She took several wrong paths, and they came once to\na steep dip in the heather, and were within a few inches of one of\nthose rocky pits which are frequent on the face of the level country\nabout Cheddar and the neighbouring district. Indeed Cheddar itself\nbegins with one of these small defiles, when entered from the top of the\nMendip, and the gradually increasing height of the rocks, and the\nwidening of the gorge as the road winds through it, is one of its most\nstriking features.\nJoyce was so wholly unaccustomed to feel tired and unnerved, that she\nsurprised herself, as well as Gilbert, by sitting down helplessly, and\nbursting into tears.\n\"Oh! we should have been killed if we had fallen down there. Won't you\nleave me, and go on to the shepherd's cottage? What can be the matter\nwith me?\" she said, sobbing hysterically.\nGilbert hardly knew whether distress at her condition, or delight in\nhaving her all to himself to comfort, predominated.\n\"Do not be frightened,' he said; we shall get on very well if you will\nlet me carry you.\"\n\"Oh! no, no,\" she said, trying to spring up with her accustomed energy.\n\"I will push on again.\"\nBut although she summoned all her courage, she was obliged to let\nGilbert put his arm round her and support her, and finally she was\nlifted in his strong arms and carried whether she wished it or not.\n\"I shall tire you so dreadfully,\" Joyce whispered.\n\"If you do, it is the sweetest tiredness I ever knew; you know that,\nJoyce.\"\nThen they went on in silence. Gilbert was still suffering from the\ntreatment he had received at Bob Priday's hands, and they made slow\nprogress.\n\"Just raise your head,\" he said, after ten minutes' tramp through the\nnarrow track, which he lost at times through the thick tangle of heath\nand gorse and low-growing bracken. \"Raise your head and tell me if you\ncan see the shepherd's cottage. It is getting very dark.\"\nJoyce did as he told her, but, after straining her eyes for a few\nmoments, she said:\n\"I can't see anything, it is so dark. I don't know where we are. Oh, I\ndon't know!\"\n\"You are safe with me,\" Gilbert said; and then added, fervently: \"I am\nnot afraid for God is with us.\"\nIt was so unusual for Joyce to hear that Name spoken. She did not\nrespond, but let her head fall upon his shoulder again.\nPresently he said:\n\"There is a tiny light now--two lights--they must be in the shepherd's\ncottage. Take heart, my darling. We shall soon be home.\"\nThe word had slipped from his lips unawares.\n\"I am going away early to-morrow. You will not forget me?\"\nOnce more she raised her face, and in the dim light he saw her beautiful\neyes gazing at him with an expression which was half wonder and half\njoy. But she said, simply:\n\"No, I will never forget you.\"",

We have been very\nanxious, your mother on thorns, and poor Piers imagining all kinds of\ndisasters. Why did you not keep up with the boys? They had been at home\nan hour before I started. What has happened sir?\" the squire said,\nturning a little sharply on Gilbert Arundel.\n\"It is too long a story to tell now, sir,\" Gilbert said. \"Miss Falconer\nand I fell into bad hands, and we may thank God nothing worse has\nhappened.\"\n\"Some of the miners, eh?\"\n\"One of them, sir, who is a host in himself; he blocked our way, and\nthreatened us; but I would rather not go over it all now. She is so\noverwrought, though she has been so splendidly brave.\"\n\"Oh! father, dearest dad! take me home,\" Joyce said. \"Is it far; is it\nfar?\"\n\"Some two miles, my Sunshine; but I can carry you. Now for it, be brave,\nmy sweet one, and we shall soon be home. Now, then, Sam and Thomas,\nmarch on.\"\n\"I think I can walk, father now,\" Joyce said; \"and here is Duke, dear\nDuke!\"\n\"Why, of course, I brought Duke. He is cleverer at finding his way than\nI am. He soon snuffed you out, good old fellow.\"\nThe two other men now turned towards home, with the big lanthorns in\ntheir hands, which served for guiding stars. Duke paced slowly between\nthe men, and his master and young mistress, and Gilbert brought up the\nrear.\nThe lights of the village were a welcome sight, and the hall door of\nFair Acres was open as they came up the road, showing a group of dark,\nexpectant figures, thrown out by the blaze of a wood fire.\n\"The mistress has lit a fire that we might have a welcome; that is like\nher wisdom,\" the squire said. \"A few tallow candles would not have been\nhalf as cheerful.\"\n\"Here we are; here we are!\" the squire called out; and then there was a\nrush of boyish feet, and a great chorus of rejoicing, and a host of\nquestions.\n\"We have been so anxious, _dying_ of anxiety,\" exclaimed Charlotte,\nthinking it necessary to begin to cry.\n\"What fools you were to walk over that rough, lonely country,\" Melville\nsaid. While Piers could only hover round Joyce, who, seated on a bench\nor old-fashioned settle by the side of the wide open hearth, held her\nmother in a tight embrace.\n\"The boys ought never to have left you,\" Piers said. \"How could Mr.\nArundel find the way?\"\n\"Joyce knew it,\" said Bunny. \"Joyce knew it. We have been over that\ntrack several times.\"\n\"Yes,\" echoed Harry, \"several times; only Joyce and Mr. Arundel were\ntalking so much, they never thought where they were going.\"\n\"'All's well that ends well,'\" said the squire. \"She had better go to\nbed, my dear; and this young gentleman looks white enough. You must get\nhim a good hot glass of negus; and I hope supper is ready; but take the\npoor child to bed first.\"\nMrs. Falconer had not said much beyond a few words in Joyce's ear, which\nno one else heard. Her usual vivacity and quick, sharp words seemed to\nhave suddenly failed her.\n\"Yes; I'll take her to bed, and there she will have to lie all\nto-morrow, I expect. It's the last time I'll allow her to separate from\nthe rest of us, when we are out on an excursion. Order the supper in,\nboys; and Melville, look after your friend; he is as white as a ghost;\nperhaps he has seen one!\"",

He did not seem inclined to say\nanything in reply to his wife's last question.\n\"Because,\" said Mrs. Falconer, with that far-seeing and oracular wisdom\nin which men hope in vain to rival us in these matters, at least;\n\"because I believe Gilbert Arundel is in love with our Joyce.\"\n\"Well,\" said the squire, \"that would be no wonder to me; but I daresay\nit is only one of your fancies, Kate.\"\n\"We shall see; we shall see,\" said Mrs. Falconer. \"I only hope he has\nnot trifled with my child, and that my 'fancies,' as you call them,\n_are_ fancies, that is all.\"",

            "text": "ON SION HILL, CLIFTON.\nGilbert Arundel was to meet his mother in Clifton, where arrangements\nwere to be made for their permanent residence there. Clifton was at this\ntime gradually changing its position, or rather enlarging its borders!\nAt the close of the preceding century, or during the latter half of it,\nClifton Spa was the chief attraction. To these healing waters, as we\nknow by Mason's celebrated epitaph, a sorrowing husband brought his\nfading wife. Dowry Square and Dowry Parade, with their little quaint\npillars and balconies were in great request for invalids and visitors,\nfrom their near neighbourhood to the pump room.\nConsumptive patients might be seen slowly walking under the row of trees\nby the banks of the muddy Avon, and gazing across at the deep recesses\nof the Leigh Woods with wistful eyes. To the weak and the ailing\nNightingale Valley was then, though so near, very far off for them, and\nonly the robust and vigorous could cross the river by Rownham Ferry,\nand scale the wooded heights which at all times and in all seasons are\nso fair to look upon.\nBut at the time of which I write the tide of visitors was setting in\n_upwards_. The word \"relaxing\" was coming into fashion, and enterprising\nbuilders had raised, halfway up the hill, Windsor Terrace and the\nParagon, that circular range of houses which, entered from the level\nroad before Prince's Buildings, ends abruptly in a house which may\nindeed be said to \"be built upon a rock,\" the windows looking straight\ndown its precipitous sides.\nAlong the road which I have mentioned, which follows the course of the\nriver, though high above it, was erected 'Prince's Buildings;' the\n'first gentleman in Europe' during his long regency appears to have\nsupplied the names of many streets and terraces in this neighbourhood.\nCoronation Road beneath commemorates the auspicious event when Queen\nCaroline was shut out from her rights, and Prince's Buildings above was\nalso previously named in his honour. Crescents and terraces were quick\nto follow one another on the heights, and the glories of the Hot wells,\nand the salubrity of the waters, became things of the past.\nBracing air began to be the panacea for ailments, and the Clifton Downs,\nnow secured to the citizens of Bristol by the merchant venturers for\never, were sought by many who, a few years before, would have buried\nthemselves and their hopes of recovery under the shadow of the rocky\nheights, instead of facing the keen air upon their summit.\nThere was a medium preserved, however--Prince's Buildings, and the\nhouses built on the slope of Sion Hill, were sheltered at the back and\nfrom the front commanded a view of the Leigh Woods before them, and a\nshoulder of the great St. Vincent Rock to their right, which might well\nexcite the admiration of those who saw it for the first time.\nAfter Gilbert Arundel had stepped less briskly than sometimes up the\nsteep slope of Granby Hill, leaving the Crescent to his right, he passed\nalong the back of Prince's Buildings and up Sion Hill, where his mother\nhad taken up her temporary abode.",

            "text": "These houses are built with old-fashioned bow windows, some of them\nrunning up from the basement to the roof, and one or two with circular\nbalconies on the second story.\nAs Gilbert was beginning to consider which number his mother had given\nas her address, he heard his name called from above, and looking up, a\ntall, fashionably dressed young lady said:\n\"Gilbert, we thought you were never coming from Fair Acres. There\nmust have been some great attraction.\"\n[Illustration: St Vincent's Rock, From Leigh Woods.]\nGilbert did not care to have his personal history proclaimed to the\npeople who were seated on benches at the top of the Zig-zag--a path now\ncut in the rock and made easier of ascent by means of flights of steps,\nbut then scarcely more than a bridle path, rough and slippery to the\nfeet.\nThe door was open and Gilbert walked in, and walked upstairs. His mother\nwas on the watch, and came to the head of the stairs to meet him,\nkissing him affectionately.\n\"Well, my dear son, are you pleased with our quarters? But, Gilbert, you\ndo not look well; what is the matter?\"\n\"Nothing; I had a tussle with a Somersetshire miner last evening, and\nfeel as if I had got the worst of it to-day. What a lovely view you have\nfrom the window!\"\nThe young lady who had spoken to him on the balcony now stepped into the\nroom.\n\"Well, Gilbert, Aunt Annabella and I had quite given you up. My dear\ncousin, you look very lugubrious.\"\n\"Do I?\" Gilbert replied. \"A head-ache is a lugubrious thing; and how are\nyou, Gratian?\"\n\"Pretty well. I have been rather out of sorts; but I shall soon recover,\nnow you are come.\"\n\"That is a very pretty speech, Gratian, only I can't quite believe it.\"\n\"Well, I am going to take a walk abroad now, and leave you and your\nmother to have a chat together, all about Fairy Acre, or Fair Acre;\nwhich is it? I am very stupid; pray forgive me. Any commissions in the\nMall or Regent Street, Aunt Bella?\"\nMrs. Arundel, who had been getting her son some refreshment from one of\nthe deep cupboards by the fire place, and was anxious to administer a\nglass of wine, now turned towards her niece. \"No. Are you going alone,\nGratian?\"\n\"Yes, I am starting alone; I don't mean to fall over the rocks.\nGood-bye.\"\nGratian Anson was long past her _premi\u00e8re jeunesse_, and had never been\nactually pretty; but she was one of those women who exercise an\nextraordinary fascination apparently without any effort, and have their\nprey in their net, before there is any suspicion that the net is spread.\nGratian dressed fashionably, and one of her perfections was a tall and\nwell-proportioned figure. We might not, now-a-days, think it was set off\nby her short and full-flounced muslin gown, made with a short waist,\nthe body cut low, while over it she wore an enormous pelerine of muslin,\nedged with lace, which was crossed ever her breast and fastened with a\ncurious antique brooch.\nEven Gratian's tall figure could scarcely bear gracefully the width\nwhich fashion had decreed; and all was surmounted by a hat with a\nsugar-loaf crown, and a deep brim caught up on the left side by a large\nred rosette.\nAs she drew on her long, loose gloves, she surveyed her cousin with an\nappraising, searching glance. Her eyes were at all times too keen, and\nher wide mouth displayed a row of white teeth more fully than was quite\nagreeable.\n\"Ah!\" she said, tapping Gilbert's shoulder; \"ah! he is in love. I have\nno doubt of it! _Adieu; au revoir, cher cousin!_\"\n\"The same as ever!\" Gilbert said. \"Thank you, dear mother,\" he said,\nrising with his accustomed courtesy to take the glass of wine from her\nhand. \"Thanks. I confess I am rather knocked up; and if I had known Sion\nHill was so far from the Bristol coach office I should have come up in a\nhackney, I think, instead of sending my luggage by the carrier. But how\nbeautiful this is!\" he said, stepping on the balcony and looking out\nupon the scene before him.\nNo piers had yet been raised for the great design of the Suspension\nBridge--that vast dream of Brunel's, which for so many years seemed\nfated to remain only a dream; while the naked buttresses, in all their\nhuge proportions, stood like giants on either side of the gorge,\nconnected only by a rod of iron, over which a few people with strong\nnerves were allowed to pass in a sliding basket.\nGilbert looked out on a scene which can hardly be equalled for the\nunusual beauty of its salient points.\n\"We shall be happy to live here, mother,\" Gilbert said.\n\"You have no misgivings, my dear son.\"\n\"No, it is clear I must make my living in some practical way, and why\nnot by the law?\"\n\"There is the drudgery of the office first, and then the passing of\nexaminations.\"\n\"I have weighed all the pros and cons with you before; why do you go\nover them again?\" This was said in an irritable tone.\n\"I would as soon be a man of law as anything; and I want to make a\nhome\"--he paused--\"for _you_, and for one whom I have found under the\nMendips.\"\nHis mother had seated herself by his side, on a bench which stood in the\nverandah or balcony.\n\"It can't be thought of yet,\" he said; \"she is Falconer's sister! He\nnever told me he had a sister, or, rather, I should say, _such_ a\nsister. How should he be able to see what she is? I don't want to talk\nsentiment, mother, but I will say I did not know how beautiful and\nsimple hearted she was, and how her beauty was supreme with no fine\ndress, till I saw Gratian just now.\"\nHis mother laid her hand on his. \"What is her name, Gilbert?\"\n\"Joyce: it suits her as no other name could. Joyce!\" he repeated. \"Joy,\nSunshine, Birdie; they call her all these names at Fair Acres. Some day,\nwhen we are settled at Bristol, will you ask her to visit you, mother?\nand when you see her you will love her.\"\n\"I shall love her for your sake,\" his mother said, gently.",

The man knocked me down, and I returned the compliment, which\nis the cause of my stupidity to-day.\"\nHis mother scanned his face anxiously. \"Have you told her of your love?\"\n\"Not formally; but I feel she must know it.\"\n\"One word more, Gilbert, has she the _real_ spring of all beauty and\ngoodness within. Has she chosen the right path, following her Master?\"\nGilbert was silent for a minute.\n\"It is not a religious household,\" he said. \"They have no prayers,\nexcept on Sundays. It is a miserable church, with an old drone of a\nparson, who gallops through the service; but, I think, Joyce is ready to\nfollow, if led in the right way.\"\n\"And you are strong enough to lead, Gilbert?\"\n\"I hope so,\" he said earnestly; and then mother and son were silent for\na few minutes. Afterwards they began to speak of Melville, and all the\npast, in which Gilbert had borne such a noble part.\n\"I have separated him from Maythorne, and at least that is a step in the\nright direction; but he is so weak. How he came to be her brother, I\ncan't imagine; he is crazed on the subject of titles, and will roll off\na list of intimate friends, when he thinks I am not listening, to whom\nhe never spoke ten words in his life. I dined at the palace, and the\nbishop sent you his love, and so did his son, who lives with him--two\ncourteous gentlemen, with well-turned compliments at their tongue's end.\nThe bishop said I was like you, and that I had followed in the lines of\none of the most beautiful women he ever met.\"\n\"What bare-faced flattery!\" Mrs. Arundel said, laughing. \"I never was a\nbeauty. Your good looks come from the other side of the house.\"\n\"Who is flattering now?\" Gilbert asked; \"but seriously, mother, you\nshall accept an invitation to the Wells Palace, you must promise to do\nso. The bishop said something about November, if you did not mind the\nfalling leaves.\"\n\"I shall wait till I am asked,\" Mrs. Arundel said. \"If his lordship has\nburied me in the dust of years--out of sight and out of mind--I don't\nsee why he should unearth me now.\"\n\"And yet you sent your son to call you to mind; now that is unfair,\nmother. You urged me to go to the Palace at Wells, and now you won't\ntake advantage of what is growing out of it. But to go back to Falconer;\na stout, middle-aged gentleman, of small means and weak chest, wants to\ntravel for a year. The bishop suggested Mr. Falconer should give him his\nson to lead about, as he had previously washed several black sheep to a\nvery fair whiteness, paying expenses, but no further remuneration. If\nMelville can be got off under such auspices, it will be a grand step in\nthe right direction. Poor fellow! he has got into his head the absolute\nnecessity of seeing the world, and I, who know him pretty well, think\nthat there would be less danger of mischief if he were allowed to follow\nhis bent, than if he were to be forced to follow the pursuits of a\ncountry life at Fair Acres, which he thinks it grand to despise. He\ntalks with amazing coolness of all he shall do when he _does_ come, and\ntill he has learned a lesson, he would be a frightful nuisance to them\nall. The airs he gives himself to the poor old steward are preposterous;\nbut the worst thing about him is the way he speaks to his mother.\"",

Gilbert, there is never a cause or an excuse for wrath indulged;\nindignation against _wrong_ is one thing, rage against the wrong-doer\nanother.\"\nAnd now steps were heard in the hall, and Gratian's laugh. She threw\nopen the door and said in a half-mocking tone:\n\"My Lord Maythorne.\"\nMrs. Arundel advanced to meet her brother, and greeted him kindly, but\nwith no profession of extreme delight.\n\"Well, my dear sister,\" Lord Maythorne said, \"I have taken Clifton _en\nroute_ to Plymouth, and wandering aimlessly on the Downs I met your fair\nvisitor, my kinswoman, Gratian. What a quaint little snuggery you have\ngot, Annabella, upon my word; and Gratian tells me my hopeful nephew is\nhere, looking after his future prospects, eh? A little Methodism mixed\nwith law, eh?\" And Lord Maythorne produced an elegant gold snuff-box,\ntapped the lid, and took a delicate pinch between his forefinger and\nthumb, in the most approved fashion of the time.\n\"Ha! Gilbert, how do? Where is your cub, that you were leading about\nwith such good intentions. Have you brought him to introduce to your\nmother, eh?\" Waiting for no answer, and just touching Gilbert's hand\nwith his finger tips, he went on:\n\"Have you dined, Annabella?\"\n\"Long ago; we keep early hours.\"\n\"Well then, I'll return to my hotel to dine, and Gilbert shall accompany\nme.\"\n\"No thank you,\" Gilbert said, \"I shall sup with my mother, and go early\nto bed.\"\n\"You had better accept the invitation, Gilbert. Our supper will not be\nvery recherch\u00e9,\" Gratian said; \"we do not sit down to a royal feast\nhere, we live above such vanities.\"\n\"I dare say he will not be fastidious after his farmhouse life,\" said\nLord Maythorne, scornfully. \"How was your charge; is he walking without\nleading strings yet?\"\nGilbert bit his lip and struggled for composure; but his mother watched\nhim anxiously. Lord Maythorne's irony was hard for her to bear\nsometimes, and she never knew how Gilbert would take it.\n\"My dear boy, there is a wise proverb which in English sounds a little\nharsh, scarcely courteous; in French it is less abrupt: _'Chargez de vos\naffaires.'_ There are other renderings: 'Don't put your fingers into\nother people's pies.'\"\nPoor Gilbert sprang forward and raising his voice said:\n\"I will not submit to your impertinence. What right have you to treat me\nlike this? I saw you, a man almost double my age--\"\n\"Gently, gently my dear boy, not _double_; nay, nay--\"\n\"I say, I saw you trying to ruin a poor, weak fellow, who, weak as he\nwas, trusted you, and I tried to save him. I wonder you are not ashamed\nto speak thus; you are--\"\nThe fierce torrent of angry words suddenly stopped. His mother laid her\nhand upon his arm, and with a great effort he regained his composure.\n\"I beg your pardon, mother, for brawling here, in your presence, and in\nyours, Gratian, also; it is very unseemly.\"\nA mocking laugh from Lord Maythorne was his only response, and Gratian\nleft the room saying:\n\"Adieu! I hope to find you in a better temper at supper, Gilbert,\" which\nwas scarcely less irritating.\nGilbert followed her, and left his mother and her brother together.",

            "text": "Lord Maythorne was an utterly selfish man of the world; he was the son\nof his father's second marriage, and therefore much younger than Mrs.\nArundel. He was of the type very common in those days, of an openly\navowed scoffer at all that was good. Handsome, and with gentleman-like\nmanners when it suited him, he was unscrupulous as to truth, and could\nsend the shafts of his satire, dipped in gall, with a smiling face of\nindifference. He took a strange pleasure in entrapping the weak and the\nfoolish, and as we know, poor Melville Falconer had not escaped.\nGilbert had been roused to indignation against his uncle, and pity for\nhis victim, and he had done his best to open Melville's eyes, and had\nnot altogether failed.\nThe straightforward manliness of Gilbert had an attraction for many\nbesides Melville, and without any pretension or assumption of\nsuperiority, or many words about religion, he showed the Power that was\nin him was sufficient for him. His hot temper was governed, and a\ntorrent of angry words was often checked; while he did his best to\ntrample out the dislike it was impossible not to feel for his uncle.\nWhen Mrs. Arundel was left alone with her brother, he threw himself\ncarelessly on a sofa, and again drew out his snuff-box.\n\"So you have quite decided on the law for that boy,\" he said.\n\"Yes; this seems a good beginning here, and I have been able to article\nhim to a most respectable firm of solicitors.\"\n\"They are a dirty lot generally; however, I am glad that young fellow is\nreally going to earn his living, and make his own way in the world. It\nwould be a pity if he trusted to us.\"\n\"It is very unlikely he would trust to you,\" Mrs. Arundel said.\n\"It would be leaning on a broken reed, you think; well, I will not\ncontradict you, Annabella. In fact, I am a little short of cash, ready\ncash, just now. I suppose you do not happen to have a hundred pounds you\ndon't know what to do with?\"\n\"Certainly not; I cannot imagine, Maythorne, how you can think of such a\nthing.\"\n\"Well, I know you send a lot to convert the niggers and Hindoos, and\nthat you subscribe to a society for the flinging about of Bibles, which\nno one reads.\"\n\"Stop, please, Maythorne; I could not listen to any more conversation\nlike this; I will not take part in it. I can lend you no money; but once\nmore, for our father's sake, I cannot help begging, entreating you to\nturn from the ways of sin.\"\n\"No cant, please, Annabella; it makes me savage, and I don't want to\naffront you.\"\n\"I do not care whether you are affronted or not,\" Mrs. Arundel said,\nearnestly. \"I cannot help feeling that we are of the same blood, and\nthat if you were a worthy successor of my father you might be a joy and\nsupport to me. Instead of this, I have to try to keep my son from your\ninfluence, and dread that even by hearing your irreverent way of\ntreating sacred things, he may grow accustomed to what is wrong. Oh! it\nis not too late; you are still a young man, still in your prime; let me\nentreat you to break off the chains which bind you, or rather, turn to\nGod to free you from the bondage of sin--the _slavery_ of sin--for it is\nslavery, Maythorne.\"\n\"I am very much obliged to you, Annabella, for your kindly interest, but\nI rather prefer deeds to words. Maythornes is pretty well stripped of\ntrees now, and I have all but exhausted the possibility of raising money\non it; but _laisser aller_ is my motto, and I am not the one to mourn\nover a dark, old-fashioned house, and lands which yield no produce; if\npossible, I shall cut the whole concern. Well, ta-ta, till to-morrow. I\nhave promised to hire horses and trot out Gratian over the Downs.\"\nMrs. Arundel felt that to say anything more would be worse than useless,\nand yet, as she watched her brother lounge across the road and stand on\nthe slope looking over the river, her eyes filled with tears.\n\"To think what he _might_ have been. May God guard my boy from men like\nhim.\"\nGilbert had gone quickly away from Sion Hill, and found himself on the\nlower Downs--then not skirted by handsome houses, but with glades and\ngrassy slopes covered with hawthorn bushes, whitened in May-time with\nblossoms like snow, and covered in autumn with feathery masses of the\nwild clematis, or traveller's joy.\nGilbert found the place suited his mood, and he gave himself up to\nthoughts of Joyce, and forgot the late encounter with his uncle.",

            "text": "How delightful it was to build castles for the future--to think of a\nhome near all this loveliness, where Joyce would reign in all her sweet\nbeauty as his wife. The time had been when Gilbert had admired his\ncousin Gratian Anson, who was the daughter of his mother's aunt, and\ntherefore his cousin only in the second degree. Now her free, bold\nbearing, her ringing voice, her fashionable dress and banter, jarred on\nhim. Her laugh was like the rattle of a noisy brook over innumerable\nstones, when compared to Joyce's musical ripple, which was so real, and\nso entirely the outcome of her own happiness. Then how charming was her\nunconsciousness, and how her beauty was enhanced by the absence of all\naffectation; how pretty was her affection for her father and Piers, and\nhow gracefully and simply she did all the little household duties which\nher mother expected from her! Some words of a favourite poet of his\nmother's recurred to him, as he pictured Joyce in her little, short,\nlilac frock, with an apron, as he had seen her one morning, and her\nround white arms bare, as she came out of the dairy, and said she had\nmade up twenty pats of butter while he had been asleep. Surely George\nHerbert's words were verified.\nThe action was made fine by the spirit, which was done as a loving token\nof obedience to the will of another.\n\"Mother wished me to do it, so I got up an hour earlier,\" she had said,\nas she cut a slice from one of the rolls made for breakfast and offered\nit to him, spread with the butter she had made, with a cup of milk,\nbefore it had been skimmed.\nDreams of first love are very sweet; and Gilbert wondered if he had been\nwise to leave Fair Acres without getting a definite answer from Joyce\nherself.\nHonourable and straightforward, he determined not to return to Fair\nAcres unless prepared to ask her father's permission to lay all he had\nat her feet. He was conscious that at present that _all_ did not imply\nmuch, and besides, he had his mother to think of, and he must not marry\ntill he was really in a position to support a wife in that station of\nlife to which he had been called. He could wait for seven years, like\nJacob of old--waiting for Joyce was worth any sacrifice. But what if,\nwhen she emerged from her retirement and went to Barley Wood, some one\nelse might set his heart on the prize and win it. Then he recalled her\nwords, spoken in answer to his question as he carried her towards home\nthe evening before:\n\"No; I will not forget you.\"\nThey seemed to possess a double meaning as he repeated them again and\nagain, as he retraced his steps over the observatory towards Sion Hill.\nThey were heard in the late voices of the thrushes in the woods across\nthe river--those dark, mysterious Leigh woods which, in the dim and\nfading light, clothed the opposite heights with dim and motionless\nmasses; they were heard in the call of the sailor boys from the full\nriver below St. Vincent's Rock, on whose summit he stood; they seemed to\nwrap him round with a certainty that the giant rock, from which he\nlooked over the fading landscape lying to his left, encircled by a line\nof hills, on which the fine tower of Dundry stood like a black sentinel\nagainst the clear sky, was not more steadfast than would Joyce's heart\nbe, were it once given to him.\nThere were then no railings to protect passers-by from approaching too\nnear the edge of the precipice which falls sheer down from this point a\ndistance of three hundred feet, and Gilbert was startled from his dream\nby a voice near:\n\"You are perilously near the edge, unless you wish to go over!\"\nHe turned with a sudden gesture, and, to his surprise, saw Gratian.\n\"I saw you wander over here from my window,\" she said. \"Look! there are\nour houses, and I came to look after you.\"\n\"That was very obliging,\" Gilbert said, a little satirically.\n\"Now, don't be so high and mighty. I wish to be your friend, as I have\nalways been, Gilbert. I was very sorry for you when you were so\nshamefully teazed by your young uncle; he does not like to be called\n_old_. I hope you noticed that.\"\n\"Oh! it is over now. I had no right to get into a rage.\"\n\"I think you had every right,\" Gratian said. \"He is too provoking;\nworse, since he has been so much in London, and welcomed, so we hear, by\nsome boon companions of His Majesty. But do not let us talk of him; let\nus talk of you. No; I don't choose to walk so near the edge of the\nrocks, if you do. Tell me about the people where you have been;--tell me\nabout the place. Is it a fine house, or a nice big farm? Fair Acres is a\npretty name, and are there no fair maidens as well as acres? Come,\nGilbert, you were not always so cross to me.\" This was said with a\ngentle pressure on his arm.\n\"I don't mean to be cross; but there is nothing at Fair Acres that would\ninterest you. You know about poor Melville already.\"\n\"I have heard of him,\" she said, \"and of your taking upon yourself to\nreform him. Well, who are the others?\"\n\"There are two fine boys, who want to be sailors, but they are too old,\nI am afraid, for the navy; they are thirteen.\"\n\"They--both thirteen!\"\n\"Yes, they are twins. Then there is a lame boy, Piers, a year younger.\nAnd oh, I forgot! a quiet, silent fellow, Ralph, he is sixteen.\"\n\"And does the great Melville, come next to him?\"\n\"Two little girls died. But there is a daughter of seventeen.\"\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Gratian; \"I knew there was a daughter. Did I not tell\nyou I knew you were in love? Tell me her name. Come! We are such old\nfriends. Surely you might tell me.\"\n\"Really, Gratian, I will tell you Miss Falconer's name if you so\nparticularly wish to hear it. I--\"\n\"I will guess it. Let me see. I love my love with an A, because she is\namiable, and I took her to the sign of the Archer, and fed her with\napples, and her name is Angela. Not right? Well, I will go through the\nalphabet, and I must surely be right at last. I love my love with a\nB----.\"\n\"Pray stop,\" Gilbert said. \"I don't feel in a jesting mood, somehow.\"\n\"Not ready to wear a cap and bells? Poor Gilbert. You feel more like\nsitting under a willow tree and singing 'Poor Mary Anne.'\"\n\"Which is our house?\" Gilbert asked.\n\"Not that one; not up the steps. But you shall not go in till you tell\nme her name.\"\n\"She is called Joyce,\" Gilbert said, in despair.\n\"Ah! then you allow there is only one _she_ for you in all the world,\nand _she_ is called Joyce.\"\n\"Now, I do hope you are satisfied,\" Gilbert said.\nShe laughed that loud, ringing laugh, as she ran upstairs before him.\n\"Oh! of course I am satisfied,\" she said.\n[Illustration]",

Her aunt gave her orders as to what\nshe was to wear every day; how she was to be sure to make a proper\ncurtsey at the door of the drawing-room when she entered Mrs. More's\npresence; that she was to play on the piano, and exhibit the screens she\nhad just painted; and if Mrs. More admired them, she was to beg her to\ndo her the favour to accept them.\n\"Do not let Joyce commit herself by any rustic manners; you who have\nbeen carefully educated, my dear Charlotte, must try to do me credit,\nand give Joyce a hint--\"\n\"Joyce is so lovely!\" Charlotte exclaimed, \"it scarcely matters what she\nsays, or wears.\"\n\"My dear, Joyce has no _style_, and is given to express herself too\nfreely; and, I _think_, her voice is sometimes pitched in too high a\nkey. Yours is gentle and well modulated; now do me credit at Barley\nWood, Charlotte; I have taken so much pains to form you on the model of\na true gentlewoman; and you must remember how many girls would think it\na great honour to pay a visit to Mrs. Hannah More.\"\nCharlotte promised to do her best; and when her uncle called to take her\nto the \"Swan,\" where the four-wheel was waiting, she was in a flutter of",

            "text": "excitement.\nMr. Falconer greeted his sister in his usual frank kindly manner; and\nwhile Charlotte ran upstairs to get ready, Miss Falconer said:\n\"I am glad to hear Melville is gone.\"\nThe squire sighed.\n\"Yes, he is gone, and his mother finds it hard to part from him.\"\n\"Hard to part from him! Really, Arthur, when one considers how much\nanxiety he has caused, I wonder you should say that.\"\n\"Ah! Letitia, that is all very well; but mothers' hearts are the same,\nwhether their sons are good or bad. It seems to me that mothers\ngenerally love the children best, that give them the most trouble.\nHowever, the poor fellow is gone, bag and baggage. I went to Bath with\nhim, and delivered him over to Mr. Crawford, a steady-going man he\nseems, and Melville will not have a chance of getting into mischief\nunder his care, I hope. But it is an expensive matter. I had to put a\nhundred pounds into Crawford's keeping as a start; besides twenty I gave\nMelville.\"\n\"You ought not to have given him more than five pounds,\" Miss Falconer\nsaid. \"The whole management of Melville has been a mistake.\"\n\"So you have told me before,\" said the squire. \"My dear Letitia, single\nwomen always think they know a great deal about the affairs of married\npeople, and, as experience is wanting, they commonly know nothing.\"\n\"I have long since given up arguing the point with you, Arthur; however,\nlet us say no more. I only hope that Melville may return a changed\ncharacter, and then you will not regret this outlay for him. I only wish\nJoyce had some of the money spent on _her_.\"\n\"Joyce!\" the squire exclaimed--a smile breaking over his fine face;\n\"Joyce! all the money in the world could not improve her. She is my joy\nand comfort. I half grudge letting her go to Barley Wood, even for a\nshort visit.\"\n\"You ought to be glad that she has had such an invitation; and, really,\nyou have to thank me for it, Arthur. I take such a deep interest in\nJoyce. I have often tried to put before you what she needs, and now I\nhave great hope that Mrs. More may suggest some plan for her.\"\nThe squire began to feel very impatient; his sister's interest in his\nchildren was undoubted, but he did not want to have it perpetually\nbrought before him. Miss Falconer had an unfortunate habit of sounding\nher own excellencies, especially with regard to her nieces and nephews.\nThen there were often little side hits at his wife; and it is always\nhard for a man like the squire, to be reminded that his sisters do not\nconsider his wife their equal in the social scale, and the nearer the\ntruth the less palatable is the assertion of it.\n\"Is not Charlotte ready?\" he exclaimed. \"Joyce will be waiting at\nDraycot, where we are to pick her up. Thomas was to drive her there with\nher box, as he had an errand at Farmer Scott's.\"\n\"In what did Joyce drive?\"\n\"In the gig; and Joyce likes to pay Mrs. Scott, who is a sad cripple, a\nvisit sometimes, so it all fitted in very well. Come Charlotte, my\ndear,\" he said, turning to his niece. \"We shall find the four-wheel at\nthe 'Swan,' and I've the ostler at the Close gate waiting to take your\nluggage. Two boxes! Joyce only took one.\"\n\"Charlotte was obliged to have a bonnet-box,\" her aunt said. \"Her\nTuscan bonnet would have been ruined with the dust if she had worn it.\"\nThe squire was already in the little lobby, and, cutting short\ngood-byes, he strode down the Close, while Charlotte ran back twice, to\nkiss her aunt and say in a tearful voice:\n\"I cannot endure to leave you, sweet auntie.\"\n\"Good-bye, my treasure, good-bye,\" Miss Falconer repeated again and\nagain, and very genuine tears were on her own cheeks. They were a very\ndemonstrative pair, and, as we should say in these days, \"gushed\" over\neach other, but real love did underlie the fanciful expression of it;\nand Miss Falconer looked on Charlotte with the pride that a modeller in\nplastic clay, looks upon the work of his hands, and remembers how\ncarefully every detail has been wrought out, and how, in spite of a\nlittle flaw here and there, the result is satisfactory.\nJoyce was watching for her father at the door of Mr. Scott's farm, and\ncame running down the garden between the lavender bushes and high\nshrub-fuschias, which were glowing scarlet in the sunshine.\nThe squire waved his hand to the farmer's wife, who, crippled with\nrheumatism, could not leave her seat in the porch to come towards him. A\nfarmboy lifted Joyce's box to the back seat, where she soon mounted\nwith a quick, alert spring, and then, with a shilling handed to the boy,\nthe squire drove off.",

It is a good many\nmiles for Mavis at a stretch.\"\nThey drew up at the door, and an old servant answered the ringing of the\nbell, which Joyce had jumped down to pull by a handle, made of a deer's\nfoot. The servant's face was not very pleasant, and a forbidding looking\nwoman called out:\n\"Company! yes, there's nothing but company. There's no rest from it.\"\nThe boxes were taken down, and the squire, unwilling to prolong the\nparting, which he felt more keenly than he cared to own, waved his whip,\nand saying \"Good bye, my Sunshine, good-bye,\" drove off.\n\"This way,\" the woman said, passing across the hall and opening the door\nof a low, pretty room, sweet with that scent of rose leaves and\nlavender, which always belonged to the atmosphere of a country house\nlong ago.

There was an air\nof tranquility about it, and an absence of anything like fashion or\nshow, which was very refreshing.\nMiss Frowde rose to greet the two girls, and, saying that Mrs. More\nwould see them after dinner, she led them to two rooms at the back of\nthe house, near the servants' quarters.\n\"The house will be full next week for the Bible meeting at Wrington, so\nwe thought you would not object to these rooms.

Joyce, accustomed to her mother's scrupulous care about every\nlittle detail, noticed that the counterpane on her bed was a good deal\nrumpled, and there were rims of dust on the bosses of the old-fashioned\nround mirror. Evidently the servants at Barley Wood had not taken much\ntrouble about the guests.\nIndeed, the shameful neglect of Mrs. More's servants, and their bad\nconduct, had even then been canvassed by outsiders, though the old lady\nherself was perfectly unconscious of it.",

It will only be one at a time; she is husbanding her strength for\nthe Bible meeting, when seventeen or eighteen friends will dine here.\"\nPresently one of the maid servants came into the room.\n\"Mrs. More wishes to see Miss _Fork_ner, and I was to say that the other\nmight go into the village with you, Miss Frowde, if she pleased.\"\n\"You had better go immediately,\" Miss Frowde said to Joyce. \"Dear Mrs.\nMore does not like to be kept waiting.\"\nJoyce rose at once and followed the maid to a small sitting room, where\nMrs. More was seated in a deep armchair.\nA large table was near her, covered with books and papers, and a small\nfire burned upon the hearth.\nJoyce felt as if she were going into the presence of royalty, and far\nmore in awe of Mrs. More, than she had done when offering her the milk\nat the carriage door, before Fair Acres.\nIndeed Hannah More had a certain queenly dignity about her, and the\nreflection of those palmy days when she was the admired of all admirers\nin the gay London world, the friend of Garrick and the great Dr.\nJohnson, did, in some degree, remain with her always.\nThe spiritual life in which she had lived and moved for so many years,\nhad lifted her far above the interests and pursuits which once she held\nto be the end and aim of life. Her religion was eminently practical, and\nto do good and to communicate was never forgotten. Nevertheless, the\nliterary efforts which had made her famous, her brilliant conversation,\nher intellectual powers, had given her a certain tone and dignity, which\nwhile attractive, might yet be called the air of superiority, which in\nthose days was conceded, to be as quite the proper attitude for any\nwoman who had made herself a name. Now, in the great crowd of authors\nand craftswomen of the pen, it is hard for anyone to lift her head above\nher neighbours.\nA thing of the past indeed it is to remember how famous \"the little\nBurney,\" as Dr. Johnson called her, became; how flattery was poured upon\nher, how no one dared to be jealous, because no one would dare to\nemulate her performances. To be great in London Society in Hannah More's\nearly days, was to be great indeed. The author of \"Percy\" was presented\nwith a laurel crown, the stems confined within an elegant ring, and\nGarrick himself read aloud the play to a select circle of admiring\nlisteners!\nBut though history repeats itself, and fashion ruled then as now, in\nliterature as in other things, I think there was more honest and kindly\nappreciation of the work of others than we have now-a-days.\nThe literary field was narrower, it is true, and therefore was not\nbroken up into plots, each plot hedged in by various conceits--a barrier\nthe uninitiated cannot pass. All flowers growing outside the barrier\nare called weeds; and if they are fragrant, they are pronounced sickly;\nif bright and vivid in colour, common. I may be wrong, but I think this\nself-sufficient, dogmatic criticism is very much on the increase, and\nthat the little jealousies and rivalries amongst men and women who\nfollow the same profession in art or literature grow more frequent.\nTongue and pen are often both too sharp; and the superficial chatter\nabout books and authors, pictures and music--both English and\nforeign--is too often passed as the real coin of the great realm of\nliterature, when it is but a base imitation, stamped, it may be, on a\nshowy surface with the same token, but utterly worthless when the first\nbrilliancy is worn off.\n\"Come, my dear Miss Falconer,\" was Mrs. More's greeting to Joyce; \"come\nand sit near me, that we may have a pleasant chat. Tell me how you have\nsped since I saw you, and whether you have studied the Book I gave you.\"\n\"Yes, madam,\" Joyce said, as she seated herself on a high Chippendale\nchair, the seat covered with fine cross-stitch, close to Mrs. More;\n\"yes, madam, I have read all the passages you marked; and I had no\nnotion before that the Bible was so beautiful.\"\n\"Ah, my child, it is a deep mine; its treasures do not lie on the\nsurface; and let me tell you that I, who have drunk of the waters at\nmany springs, find in the Bible alone, the living fountain of water.\nYour aunt told me she was anxious as to your education; she thought you\nneeded more than your good father found it convenient to give you.\"\n\"Father has so many boys,\" Joyce said, \"and, of course, boarding schools\nare very expensive. I have had to help mother a great deal at home, and\nI never wished to go to school. I think Aunt Letitia means by education\naccomplishments like Charlotte's, and I have none of them. But,\" Joyce\nwent on, \"I have a very clever brother, Ralph, and, when he is at home\nfor the holidays, I write his Latin exercises, and he corrects them, and\nI can read French with him; and then I know a good deal of natural\nhistory--because my brother Piers is lame, and nothing amuses him like\ncollections of birds, and moths, and insects.\"\n\"Well,\" Hannah More said, smiling, \"I think you have laid a very good\nfoundation; upon this, as you grow older, you can build up many fair\ntemples of knowledge, and I hope they will be ornamented by wisdom. You\nknow my story, I dare say.\"\nJoyce hesitated, \"I know you write plays and books. We have 'Christian\nMorals,' and 'Village Politics.' But----\"\n\"Oh,\" Hannah More said, \"those are my published works. I was alluding to\nthe story of my own life. I always like to bring it before the young,\nbecause I can say to them, I have tasted all the world can give, and\nfound it vanity. My dear, if I were now depending on the favours of the\ngreat for happiness, or the showering upon me of the fame which my\nliterary work brought me, where should I be? An old woman in her\neightieth year, can no longer dine with bishops and princes of the land.\nShe can take no part in routs, and theatres would be a weariness; but,\nthank God, and I beg you, my child, to mark this, I turned from those\nvanities to strive to serve the living God when I was in my heyday. And\nwhy? Because I felt them then to be _but_ vanity, often vexation of\nspirit, and the higher part of me loathed the false lustre of the gay\nworld.\"\nJoyce listened attentively to every word Mrs. More said, and her young\nheart gave in its allegiance to the beautiful old lady who, in her own\nbrilliant style, told her of the days of her youth, and of many little\nincidents connected with the names of distinguished men and women who\nhad passed away.\n\"I expected opposition,\" she said with a sigh, \"but we were a fourfold\nband of sisters then, and we could meet a legion of objectors with a\nbright face. Now, I alone am left, and can no longer give personal care\nto the work. But I have kindled the spark, with God's help, and I do\ntrust the light will shine over the hills of Somersetshire when I am\nlaid in yonder churchyard. The Mendip miners give me the most\nuneasiness; they are so rough, and wild, and lawless.\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said. \"We, that is, Mr. Arundel and I, met the man who had\nbeen brought before the magistrates at Wells, and he knocked down Mr.\nArundel, and----\"\n\"I heard of that. Poor Susan Priday, the man's daughter, has been a good\ngirl, and has had a sad life indeed.\"\n\"I felt so sorry for her,\" Joyce said, \"and I should like to help her.\nShe must be so unhappy with a bad father. If mother would let me, I\nshould like to have her in the kitchen; but I know she would not allow\nit.\"\nMrs. More smiled.\n\"I suppose your good mother thinks the education in our school has\nspoiled Susan for service.\n\"Mother is a good mistress,\" Joyce ventured to say, \"and cares for the\nmaids, as maids, but she has a notion that people who have to earn their\nbread, ought not to be able to read.\"\n\"Ah! that is a notion many have shared with your mother. Why, when the\ngreat Edward Colston first proposed to begin the good work of education\nin Bristol, he was voted by the Mayor and Aldermen as a dangerous\nperson, likely to turn the sons of the poor into vipers, who should\nsting the rich when once they were raised out of ignorance. All that\nfeeling has passed away in Bristol, as it will pass away in time in the\ncountry districts. Edward Colston's name is held now in honour; his\nschool sends out useful members of society year by year. Then there is\nRobert Raikes at Gloucester, how his work has taken root. So I comfort\nmyself with thinking that before this century has counted out its last\nyear, Hannah More's schools for the sons of the soil under Mendip, will\nhave won their way humbly but steadily to swell the great tide of\nprogress which is bearing us on its breast. It is a wonderful age!\" she\ncontinued. \"God has shown us marvellous things. Steam has become our\nservant, and its concentrated force seems likely to move kingdoms, and\nverify the prophecy that men shall go to and fro on the earth. Then in\nour cities coal-gas is captured, and turns night into day. Who shall say\nwhat hidden forces yet lie undiscovered, needing only the brain to\nconceive, and the hand of some Watt to demonstrate the power, lying\nconcealed in the mysteries of God's natural kingdom. Who was with you\non Mendip when the rough fellow attacked you?\"\n\"Mr. Arundel,\" Joyce said, in a low voice, the colour rising to her\nface.\nHannah More smiled, and said:\n\"Was he your _preux chevalier_?\"\nJoyce blushed a still rosier red.\n\"I don't understand,\" she said, simply.\n\"Your devoted knight!\"\n\"Of course, how stupid; but I so seldom hear French spoken; and I expect\nRalph and I have a strange pronunciation.\"\n\"French pronunciation can only be acquired by much speaking; and now\nfinish the story of your knight.\"\n\"Oh, it was only that the man, Susan's father, was angry, and wanted to\nforce me to give him money; and Mr. Arundel made him move out of the\nway, and then, of course, the man was furious, and hurled him down upon\nthe heather and gorse. We had lost our way, and father had to come out\nwith two men, and lanthorns to look for us.\"\nAll the time Joyce was speaking she felt those dark eyes were fixed on\nher, and she hurried on to the end of her story. Hannah More was too\nkeen an observer of faces not to read what was written on Joyce's; but\nshe only stroked the fair, rounded cheek gently, and said; \"We shall be\nfriends, I hope; there is only a short space in earth left for me, but,\nlong or short, you may reckon on my sympathy. We will talk about\neducation to-morrow. I have some letters demanding attention. That pile\nis yet unread; many are begging letters, some are even less pleasant\nthan that;\" and the old lady sighed. Even then the dishonesty and\nextravagance of her household were beginning to be noticed outside\nBarley Wood. Although her own eyes were blinded as to the cause, she\nfelt the results keenly.\nThis first day at Barley Wood was the beginning of a new life to Joyce.\nWhile Charlotte in her secret heart found the country dull, and almost\nwished herself back in Wells, a new world opened for Joyce. Mrs. More\nwould recite passages from Milton's \"Paradise Lost,\" and fill Joyce's\nmind with the beauties of the Garden of Eden, till she had thoughts for\nnothing else. Mrs. More told her she reminded her of a great man who on\nreading Milton for the first time, said he forgot that there was anyone\nelse in the world but himself and Adam and Eve!\nCharlotte dawdled over a bit of fancy work, which her aunt had hoped\nwould awake Mrs. More's admiration, but as it met with but faint praise,\nCharlotte felt herself aggrieved, and made various uncomplimentary\nremarks, in private, upon the coarse aprons which Miss Frowde produced\nas needlework which was _really_ wanted. But the stories of London life\npleased Charlotte, and she would wake up to interest when Mrs. More\ndescribed the grand routs where the \u00e9lite of London were gathered; of\nJohnson and his witty speeches; of Garrick, and of the continual round\nof gaiety which she had led, till she awoke from a dream to realities,\nand from those vanities to serve the living God.\nThe Bible meeting at Wrington was the great event of the year, and the\nvillage was in holiday trim. The bells rang from the noble church tower;\nthe school children, in clean white tippets and blue cotton frocks,\nwalked in procession to Barley Wood, where tea was provided for parents\nand teachers, and several of those who had come to the meeting addressed\nthem in simple words. Sir Thomas Acland had brought with him the Bishop\nof Ohio, and the good old man looked upon the scene before him, with\neyes dim with emotion. Here in this Somersetshire village, lying under\nthe range of low hills, had the influence of a good woman been felt. She\nhad borne bitter scoffs and rudeness from her enemies; she had been\nlaughed at even by her friends, and yet she had carried the banner of\nthe Lord onward, and now in her old age the victory was won. The people\nloved her, and though there were malcontents in Wrington, as in every\nother place, still the feeling for the good work the four sisters had\ndone, was stronger than that which was against it, and the Bible had\nbecome a treasure in many humble homes. No longer like that of which\nJoyce had spoken at Fair Acres--rarely opened and seldom read--nor like\nthe one described by Hannah More herself as the only one she found at\nCheddar, used to prop up a flower-pot in the window!\nThere was a large dinner-party of seventeen at Barley Wood after the\nmeeting, and this was a novelty to the two girls, who had never before\nsat down with so many at a table. Charlotte was in good spirits, having\ncaptured a pale-faced young clergyman, to whom she talked in her\nsentimental fashion, and who seemed almost as much fascinated by her, as\nshe intended he should be.\nJoyce, on the contrary, had no time to think of herself. She was\nintently listening to all that was said, and the conversation of those\nrefined and educated gentlemen charmed her. It was impossible not to be\nstruck with her beautiful face, glowing with interest and, though silent\nherself, showing that she was drinking in all that was said around her.",

She seemed to try to do all she\ncould, and--\"\nThe Bishop turned quickly. Joyce almost thought she ought not to have\nspoken, and that the Bishop and Mrs. More would think her forward, but\nthe good old man said:\n\"That is right, my dear young lady. It is well to remind our dear friend\nthat the grains she has scattered are not all in vain. Some will fall on\nthe good ground, and by God's blessing spring up and bear fruit. Who is\nSusan Priday?\"\n\"Come nearer the Bishop, Joyce,\" Mrs. More said, kindly, \"and tell him\nyour experience of Mendip miners, and of Susan also.\"\nJoyce did as she was told, and soon forgot her nervousness at being\ncalled upon to talk to so great a person as a Bishop, as she narrated\nwith sweet simplicity, and yet with dramatic power, the story which we\nalready know.\nBy degrees the voices of people in other parts of the room ceased, and\nJoyce found herself the centre of interest as she told her story.\n\"Who is she?\" Sir Thomas Acland asked, as Joyce finished her story, and\nanswered a summons from Miss Frowde at the further end of the room.\nFailing a little in the good manners, on which Miss Falconer put so high\na value, Charlotte answered a question _not_ addressed to her.\n\"She is my cousin, sir--Joyce Falconer. She has led a very retired life\nat Fair Acres.\"\n\"There are many flowers that bloom unseen, and she is one of the fairest\nI ever saw. If a retired life produces such good effect, it strikes me,\nMrs. More, we had all better go into retirement. But--\"\nHe stopped, for Joyce, with a white face from which every vestige of\ncolour had vanished, came back to her position by Mrs. More's chair. Her\nhands were clasped tightly together, her whole attitude one of\nrepressed emotion.\n\"If you please, Mrs. More, I must beg you to excuse me. I am sent for to\ngo home, for my father--Oh! my father!--is dying.\"\nMiss Frowde was close behind Joyce.\n\"You must not agitate dear Mrs. More,\" she said. \"I will take care of\nMiss Falconer,\" she added. \"The gig is waiting.\"\n\"Do you know any particulars?\"\nMiss Frowde shook her head, and was leading Joyce away, when she\nsuddenly turned back.\n\"Dear madam, dear Mrs. More, please pray for me;\" and, unable to resist\nthe impulse, she threw her arms round the old lady's neck.\n\"Miss Falconer, indeed you must restrain your emotion; you will agitate\ndear Mrs. More.\"\nBut Hannah More held the trembling form of the poor stricken child\nclose.\n\"My dear,\" she whispered, \"many are the sorrows through which I have\npassed, and He whom I trust has never forsaken me. Trust in Him, and to\nHis loving kindness I commend you.\"\nJoyce raised herself from the old lady's arms, and the Bishop, deeply\nmoved, laid his hand upon her head.\n\"The Lord bless you and keep you, my child, now and evermore.\"",

Once they passed a small farm where a\nmother, neatly dressed, was standing at the gate, and a girl of fourteen\nran out to meet a man with her baby brother in her arms, who stretched\nout his hands as the girl said:\n\"Yes, there's daddy! Go to daddy; welcome, daddy!\"\nAh! how often had Joyce watched for her father at the gate! How her\nheart had thrilled with joy as she ran to meet him; and now!\nA low cry escaped her, which made Thomas turn his head, which he had\nhitherto kept steadily to the front, as if everything depended on his\nstaring straight between the ears of the horse, and never looking to the\nright hand, or the left.\nThomas was a hard featured man, who had served the old squire, and to\nwhom Mr. Falconer was still \"Master Arthur.\" \"Doan't ee fret, my dear\nMiss Joyce.

Joyce sprang down and\npassed in, throwing off her large bonnet, and unfastening the clasp of\nher cloak, which seemed like to choke her.\nIn the supreme moments of life the most trivial things always seem to\nfasten upon the outward senses, as if to show, by force of contrast, the\nenormous proportions of the great trouble--or the great joy, it may\nbe--which is at the time overshadowing us.\nSo Joyce, as she stood in the hall, noticed that one of the stag's\nglass eyes had dropped out and lay upon the bench upon which Gilbert\nArundel had sat on the night of their adventure on the moor. She saw,\ntoo, lying there, a large pair of scissors, and a roll of lint lay on\nthe window-seat, with a basin in which the water was coloured a pale\ncrimson. \"They bandaged his head here,\" she thought,--and she was going\nupstairs, when slow, heavy, jerky footsteps were heard, and Duke came\ndown, and, putting his nose into her hand, whined a low, piteous whine.\n\"Oh! Duke, Duke, where is he?\"\nAs if he understood her human speech--as, indeed, he did, Duke turned to\nprecede her upstairs.\nOn a bench in the long corridor two maid servants were seated, crying\nbitterly. But Joyce did not speak to them, she dared not; even the\nquestion she had asked Duke died on her lips.\nThe door of her father's room was ajar; and as Duke pushed it open with\nhis nose, Joyce could see the great four-post bed, her mother sitting by\nit, and curled up in the window-seat was Piers.\nThe friends who had been there in the early part of the day were gone;\nthey could do no more at Fair Acres. And Mr. Paget's aim was to set the\nconstables to work to find the man who must have hurled a sharp stone at\nMr. Falconer's head. The Wells doctor, too, was gone. He had a pressing\ncase near Wells upon his hands, but he was to return at eight o'clock,\nwhen, it was hoped the doctor greater than himself, who had been\nsummoned from Bristol, would have arrived.\nIn those days help in emergency was slow to obtain. Telegrams were not\ndreamed of, and horsepower performed the part which steam was soon to\ntake up; to be followed by the marvellous electric force, which now\nsends on the wings of the wind messages all over the world, multiplied,\non the very day on which I write, to an enormous extent, by the\nintroduction of sixpenny telegrams, which will send a call for help, or\nstrike a note of joy, and win an immediate response from thousands.\nBut there were no electric messages possible to get medical help for the\nsquire, nor, indeed, would any help avail.\nWith a great sigh, Duke resumed his watch at the foot of the high bed;\nand Joyce, crossing over, kissed her mother and Piers, and then gazed\ndown upon her father.\n\"Dear dad!\" she said, inadvertently using the familiar name.",

Yes, it\nis an old-world name, but I fancy it; name her Joyce.\"\nThe sound of his master's voice roused Duke, who pricked his ears and\ncame to the bedside. Mrs. Falconer also started and awoke.\n\"There is a word I cannot catch, about the _Life_. Try to think of it. I\ncan't.\"\nJoyce glanced at her mother.\n\"What does he mean?\" she said, helplessly. \"Oh! what does he want?\"\n\"The Life; I am the Life.\" The words came with difficulty now.\nThen Piers, starting up, said:\n\"I know. I think I know. 'Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the\n_Life_.'\"\nA smile of infinite content came over the father's face.\n\"_Yes_,\" he said. \"Yes, the Life.\"\nPresently he murmured Melville's name, and those of the children who had\ngone before.\n\"The little girls all died but _one_,\" he said. \"One is left--Sunshine.\"\nThey knelt down as in the presence of something unseen but near; for the\nshadows gathered on the fine face of the husband and father; and Piers\nrepeated for the second time:\n\"Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the Life!\"\nAs if with a great effort to repeat the words, the squire said, faintly,\n\"Jesus said,\"--then silence fell; and the next thing Joyce knew was\nthat she was lying in her own little bed, and that she was fatherless.",

The beautiful tie between father and daughter, which when it\nexists is one of the most beautiful in the world, seemed severed,\ncruelly severed, and Joyce was desolate. She was scarcely eighteen, and\nthe freshness and gladness of her life hitherto had been remarkable.\nNow, all unawares, the storm had swept over her sky, and, when it\npassed, left her lonely indeed.\nMrs. Falconer was one of those people who bury their dead out of sight,\nand cannot bear the mention of their names. Ralph, setting his face\nbravely to meet his duty, did not speak of his father as Joyce would\nhave loved to speak of him, and it was only to Piers, that Joyce could\nsometimes ease her burdened heart, by talking of her father. Just as on\nthe summer morning, now looking so far off, left in the golden haze of\njoy and glad young life, Joyce had seen her lame brother at the gate of\nthe plantation, so she saw him now.\nShe made a great effort to control her weeping, and said:\n\"It is very slippery on the turf to-day; wait, dear, and I will come\ndown to help you.\" But Piers said:\n\"I want _you_ to come down; I don't want to come up.\"\n\"Is anything the matter?\"\nPiers did not answer, and in another minute Joyce was at his side.\n\"Joyce, there is a woman hiding under the maples and brambles.\"\n\"A woman? Perhaps she is one of the women employed on the farm.\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Piers, \"I wish you would come and see who it is.\"\n\"Very well, dear,\" Joyce said; \"you are sure it is a _woman_?\"\n\"Yes, and she is crying and sobbing.\"\nJoyce followed Piers along the shrubbery path, now covered with a new\nlayer of fallen leaves, and, at the turn of a still narrower side path,\nshe saw, half hidden by the brambles and undergrowth, a woman; her head,\nbowed upon her hands, and her attitude one of despair.\nJoyce went near and said: \"What is the matter? Are you in pain? Can I\nhelp you?\"\nThe woman raised her head, and Joyce recognised at once that she was\nSusan Priday.\nThoughts of the night on Mendip; of the fierce onslaught made on Gilbert\nArundel by the big giant, and the almost certainty she felt, that the\ncruel blow aimed at her father was by the same hand, made Joyce start\nback and say, coldly:\n\"You had better not stay here, these are private grounds.\"\nPiers, who was leaning against the bole of a beech tree, said:\n\"Yes; get up and go away. I will show you the gate into the road.\"\n\"Lady,\" said the girl, passionately, \"I came to see _you_. I saw you\nsobbing and crying on the bench yonder, for I got into the plantation\nthat way. I heard you sob, and call 'Father,' and then my heart nearly\nbroke, and I came round at the back and got over the hedge. I felt as if\nI dare not speak to you. Do you know me, lady?\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said; \"of course I see who you are, but I--I cannot do\nanything for you, and we are all in great grief, very, very great\ngrief,\" Joyce said, with a sudden spasm of agony in her voice.\n\"I know it, I know it, that's why I came; and I'm in grief, too. Father\nis gone away, no one knows where; the boys have run off, and, oh! the\nbaby is dead. I did think I'd keep him, for mother's sake; but, in a\ndrunken fit, father threw a pot of boiling water at me. It missed me,\nand the baby caught it on his neck and face, and it scalded him\ndreadful. The school mistress was kind, and so was Mrs. Amos, she that\nowns the farm; but he died--he died--and I am all alone. Oh! Miss, oh!\ndear young lady, pity me.\"\n\"I do pity you,\" Joyce said. \"But where is your father? For you must be\naware that suspicion points to him as the cause of my--of my dear\nfather's death.\"\n\"Yes, I do know it. Oh! miss, forgive me, and let me come and serve\nyou. I want no wage; but I'd die for you, if that would do you good. I\nhave never forgot your face that night, nor how you spoke soft then\ninstead of angry. Oh, miss, let me come and live with you. I will sleep\non the ground. I'll do the work of two in the dairy, or in the house,\nand I want no wage. Poor mother always said God would take care of me,\nbut He has taken away the baby, He has, that is the cruellest part. And\nfather; oh! miss, you can't tell what it is to be filled with shame\nabout a father.\"\n\"No, indeed,\" Joyce said. \"No; I know what it is to be proud of one, and\nto----\" Her voice broke down, and Piers said:\n\"She ought to go away, Joyce; she can't be left here.\"\nBut Joyce seemed to be thinking for a few minutes. Here was a girl whose\nfather had, as everyone thought, been the cause of her father's death;\nhere was the daughter of this man, coming to her and begging to be taken\ninto the house, to be her servant? Was it possible?\nWith a discretion far beyond her years, Joyce said, \"I will make\ninquiries about you from the school mistress, and if I find you really\nbear a good character, I will get you a place, and----\"\n\"I want no place apart from _you_\" the girl said, passionately. \"If I\ncould die to undo my father's wicked deed, I would die, and,\" she added,\nsadly, \"it ain't much I have to live for now the baby's gone. But if you\nwon't take me, well, I'll tramp to Bristol; and if I can't get bread in\nan honest way, I must get it somehow else.\"\n\"No, no; don't say that. I must consider and think, and if I can take",

But I will _think_, and,\" she added, in a\nlow voice, \"I will pray about it. I am in great trouble myself; we are\nall in great trouble.\"\n\"I know it, I know it. Oh! dear lady, ever since night and day, night\nand day, I have prayed for you, and that God would keep you.\"\nThere was something in the girl's despairing voice which touched Joyce\nto the heart.\n\"Come round to the kitchen door with me,\" she said, \"and I will see that\nyou have rest and food. I am sure you want both.\"\n\"I don't want rest; there is no rest in me, and food chokes me.\"\nBut Joyce took no notice of this, and saying, decidedly, \"follow me,\"\nshe put her hand on Piers' shoulder, and they went through the\nplantation to the house, skirting it to the left instead of crossing\nit, and so round to the stable-yard and the back premises.\nMrs. Falconer never had old maid servants; she trained girls to fill the\nplaces in her household, and of these, there was an endless stream\npassing through. The two in the kitchen now were both kindly,\ngood-tempered girls, utterly ignorant, but simple-hearted and honest.\n\"I want this poor young woman,\" Joyce said, \"to rest by the fire; and\ngive her her supper before she leaves. Sarah, do you hear me?\" Joyce\nsaid.\n\"Yes, miss, I hear,\" Sarah said, surveying the poor, forlorn girl with\nscorn. \"Yes, miss. I don't know whether missis would hold with taking in\na tramp like her.\"\n\"I am going to ask mother now,\" Joyce said; \"and I know you are\nkind-hearted, Sarah, and that you will attend to this poor girl, because\nI wish it.\"\nSarah gave a low sound, which was taken for consent; and Joyce, judging\nrightly that Susan Priday would be better left to the servants, went to\nfind her mother.\nAs she crossed the hall she met Ralph.\n\"There are letters from Italy,\" he said. \"Melville had not heard when he\nwrote.\"\n\"Where are the letters?\" Joyce asked.\n\"Mother has them. There is one for you--not from Italy though; it has\nthe Bristol post-mark, and is franked. There was an immense deal to pay\nfor Melville's.\"\nJoyce waited to hear no more, but went to her mother. She was sitting\nwith her son's letter open before her. It began, \"Dear father and\nmother,\" and these words went like a knife through Joyce's heart.\nMrs. Falconer sat day after day in the same chair by the fire-place. Her\nlarge widow's cap--in those days an immense erection of many thick\nfrillings, and with long \"weepers\" falling over her shoulders--altered\nher so entirely, scarcely any one would have recognised her.\nJoyce glanced through the letter. It was as self-sufficient and trifling\nas ever. Melville found foreign travel less delightful than he had\nexpected.\nThe diligence was then the universal mode of transit through France, and\nthe two travellers had taken a whole month to reach Hy\u00e8res, a journey\nwhich can now be got through in three days at the longest calculation.\nMelville complained of the food and the cramped diligence, and how the\nsmell of garlic made him sick; and how old Crawford was as \"stiff as\nstarch,\" and that he did not think he should stay away long.\nOf Genoa la Superba not a word, except to say that he had seen a fine\ncopy of one of Raphael's pictures for sale, which, if his father would\nsend the money, he would buy, for the dining hall at Fair Acres.\nJoyce had hardly patience to finish the letter; but her mother said:\n\"Give the letter to me, Joyce.\" And then she smoothed the thin sheet of\nforeign paper tenderly, and, refolding it, placed it in her large\nwork-box, which stood unused by her side.\nJoyce, meantime, opened the other letter, and a bright flush came over\nher face. She could not read it there; she put it into her deep pocket,\nand said:\n\"Dear mother, a poor girl is in the kitchen; she is utterly friendless\nand forlorn. May I let her sleep in the empty attic to-night, till I\nmake inquiries about her of the mistress of one of Mrs. More's schools\nto-morrow?\"\n\"You can do as you like, Joyce,\" was the reply, as poor Mrs. Falconer\nrelapsed into her usual condition of dreary silence, after kindling into\nsome interest about Melville's letter.\n\"You can do as you like--my day is over.\"\n\"Mother, dearest mother, do not say so; you will feel better soon. It\nis--it is the suddenness of the blow that has come upon you--and upon us\nall--that has stunned you. Do try to take comfort.\"\n\"Comfort, Joyce! You don't know what you are saying. I lived for your\nfather--and I have lost him. It was cruel, cruel to take him in his\nprime, to leave me desolate!\"\n\"You have got us children to love you, mother,\" Joyce ventured to say;\n\"and think how good Ralph is, giving up everything he cared for most, to\ntake up the business of the farm.\"\n\"As if he could do that,\" was the reply. \"Ralph is not fit for it.\"\n\"Mr. Watson says it is wonderful how he has fallen into the ways of\npeople on the estate. He has such a firm will and purpose in everything\nhe does.\"\nMrs. Falconer sighed.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I don't want to talk any more about it. I think if\nyou will get me the yarn I will go on knitting Harry's stockings.\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" Joyce said; \"and Piers will be so pleased to hold the skeins\nfor you, mother.\"\nThen she kissed her mother again and again, and whispered:\n\"You will come to church on Sunday, mother, won't you? It is so dull for\nyou, sitting here day after day.\"\n\"I can do nothing else,\" was the reply--\"nothing else. What else should\nI do? You are a dear, good child, Joyce. He always said so; he was\nalways right.\"\nThere is nothing harder to meet than a grief like poor Mrs. Falconer's;\nor rather, I should say, there is nothing harder to meet than a grief\nwhich refuses to recognise love in the midst of anguish which hardens\nand, as it were, paralyzes the whole being; changes the fountain of\nsweetness into bitterness; making the accustomed routine of duty\nimpossible and falling on the sufferer like a heavy pall.\n\"Missus is like somebody else; can't believe it is missus at all,\" the\nmaids said, when Joyce returned with the orders for poor Susan to remain\nall night, and to be cared for till the morning.\nThe poor girl was so utterly exhausted that she had fallen asleep, her\nface hidden on her arm, her elbows on the kitchen table; and her\nattitude of utter helplessness touched Joyce.\n\"Be kind to her,\" she said; \"she is very unhappy. Be kind to her, Sarah.\nI know you _will_ be kind to her as I wish it.\"",

But I remember your parting words, your kind\npromise not to forget me. Thus I venture to tell you that I bear\nyou ever in my mind, and that the time may come, _will_ come, when\nI shall beg you to hear more from me than I can say now, and grant\nme a very earnest petition. But not now would I speak of myself or\nof my hopes and fears. Rather would I tell you how I pray God to\ncomfort you for the loss of a father, whom I count it an honour to\nhave known. I would ask you to believe that I, who have had the\nprivilege of watching the happy home-life--now, alas! so sadly\nbroken up--can, at least, understand what the wreck must be. Please\npresent my regards and sympathy to Mrs. Falconer, and assure her\nof my remembrance of her kindness to me while her guest at Fair\nAcres, if indeed you think I may venture so far.\n\"I remain, dear Miss Falconer,\n\"Your very faithful and true\n\"GILBERT DECOURCY ARUNDEL.\"\nThere was a postscript written on the blank part of the sheet of Bath\npost, which was folded over.\n\"My mother is likely to visit the Palace, at Wells, in November. I\nhave charged her, if possible, to see you at Fair Acres. I have\nheard nothing from your brother, but I am well satisfied that he is\nout of England, for reasons which you know.--G. DeC. A.\"\nThe reserved style of this letter, so different from the random shots of\nthe present day, when young men and maidens seem to think the form of a\ntelegram the most appropriate way of expressing their thoughts, may\nprovoke a smile, and be pronounced priggish and formal. But in Joyce's\neyes it was a perfect letter, and she felt it to be a support and\ncomfort to her in her loneliness. Words which come from the heart seldom\nmiss their aim; and Joyce felt that, underlying those carefully written\nlines, there was the certainty that if her promise to him was\nfulfilled, and that she thought, even in her sorrow, of him continually,\n_he_, on his part, did not forget her.\nIn the simplicity of her young heart, she had never dreamed that Gilbert\ncould really care for her, and his long silence had made her think of\nhim only as of someone who had passed out of her life, and was to be in\nfuture but a memory. Now the fluttering hope became almost a certainty,\nand she repeated to herself many times that evening, as a bird repeats\nits song over and over with the same rapture of content--\n\"I bear you ever in my mind, and the time may come, _will_ come, when I\nwill beg you to hear more from me than I dare to say now, and grant me a\nvery earnest petition.\"\n\"The time _will_ come--the time _will_ come, and, meanwhile, I can",

The rabble were at this time\ncollected in East Wells, and the more respectable part of the spectators\nwere admitted here. The bell was chiming for service, and as Mr. Dacres\nambled across the grass, the Dean, preceded by his verger, was coming\nout of his gate to the cathedral. Unlike his predecessor, Dean Lukin,\nwho is reported to have made the bull-baiting a festal occasion at the\nDeanery, even inviting guests to be present at it, the Dean demurred a\nlittle at the bull passing under the Chain Gate at all, thus entering\nthe precincts of the cathedral.\n[Illustration: The Deanery Wells.]\n\"How do, Dacres, how do?\" the Dean said; \"the crowd is very orderly at\npresent.\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Dean, so far; the great proportion of people are in East\nWells. This young lady is a guest at the palace, and would like to see\nthe bull pass. Might I escort her and Lord--Lord Hawthorne to the\nterrace?\"\nThe Dean bowed rather stiffly. He would have thought better both of the\nyoung lady and her companion, if they had come to the service and joined\nin the thanksgiving for the happy deliverance of King James I. and the\nthree estates of England from the most traitorous and bloody-intended\nmassacre by gunpowder; and--looking on some years--as the inscription at\nthe head of the Form of Prayer also went on to say--\n\"For the happy arrival of His Majesty King William on this day, for the\ndeliverance of our church and nation.\"\n\"By all means, Mr. Dacres. I think in future I shall prohibit the\nprocession passing this way. It is scarcely seemly while service is\ngoing on within the cathedral walls.\"\nWith this the Dean passed on, and Gratian, laughing, said:\n\"The Dean is hardly as gracious as the Bishop. Let us stand here,\nbecause we shall get away sooner to the market-place after the bull has\npassed.\"\nMr. Dacres was rather glad to retrieve his character with the Dean, by\nhastening to the cathedral, after having placed Lord Maythorne and\nGratian, in a good place by the wall; and then, after some trial of\npatience, the sound of shouts and a brass band heralded the approach of\nthe bull.\nDecked with ribbons, and with his head well set forward, led by his\nkeepers by a ring passed through the nose, the bull stepped proudly on,\nfollowed by the dogs, all in charge of their respective owners.\nThere was always something pathetic in the sight of a huge animal\nbrought out, not to fight in a fair field, but to be worried almost to\ndeath by the onslaught of persistent dogs, all goaded on to make their\nattack, all backed by betting men, who had an interest in their success\nor failure.\nIn Pepys' celebrated 'Diary' there is a description of a bull-baiting to\nwhich he seems to have gone to divert his mind from the furious letter\nwhich a friend told him was on his way to him from Lord Peterborough,\nwhich letter seems to have preyed upon him more than the news recorded\non a previous page of three people in one house \"dead of the plague.\"\nThe bull-baiting, however, was pronounced, even by the sight-loving\nSamuel Pepys, as a \"very rude and very nasty pleasure.\"\nYet, more than a century and a half later, we find the usually quiet and\npeaceful city of Wells all agog to witness the bull-baiting in the\nmarket square.\nIt was as Lord Maythorne said; every window was engaged, and the\ntradespeople commanded high prices for the day.\nLadies in smart dresses, with gentlemen in attendance, were to be seen\nsitting at the old lattice bay windows, all along the line of houses in\nthe square.\nLord Maythorne had engaged places over the principal draper's shop,\nwhere Joyce and Charlotte had made their purchases, on the day of\nGilbert Arundel's arrival at Fair Acres.\nIt was with some difficulty that Lord Maythorne and Gratian made their\nway through the turnstile by Penniless Porch, and gained the door of the",

A party from the\npalace went forth about eight o'clock to see the illumination of the\nbonfire, gaining easy access to the offices of the Bishop's secretary,\nwhich were situated between the two gateways, one called Penniless\nPorch, the other the Palace Eye, both at the top of the market square.\nThose who had turned away with disgust from the bull-fight, yet felt it\nalmost their duty to be present at the great Protestant demonstration of\nfire and burning. So that the windows of the office were filled by the\npalace party, amongst whom were members of the Bishop's family.\n[Illustration: Penniless Porch, Wells.]\nIt was indeed a sight never to be forgotten when the huge bonfire was\nlighted, and the flames leaped up to the sky. The quaint old houses in\nthe market square were illuminated with a ruddy glow, and the cathedral\ntowers caught the fitful radiance, and stood up against the murky\nNovember sky with a flush of crimson on their hoary heads. The shouting\nand the tumult reached its height when Guy Fawkes' great effigy fell\ninto the burning mass, and cries of \"No Popery!\" \"Down with the\nCatholics!\" were taken up, by every little screaming urchin, who, with\nburned fingers and scorched cheeks, thought he was doing good service to\nsome cause, though, if he and half that seething crowd had been\nquestioned as to why they came together, the \"more part,\" as in times of\nold, could not have given an answer.\nA great wrong once done, which fastens on the mind of a nation, and is\nhanded down as a subject of everlasting indignation from generation to\ngeneration, must be expected to demand outward demonstration. Thus the\nfires of Smithfield, and the secret plot of the conspirators beneath the\nhall at Westminster, have never been forgotten.\nThe people still hunger for some expression of their wrath, and do not\nwait to ask if that expression takes a wholesome form.\nAlthough like demonstrations have been very much moderated of late\nyears, and nearly stopped altogether by the authorities in Wells, still\nthere is yet a city of the West whose motto is \"Ever faithful,\" where\nthe same scene is acted even on a larger scale; and woe to the unhappy\nman who may have incurred the displeasure of the good people of Exeter\nduring the current year. His effigy is still paraded through the\nstreets, followed by mummers in gay attire, and, amidst general\nexecrations, his image tumbles down into the fiery furnace, as a meet\ncompanion for that, of the never-to-be-forgotten Guy Fawkes.",

The sky was blue, the air soft and\nbalmy, and the sunshine lay upon the peaceful city, once more the City\nof Rest, which the good Bishop had called it when he first viewed the\nscene of his future labours as chief pastor of the diocese of Bath and\nWells.\nThe noise and tumult of the fifth of November seemed now like a troubled\ndream. Once more the only sounds which broke the silence were the chime\nof bells for service, the trickling of streams of water, the cawing of\nrooks in the elm trees by the moat, the chatter of the Jackdaws as they\nswung in and out of their nests on the cathedral towers. All within and\naround the Palace was calm and quiet.\nAnd in the market square every sign of the late uproar was removed, the\n_d\u00e9bris_ cleared away; the cry of a child, the foot-fall of a\npedestrian, or the low rumble of a distant cart, was heard with that\nwonderful distinctness which is born of surrounding stillness. Here and\nthere a word was exchanged with a customer by the master of a shop, who,\nstanding at the door, looked out upon the world with that quiet patient\nexpectation of custom, unknown in busy, populous towns.\nAs the Bishop's carriage drove through the market-place, several\nfigures appeared at the doors of the shops. The carriage was watched\nout of sight, the heads of the watchers were turned right and left, and\nthen the figures disappeared again, like those weather-wise men and\nwomen in the old-fashioned barometers now, like many other quaint\ndevices almost unknown.\nIf the day were fair and beautiful in Wells, it was doubly beautiful in\nthe country. Joyce felt its influence, and, for the first time since her\nfather's death, she sang gently to herself as she went about her\nhousehold duties.\nSince she had received Gilbert Arundel's letter, a ray of brightness had\npierced the cloud. She had not answered it, for he had asked for no\nanswer. And Joyce, in the sweet simplicity of her faith in him told\nherself, that she had given her promise not to forget him, and that in\nthat promise he was resting till the time came for him to ask her that\nquestion, which he said he must ask, and to present the petition which\nhe hoped she would grant.\nOf course she was ready to give him what he asked for, but there was to\nher nature, always trusting and transparent, no hardship in waiting.\n\"If I doubted him I could not wait so patiently,\" she thought, \"but I\n_trust_ him.\"",

I am Lord Maythorne; you will have heard of\nme?\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said, calmly; \"yes, I have heard of you.\"\n\"No good report, I will venture to affirm, guessing, as I do with some\ncertainty, from whom the report came. If you tell that little boy--lame,\nI see, poor fellow!--to leave us, I will briefly relate the\ncircumstances of my friendship with your brother. Come, Miss Falconer,\ndo not be unjust to me, but hear what I have to say. I prefer that our\nconversation should be private; it is of great importance that you\nshould hear what I have to say, _alone_.\"\nJoyce hesitated; that instinctive dread of men who are neither\nhonourable nor good, which all pure-minded maidens feel, made Joyce\nshrink back from the very touch of Lord Maythorne's hand, as he tried to\ntake hers, with a gesture of profound reverence and raise it to his\nlips.\n\"I little thought,\" he murmured, \"that I should find in Melville's\nsister any one so charming, and I confess that I am _boulevers\u00e9_ at\nonce. Nay, do not look so sternly at me.\"\n\"I do not know what right you have, my lord, to come here to alarm and\nannoy me. If the matter you have to tell me is important about\nMelville, I would refer you to my brother Ralph, and Mr. Paget, who is\nmy dear father's executor.\"\nPiers, who had been watching the whole scene, now came hastily forward.\n\"Ralph has gone into the Wells market, and Joyce has no one at home but\nme to take care of her. She does not wish you to stay, and you ought to\nsee that, and go away.\"\n\"You had better try the effect of one of your crutches on me, my boy! I\nam not going away, at present.\"\nPiers reddened, and was beginning an angry rejoinder, when Joyce said,\nin a low tone:\n\"Go and stand at the further end of the hall, Piers, and I will go into\nthe porch. If I want you I will call, but do not let mother know anyone\nis here. Now,\" she said, turning to Lord Maythorne, \"we will go into the\nporch, if you please, and you can tell me about Melville.\"\n\"Well,\" Lord Maythorne said. \"I had an interest in your brother, and I\nshould have pulled him through his troubles, if it had not been for the\nmeddling interference of a kinsman of mine, a young fellow--great in his\nown eyes--who cants like any old woman, and can turn up the whites of\nhis eyes with any Methodist in the land. He made a nice mess of it for\nyour brother owes me the money, and if he had left us alone we should\nhave arranged matters. As it was the whole story came out, your brother\nwas 'sent down' and those sharks the tradespeople, poured bills upon\nyour father's head.\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said, \"which my father, my dear father, paid. What does\nMelville owe you?\"\n\"A pretty round sum, but I would let it rest at five hundred pounds.\"\n\"Five hundred! Oh! it is impossible we could pay that. I will ask Mr.\nWatson and Mr. Paget----\"\n\"Pray do nothing of the sort,\" said Lord Maythorne, with lofty\nsuperiority; \"it is a mere trifle, but just now it happens to be a\nlittle inconvenient. The debts are such, as no _honourable_ man would\nleave unpaid. I promised Melville to keep them secret, and I have no\nwish to let the town crier go about with the news, but I naturally\njudged that on the death of his father, your brother would come into his\nfortune, and repay me.\"\n\"I do not think it is possible,\" Joyce said. \"My dear father had so many\nsons, and it was hard to provide for them. Please let me think about it,\nand give you an answer. I must consult Ralph, who is in charge here now,\ntill Melville comes home.\"\n\"Nay, I would ask as a great favour that you consult no one. If, when\nyour brother returns, you can come to any arrangement, let me know. I\nwould not wish to _press_ my claim unduly. I think you have seen my\nyoung nephew, Gilbert Arundel; he got a pitiable hold over your brother.\nIt is not the best taste to abuse one's own relations, so I will forbear\ngiving you Arundel's character _in extenso_; suffice it to say, he is a\nhypocrite. He has been playing fast and loose ever since he was a boy,\nwith a fair lady much older than himself; he fancies himself in love\nwith her, and she is so foolish as to believe it. The ten years which\nseparate them in age is a trifle in his eyes. She is handsome enough,\nand fascinating; knows the world and its ways, and, resents my good\nsister's pious exhortations, rather laughs at them, in fact. Am I\nspeaking in riddles? Arundel's mother is my step-sister; my father\ntaking it into his head to marry for the second time, when no one\nexpected him to do so. But it was a lucky thing for the world at large\nthat he did marry, for I am the result!\" The low satirical laugh had a\nring of bitterness in it, and the face that was really handsome, was\nclouded by a most disagreeable expression.\nIt was a hard ordeal for Joyce to be thus, as it were, in the hands of\na keen-witted man of the world, who, when he had finished his own story,\nbegan to pour out the most fulsome flattery, and to appear to take it\nfor granted that Joyce would be won by it. He little knew the strength\nand courage which the \"rustic beauty,\" as he inwardly called her, could\nshow.\nAs soon as she could get a word in, she rallied herself, and said, in a\nlow, determined voice:\n\"I do not wish to hear any more, my lord. I do not think you have any\nright to come here and offend me by saying what you cannot mean. I will\ntake advice about my brother's debts to you, and, if you please, I will\nlet you know the result.\"\n\"What a charming woman of business!\" exclaimed Lord Maythorne. \"A\nveritable Portia. A little indignant protest is so becoming. Well, well,\nwe will leave the matter for the present.\"\nAnd now a figure, clothed in deepest mourning, appeared from the hall\nbehind, and Mrs. Falconer with a curtsey which was profoundly\nrespectful, said:\n\"May I ask, sir, what brings you to the house of a poor widow? My\ndaughter is very young and very inexperienced; I cannot allow you to\nremain to annoy her.\"\n\"My good lady, I am your daughter's slave. I am ready to lie at her\nfeet. Annoy her, forsooth!\"\nJoyce, who had endured bravely up to this moment, sprang towards her\nmother as if instinctively for protection, and Mrs. Falconer took her\nhand in hers.\n\"What is it, my dear, what is it? Piers came to call me; I thought you\nwere distressed.\"\nThis was really the first time since her sorrow that Mrs. Falconer had\nroused herself to take an interest in anything; but Piers' summons, with\nthe announcement that there was a man in the porch talking to Joyce, and\nthat he knew by the sound of her voice she was frightened, had not been\nin vain. The maternal love, deep in Mrs. Falconer's heart, asserted\nitself, and put to flight for the time the selfish brooding over her\nsorrow, in which for so many weeks she had indulged.\n\"Joyce is very young,\" she said, tenderly, \"and she has been left to\nbear a burden too heavy for her years. I beg you, sir, to say no more to\nhurt her and annoy her, but to leave the premises.\"\n\"My dear madam,\" Lord Maythorne said, \"I came in a friendly spirit to\ndiscuss a little business about your elder and very hopeful son. He owes\nme some eight hundred pounds--a debt of honour, but at the same time a\ndebt;\" and, setting his teeth, \"_One I mean to have paid!_ It may seem a\ntrifle to the owner of these broad acres, and to the inhabitants of this\ngrand ancestral home, but to me it happens to be no trifle. Good\nmorning.\"\nLord Maythorne turned away, raising his hat to Joyce, and saying:\n\"_Adieu, mia bella! adieu!_ but _au revoir! au revoir!_\"\nMrs. Falconer pressed Joyce, trembling and frightened to her side,\nsaying, in a low voice:\n\"What does he mean? Who is he?\"\n\"He means that Melville has lost money to him by gambling; I think he is\nLord Maythorne.\"",

Is Mrs. Falconer at home?\"\nAnd now Joyce advanced out of the shadow, and stood under the roses by\nthe porch.\nThe late encounter with Lord Maythorne had heightened her colour, and\ntears were still upon her long lashes--the tears of vexation she had\ntried so hard to keep back.\nOne glance, and Mrs. Arundel felt sure she saw before her her son's\n\"Joyce, Sunshine, Birdie! for they call her all those names,\" he had\nsaid.\nShe looked just now, with her head drooping, and the traces of tears on\nher cheeks, very like one of the China roses above her, hanging its head\nafter a shower.\nGratian also examined her critically.\nShe is _beautiful_, she thought, but she has no style; while the Bishop\nleaned forward, and asked:\n\"May we alight?\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Joyce said, in a low, gentle voice. \"My mother has seen\nno visitors for a long time; but she will be pleased to see you, and--\"\n\"Mrs. Arundel, I hope, also, and Miss Gratian Anson,\" the Bishop said,\nby way of introduction, \"Madam,\" he continued, as he went into the hall,\n\"Madam, I have heard of your good husband; I had once the pleasure--I\nmay say the honour--of seeing him at the palace, and I desire to express\nto you my condolences. My son,\" he added, addressing a young gentleman\nin clerical dress, who was as much like his father as youth can resemble\nage, \"my son is also anxious to pay his respects. My wife, Mrs. Law, is\nyet absent on account of her health, but returns to the palace next\nweek.\"\nBoth the Bishop and his son were courtly gentlemen of what we call now\n\"the old school,\" and they had peculiarly clear and sonorous voices; the\nold man's set in rather a lower key than his son's.\n\"Pray, my lord,\" Mrs. Falconer said, \"walk in, and I beg you to excuse a\ndesolate sitting room,\" opening a door to the right of the hall; \"I have\nnever had courage to sit here since--since our trouble. Joyce draw up\nthe blinds and set the chairs.\" Mrs. Falconer said this, with something\nof her old quickness.\n\"Our little parlour would be warmer, mother; this room feels cold,\"\nJoyce said, in a low tone, as she obeyed her mother, and noticed the\ncold, damp, unused atmosphere, which always clings to a room that has\nbeen closed for some time.\nThat room, with its three windows set in thick frames, with deep\nwindow-seats beneath, had been Mrs. Falconer's pride. As she looked\nround now, the furniture seemed dull, and the whole aspect of things\nchanged.\n\"Yes,\" she said, sadly, \"yes, you are right, Joyce; this room is not fit\nto sit down in; we will go to our own sitting room, if his lordship will\nfollow me.\"\nThe whole party adjourned there, and Piers, with unusual forethought,\nhad already ordered a tray to be brought in; for it was always _en\nr\u00e8gle_ in country houses in those days to offer refreshment of wine and\ncake, as calls were paid early, just as afternoon tea is brought in now\nfor visitors later in the day.\nMrs. Arundel left the Bishop to talk to Mrs. Falconer, and Gratian won\nPiers' heart by professing the deepest interest in his drawer full of\nbirds' eggs, which happened to be opened. That was one of Gratian's\nstrongest weapons; she took, or appeared to take, an interest in\neverybody's particular hobby, and yet she was listening with one ear to\nevery word that passed between Mrs. Arundel and Joyce. Poor Piers was\nquite unconscious that he had not her whole attention. When Mr. Law\njoined the discussion she withdrew and said to Joyce, \"I should like to\nsee the grounds, would you show me round.\" Piers wondered at her abrupt\ndeparture from the contemplation of the wren's eggs, and his animated\nstory of the way the little wrens huddle together in a nest in the\nwinter, under ground, in a hedge facing south, and come out to try the\nair in the first warm days in February, retiring again if it is too cold\nfor them.\nJoyce led the way, thankful to see how much more her mother looked like\nherself, as she told to the sympathetic ear of the Bishop the story of\nher grief.\nGratian took pains to suit herself to her company; she always did. She\nlinked her arm through Joyce's, and talked in a low voice, instead of\nher wonted high pitched rattle. She told her how grieved she felt for\nher; she could easily imagine what such a sorrow must be; for she, a\n\"poor orphan\" herself, could indeed sympathise with her.\nSo she talked, as they paced the gravel walk under the sunny south wall\nof the old-fashioned garden, where the arms of a huge pear-tree were\nstill heavily laden with brown fruit, and where bushes of pale lilac,\nMichaelmas daisies, and lavender, still attracted a number of late bees\nand errant wasps, who, like all the rest of the world, found it hard to\nbelieve that this was the November sunshine of a short winter's day, and\nnot the long drawn out heat of July.\n\"I should like to know more of you; to see more,\" Gratian was saying.\n\"Of course, I expected you were charming from what Gilbert told me.\nGilbert and I are _great_ friends; he tells me everything.\"\nA scarcely perceptible recoil, in the little figure by her side, was not\nlost on Gratian.\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"he is a dear boy--a little spoiled by the notions he\nhas taken up lately; but they are spreading everywhere. The Cambridge\nmen are even worse than the Oxford men. However, I won't quarrel with\nGilbert about that, and I can take a little preachment from him. Aunt\nBella is pleased with anything Gilbert says or does; and as to\nMaythorne----\"\nJoyce started, very visibly this time, at that name, and said,\nwithdrawing her hand from her companion's arm, and stooping to gather\nsome sprigs of lavender:\n\"I suppose Lord Maythorne is a relation of yours?\"\n\"Distant; very distant,\" was the reply. \"A connection is nearer the\ntruth.\"\n\"Because,\" Joyce said, \"I think he is a very bad and wicked man, and I\nwish you could tell him never to come here again.\"\n\"Come here! Has he been here,\" Gratian exclaimed. \"What on earth did he\ncome here for?\"\n\"He had not been gone half-an-hour before the Bishop's carriage drove\nup. He has, as you know, done my eldest brother a great deal of\nmischief; and, though my dear father thought he had cleared all his\ndebts, this Lord Maythorne says that he still owes him a great deal, and\nwe cannot pay it.\"\n\"And is that what he came to say; very kind and pleasant of him, I must\nconfess. I expect he said a great deal more.\"\nJoyce blushed scarlet.\n\"He was very impertinent,\" she said, \"and talked in a very free way to\nme, but it is over now, and I wish to forget it. Only, if you can, will\nyou prevent him from coming again; or as he is Mrs. Arundel's brother,\ncould you ask _her_ to prevent him. When I have consulted Mr. Paget,\ndear father's executor and our trustee, I will try if any of the money\ncan be paid.\"\n\"Don't think of paying a farthing,\" Gratian said, \"pray; I will see what\nI can do in the matter. I will talk to Gilbert. Gilbert is certain to do\nwhat I ask him, and I know how much he cared about your brother. Yes,\nyou may depend upon my doing my best, you darling!\" Gratian said,\nstooping down and kissing Joyce's rounded cheek.\nJoyce made no response, as Gratian expected, and then they walked\nsilently to the house.\nAs they drove towards Wells, Gratian, after a pause suddenly said:\n\"Aunt Bella, Maythorne is still in this neighbourhood. He has been at\nFair Acres to-day.\"\n\"Maythorne!\" Mrs. Arundel exclaimed. Then to herself, but not aloud, she\nsaid:\n\"I must let Gilbert know at once.\"\n[Illustration]",

She had taken little or no notice of Susan's\npresence in the kitchen and dairy till she began to come forth from her\nseclusion.

Farming and gardening operations were suspended, and Ralph got\nout his beloved books again, and Piers arranged and re-arranged his\nlarge collection of curiosities, and Christmas drew near.\nJoyce had given up listening for a footstep on the road, or looking\nanxiously for the old postman, who trudged from Wells, on fine days,\nwith the letters, but in bad weather pleased himself as to the length of\nhis rounds.\nMrs. Falconer worked, and knitted, and darned, and, when the wind blew\nfiercely round the house on the dark winter nights, thought of her\nlittle Middies tossing about on the wide sea; and of Melville in that\nfar-off land, which she knew more by its shape of a boot on the map\nPiers had hung up in his room, than by any distinct notion of what was\nto be seen there.\nRome, Florence, Naples, were but names to her, and as dim and distant as\nHaiphong or Hong Kong are to many in the present day.\n'Melville was in Italy,' and her interest in the country was expressed\nin these words. Melville's letter, written on hearing of his father's\ndeath, was sad enough. Weak natures like his, always find relief in\ntrouble by many words, and give vent to grief by vain protestations of\naffection and of remorse.\nMrs. Falconer treasured the letter, and read it many times, and thought\nJoyce unfeeling in expressing so little sympathy with her brother. There\ncould be no doubt that all his wilful disregard of his father's wishes\nstarted up before Melville, now that it was too late to atone for them,\nand for the time, as he said, \"he was distracted with grief.\" But there\nwas no word of a desire to redeem the past by coming to Fair Acres and\ndoing his best to perform his duties there. Selfish people are not cured\nby trouble of their selfishness. It commonly happens that they are more\nselfish in their grief than in their joy, more self-absorbed by pain\nthan pleasure.\nWhile Melville could write of his distracted condition, of his love for\nhis father, of his burning indignation against the wretch who had caused\nhis death, and of his determination to have him brought to justice,\nJoyce was silent; only sometimes, when kneeling by Piers' bed, would she\nallow her grief full vent; only when alone in the seat under the fir\ntrees would she cry out in the bitterness of her heart for the lost\nfather who had been so dear to her.",

            "text": "Miss Falconer was really pleased that Joyce should propose a visit, and\nthe little guest-chamber in the Vicar's Close was made ready with\nwilling hands, and Charlotte hailed Joyce's appearance, that she might\ntell her of all her hopes and fears.\nCharlotte had been twice at the Palace during the winter. Mrs. Law,\ngentle and kindly, had taken an interest in the young people in Wells,\nand had invited Charlotte, amongst others, to tea. Tea at six o'clock,\non some day when the bishop and his chaplain and Mr. Henry Law, were\nabsent on some business in the diocese.\nIf it had been a great thing to visit Mrs. Hannah More at Barley Wood,\nit was a greater to take tea at the palace. With the wigs of the last\nand preceding century, the bishops have thrown off a great deal of the\nepiscopal state, which was once considered a part of the duty of the\npeer spiritual. And a certain air of solemnity pervaded the Wells\npalace, even when presided over by such true \"gentlefolks\" as the\nbishop and Mrs. Law. That old-fashioned word seems to suit the host and\nhostess at the Wells palace far better than any other term I could use.\nThat innate grace and refinement of feeling is sometimes, it is true,\nacquired, but it is a plant of slow growth, especially amongst those,\nwho suddenly raised to a position of importance in the Church, feel the\nelevation makes them a little dizzy. The Bishop's wife, then presiding\nover the palace, had always moved in the higher circles of society, and,\ntherefore, neither at Carlisle nor Wells did she find it necessary to\nimpress upon humbler people that she stood on a vantage ground to which\nfew could approach. She was dignified, though she was gentle, and no one\nwould ever pass the barrier which divides familiarity, from free and\npleasant intercourse. Mrs. Law, like everyone else, was greatly taken\nwith Joyce Falconer; and again poor Charlotte began to feel that with no\neffort at all her cousin was winning her way, and making an impression\nwhich, with all her efforts, she felt she did not succeed in doing.\nMiss Falconer was surprised when, the day after the girls had spent an\nevening at the palace, Mrs. Law sent a little three-cornered note of\ninvitation to Joyce to spend Sunday at the palace before she returned\nto Fair Acres. The footman waited for a reply, and the discussion of\nMrs. Law's note caused no little excitement in the parlour, of which the\nservant, if he had been so minded, could have heard every word.\n\"My dear Joyce, what will you do? You have no suitable dress for such a\nvisit; and yet it is a pity to miss it. I really do not know what to\nadvise.\"\n\"I think I should like to go to the palace, Aunt Letitia,\" Joyce said.\n\"Like! yes; but are you prepared for such a visit?\"\n\"Oh! yes; I have my best frock, the black bombazine, and my crape\nbonnet. That need not hinder me.\"\n\"But, my dear, people in Mrs. Law's position wear evening gowns, with\nlow necks and short sleeves. _I_ have moved in these circles, and of\ncourse----\"\n\"We must not keep the servant waiting, Aunt Letitia; if you give me\nleave, I should like to accept the invitation.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Miss Falconer; \"there is my writing-case; take care\nhow you write; begin, 'Miss Joyce Falconer presents her respects.'\"\n\"But Mrs. Law addresses me as, 'Dear Miss Falconer'; had I not better\nbegin, 'Dear Madam, or dear Mrs. Law'?\"\n\"Oh! _not_ 'Dear Mrs. Law.' My dear child, how ignorant you are of\netiquette.\"\nJoyce seated herself, and wrote a few words accepting the invitation\nfrom Saturday to the Monday following, and took it herself to the\nfootman.\n\"You should have rung for Phoebe, really Joyce, my _dear_!\" But it was\ntoo late. Charlotte, who had been \"composing\" in the sitting-room\nupstairs, had heard voices, and now came down just as Joyce had closed\nthe door on the footman from the palace.\n\"An invitation to _stay_ at the palace! Oh! Joyce, how fortunate you\nare. Mrs. Law might have asked me!\"\n\"She knows you live in the place, my love,\" said Miss Falconer.\nCharlotte sighed. \"If I did _not_ live here it would be all the same.\"\nBut Charlotte was really an amiable girl, and her devotion to Joyce was\nsincere and true.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"what will you wear, dear? Can I lend you any pretty\nthings? My amber beads--or--my filigree comb. Oh! I forgot! Of course,\nyou are still in deep black.\"\n\"It is very kind of you, Charlotte,\" Joyce said; \"you always are kind;\nbut I don't want anything.\"\nThe whole of that day Joyce's visit to the palace engrossed the little\nparty in the Vicar's Close. Some cronies of Miss Falconer came in for a\ngossip by the fireside, and were duly informed of the invitation, and\nwere duly congratulatory and a little jealous, although there was a\ncertain amount of satisfaction, that it was not Charlotte whom Mrs. Law\nhad delighted to honour.",

            "text": "It was a memorable visit to Joyce, and in a way she little expected. The\nfirst evening passed pleasantly; and with a white muslin fichu, which\nMiss Falconer insisted upon making for her, crossed over her black gown,\nJoyce looked her best. The sleeves of best gowns in those days were cut\nrather short, and Joyce wore on her round, white arms a pair of black\nlace mittens, which Charlotte had lent her.\nHer beautiful hair needed no adornment; it fell round her forehead in\nnatural curls, and was piled up without the help of cushions or\nfrizzettes, a natural crown of chesnut and gold. As at Barley Wood, so\nat the palace; Joyce was too simple-minded to be stiff or constrained in\nmanner, and she conversed so pleasantly with a young son of the bishop,\nwho gave her his arm when they went to dinner, that he, in his turn, did\nhis best to be agreeable, and she was soon telling him of her little\nsailor brothers, of Piers and his collection of butterflies, of Ralph\nand his love of study, and the brave way in which he had come to live\nat Fair Acres and do his best to turn into a farmer.\nIf the Saturday evenings were pleasant, how delightful was the Sunday,\nwhen, in the sunshine of the early February day, the party from the\npalace crossed to the cloister door, and went to the morning service in\nthe cathedral. It has been said of Wells that it is always Sunday there;\nno sounds but the ringing of bells for service; no business, and no\ntraffic in the streets. But certain it is, that nowhere is the real\nSabbath stillness more profound, nor more refreshing to the tired in\nspirit, on a day like that February day, when Joyce was seated in the\nhigh pew belonging to the Bishop. The cathedral is always a vision of\nbeauty, and when the swelling of the organ and the voices of the\nchoristers are hushed, and a pause occurs after the benediction has been\npronounced, the sounds without the building seem in direct harmony with\nthose within; for the Lady Chapel abuts on the lawn of the Sub-Dean's\nresidence, where the waters of St. Joseph's Well lie deep; and there is\nthe murmur of the streams, the chirp of birds, the soft coo of pigeons,\nand the distinct chatter of the jackdaw from the West front.\nJoyce went out of the cathedral filled with peaceful thoughts of the\ntemple, of which this was but the faint shadow, the temple which has no\nneed of the sun to lighten it, for the Lamb is the light thereof.\nQuite forgetting that she ought to turn towards the cloisters, Joyce\nwalked on down the nave before the Bishop's party had missed her. The\nsweet seriousness of her face as she went out into the sunshine almost\nheld back the welcome, which was trembling on the lips of someone who\nwas standing near the porch, and had watched her coming down the wide\nnave.\nShe was passing out, wrapt in her own meditations when Gilbert Arundel\nput out his hand:\n\"Joyce!\"\nShe started, and blushed rosy red.\n\"You did forget me, then!\" he exclaimed, reproachfully.\n\"Forget you, no.\"\n\"You did not reply to my letter?\"\n\"You did not ask me to write.\"\nThey now found themselves by the turnstile under the old clock, that\nquaint clock which, it is said, was made to strike many times in\nsuccession for the amusement of that gracious and sagacious King James,\nwho laughed till his sides ached, as the old knights, in their black\narmour, hit the bell with their battle-axes, beneath the suggestive\nmotto, \"Ne quid pereat.\" They hit it now with, all their wonted vigour\nfour times, and then the clock struck _one_.\n[Illustration: Clock at Wells]\n\"We have come the wrong way. I am staying at the palace till to-morrow,\"\nJoyce said.\n\"At the palace! I am glad to hear it; but your mother, whom I saw\nyesterday, did not know it.\"\n\"No; it was a sudden thought. I mean Mrs. Law only asked me on Friday.\"\n\"I am glad you are at the palace,\" Gilbert said. \"I know I shall have a\nfriend in the Bishop.\"\nJoyce made no remark to this, and they retraced their steps in silence\ntill they had crossed the drawbridge and were in the palace grounds.\n\"I have thought so much of you,\" he said, earnestly. \"I am now come, as\nI said I should, to present my petition. Is there any hope?\"\nJoyce turned away her head, and did not answer.\nWhen they reached the palace, a footman threw open the door:\n\"Dinner is served,\" he said, in a voice which was intended to be a mild\nreproof.\n\"Can I see his lordship?\" Gilbert asked; while Joyce ran upstairs to her\nroom on the upper floor.\n\"His lordship is just sitting down to dinner, sir. What name----\"\nGilbert took out a card and handed it to the man, leaving him in the\nhall till he knew the Bishop's will.\nPresently he reappeared.\n\"I am requested to beg you, sir, to go into the dining-room at once:\nthis way.\"\nThe Bishop rose, and gave Gilbert Arundel a very different greeting\nfrom that which he had granted Lord Maythorne.\n\"My dear young friend, welcome for your _mother's_ sake, always welcome,\nand for your own. How could you doubt it? Why stand on ceremony? But we\nare in some distress,\" he said, with a sly twinkle in his eye; \"we have\nlost a young lady: she vanished into thin air as we left the cathedral.\nPerhaps some knight-errant has carried her off. Ah! I see you know\nsomething about her. Well, sit down; and, Barker,\" to one of the\nservants, \"Miss Falconer's place next Mr. Arundel's.\"\nThe Bishop dearly loved a little love affair, and he fancied he descried\none in \"the air.\"\nIt was a great trial of Joyce's self-possession when the door of the\ndining-room was opened for her by a servant, and she had to pass to her\nplace at the long dining-table. The Bishop's son came to the rescue,\nmaking room for her by standing up and showing her the vacant place.\n\"I am sorry I was late,\" she said.\n\"It is a lovely day,\" was the rejoinder. \"I do not wonder that you took\na turn after service.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Law, kindly. \"I saw your cousin in the cathedral, and I\nthought it probable that you would walk home with her.\"\n\"No,\" Joyce said, in a low voice, \"I did not go home with Charlotte.\"\nOne person at least appreciated the honesty of this confession, and\nGilbert told himself that it was a part of Joyce's crystal transparency\nof character, that she would not even allow an assertion about herself\nto pass if it were not absolutely true.\nWhen Joyce was sitting after dinner, with Mrs. Law and several ladies,\nin the long gallery, the Bishop's son brought her a message.\n\"My father would like to see you in his study for a few minutes. Will\nyou kindly follow me?\"\nJoyce obeyed, but her heart beat fast, and she dreaded what the Bishop\nmight have to say to her. Something about Melville; some bad news of the\nlittle Middies: her thoughts flew in all directions.\nThe Bishop had already seated himself in his crimson leather chair, and,\nwhen Mr. Law closed the door, she found herself alone with his lordship.\n\"My dear young lady,\" he said, in his slow, sonorous tones, \"as I know\nyou are, alas! fatherless, will you allow me to stand, for the moment,\nin the place of a father? A young gentleman, the son of an old friend,\nhas told me to-day that he seeks the honour of paying his addresses to\nyou. He went to Fair Acres last night and received your mother's\nsanction, tempered, no doubt, with the natural pain of losing you. But\nshe gives her consent, and I venture to endorse it. As chief pastor and\nfather of the diocese, over which I have so recently come to preside, I\ndo earnestly commend to you the son of my old friend, Gilbert Arundel. I\npropose that you should take a ramble together after service, in the\nspring twilight, and when we meet at the evening meal, I hope I may find\nyou have made my young friend happy.\"\nThe Bishop's speech may sound to us unnecessarily long and formal, but,\nsixty years ago, the old spirit of chivalrous respect towards maidens,\nin approaching the subject of marriage, had not then died out. Perhaps,\nalso, in the time of the good Bishop, when the first gentleman in Europe\nwas setting so wretched an example in his behaviour, good and honourable\nmen felt it the more incumbent on them to give the woman the full\nprivileges of her position.\nLove was to be sought as a favour granted, not claimed in a careless\nfashion as a right; while the whole aspect of courtship and marriage was\ndealt with more seriously than it is in our day.\nBarriers are more easily broken down than set up again, and, perhaps,\nthere is too great a tendency now-a-days to treat what is grave as a\njest, and to show but little inclination to tread in the paths which\nour mothers and grandmothers found safe. Thus the Bishop, when he had\nheard from Gilbert's lips the object of his visit to Wells, thought it\nhis duty to speak to Joyce in the grave manner I have described.\nThe Bishop rose from his chair, and, laying his hand on Joyce's head,\nsolemnly pronounced a blessing, and, with crimson cheek and bowed head,\nshe left him, to prepare to go to the afternoon service.",

It was a time and place for the exchange of first young\nlove, and confidences never to be forgotten.\nAnd in all the changes and chances of her future life, Joyce could look\nback to that first spring afternoon, and say from her heart that it was\nthe opening for her of a new and beautiful chapter. If the hopes of the\nearlier days of their acquaintance had lain dormant during the winter,\nthey now sprang up with the coming life of the spring time, and were\nsweet with the promise of the future.\nWhen once Gilbert had found voice to tell his story he was eloquent, and\nwhen once Joyce had given her response there was no further need for\nreticence.\n\"And why did you not write to me?\" he asked.\n\"As I said, because you did not ask me; and then when your uncle came,\nhe told me that you cared for Miss Anson; and I thought, _half_ thought,\nit might be true.\"\nGilbert made an impatient gesture.\n\"You only _half_ thought so; you knew, Joyce, you knew better. So,\" he\nwent on under his breath, \"that is the mischief he went to Fair Acres to\nwork. My mother soon stopped him from daring to persecute you.\"\n\"Mr. Paget and Mr. Gill said there was no lawful claim on poor Melville,\nfor the money had been lent him to gamble with, and that Lord Maythorne\nknew he had no just claim to it.\"\n\"Of course he knew it; he thought he would frighten you, and your poor\nmother. But let us not speak more of him.\"\n\"I wonder what will be done when Melville comes home, for I suppose he\nwill come home in the summer.\"\n\"Yes; perhaps he may have turned over a new leaf, as the children say;\nanyhow, I can't help being grateful to Melville.\"\n\"To Melville?\" she said.\n\"Yes; for was it not he who invited me to Fair Acres, to find _you_, my\ndarling.\"\nThen he drew her closer, and with her hand in his arm, they walked\nthrough the quiet fields back to the little city.\nThe cathedral stood up in a dark mysterious mass against the clear sky.\nThe last purple gleam was dying from the distant hills which encircle\nWells; Venus hung her silver lamp over the central tower of the\ncathedral, and the whole scene was one of infinite peace.\nThey did not speak of the future, the present was sufficient for them;\nbut the cry of Joyce's heart, even in its happiness, found words:\n\"Oh! that my father knew.\"\n\"He may know, my darling,\" Gilbert said; \"and I think we may rest in the\ncertainty that if he were here he would give me a welcome.\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said, softly; \"yes, I know he would.

            "text": "ON THE ROAD TO BRISTOL.\nA carriage stood before the door of Fair Acres one bright morning in\nApril, an old-fashioned travelling carriage, with a \"dickey,\" or back\nseat piled with luggage, and more packages waiting to be pushed under\nthe seat inside, which a lady was superintending and remonstrating with\na young sailor for his rough and ready help.\n\"Take care, take care, Harry; there is glass in that hamper. Oh! we must\nhave the carriage closed after all.\"\n\"Nonsense, Joyce; I'll manage it. There, let that bag go into the hold,\nand heave over the box. I'll cram them all in.\"\n\"The captain is right, miss--beg your pardon, missus, I should\nsay\"--said old Thomas, wiping his head vigorously with his pocket\nhandkerchief.\n\"Very well; now we are all ready. I hope mother is coming. Gently,\nFalcon, gently; don't pull dear old Duke so roughly.\"\n\"I want to take Duke to Bristol, mother; Grannie has left Fair Acres,\nand she is old; why shouldn't Duke?\"\n\"Duke would not be happy in Great George Street; would you, dear Duke?\"\nJoyce bent down to the grizzled head of the friend of so many years, and\nsaid:\n\"Ah! Duke, we are all getting old.\"\nPresently more voices were heard in the hall, and Mrs. Falconer appeared\nwith a little grand-daughter on either side, while Susan Priday brought\nup the procession with the baby in her arms.\n\"Now, dear mother, I think we are all ready. Have you enough wraps?\nWhere are Melville and Gratian and Piers?\"\n\"Melville is not dressed,\" said Piers, coming forward, \"and Gratian has\njust had her cup of chocolate taken her in bed.\"\n\"I must run and say Good-bye to her,\" exclaimed Joyce. \"What a pity to\nlie in bed on this lovely morning!\"\nJoyce tripped upstairs and tapped at the door of the room which had been\nher mother's in years past.\nTo the amazement of all the world, Gratian Anson had signified to\nMelville Falconer that she was ready to be mistress of Fair Acres, and\ninclude him in the bargain. On the whole the plan had answered fairly\nwell; but Mrs. Falconer had found the new _r\u00e9gime_ a perpetual vexation,\nand three years before this time had, by her son-in-law's advice,\nretired to a little cottage on Clifton Down with Piers, within reach of\nthe great joy and comfort of her declining years--Joyce and her husband\nand children.\nGratian kept Melville in good order. There were rumours in the\nneighbourhood that she took charge of the purse, and that an allowance\nwas doled out to her lord and master, which she never permitted him to\nexceed. However that might be, Gratian certainly managed to get through\nwithout heavy debts, and the squire's will had provided for the\nmaintenance of his widow, and the boys had each their portion paid from\nthe estate.\nMr. Watson and Ralph virtually managed the farm, and Ralph held a good\nposition and was greatly respected. Only one of the twins was left. The\nsea rolled over the bright hair of Bunny, on his second voyage. He was\nwashed from the mast by a huge wave, off the coast of Africa, and\nengulfed in the stormy waters, never to rise again. This sorrow had told\ngreatly on Mrs. Falconer, and she had aged very much since we saw her\nlast. But she was touchingly gentle and tender to Joyce, and her\nchildren were the delight of her heart.\nJoyce's tap was answered by a sleepy \"Come in.\"\n\"We are just starting, Gratian,\" Joyce said; \"I could not go without\nbidding you good-bye, and thanking you for a very pleasant visit.\"\n\"What makes you start so early?\"\n\"Gilbert wished us to be off by ten o'clock. He says Bristol is likely\nto be in a ferment to-day, and he did not wish us to be late.\"\n\"Late! Well I should think twelve would have been time enough to start.\nBid mother and Piers good-bye for me. Is Melville down stairs?\"\n\"I have not seen him,\" Joyce said; \"but perhaps he is in the study.\"\n\"Good-bye again,\" Joyce said, stooping to kiss Gratian; \"we have had a\nvery happy fortnight. I do like my children to know the dear old place.\"\n\"We are very glad to have you,\" Gratian replied; \"and, Joyce, if you pay\na visit at any of the best houses at Clifton, or near Bristol, notice if\nthe curtains are flowered damask or watered, for new curtains we _must_\nhave in the dining room.\"\nAnother yawn, and \"Good-bye, love to Aunt Annabella,\" and Gratian's\nhead, in the many-frilled night-cap, which scarcely hid a row of\ncurl-papers, fell back upon the pillow.\nAnd now Falcon's voice was heard.\n\"Mother, _do_ come; why doesn't Aunt Gratian get up? mother! How lazy\nshe is!\"\n\"Hush! Falcon,\" for Joyce saw her brother issuing forth from his\ndressing-room in a magnificent loose dressing-gown, and a scarlet fez\nwith a tassel on his head.\n\"Why! Joyce, off already?\" he said; \"I must come down and see the last\nof the infants. Thank goodness they are not mine!\"\n\"I have been to bid Gratian good-bye, and thanked her for her kindness;\nwe are a large party.\"\n\"Oh! so much the better,\" said Melville, good-temperedly; \"we are very\nglad to have you. What a regular family coach! Where did that come\nfrom?\"\n\"From the 'Swan.' Ralph ordered it yesterday.\"\nAt last they were all packed in.\nJoyce was the last, and she was just about to step into the carriage\nwhen Mr. Paget came riding up.\n\"Oh! you are off, Mrs. Arundel. I just called to tell you that there is\nnews of disturbances in Bristol. A great mob collected in Queen's Square\nlast night, and political feeling is exciting the people to madness. I\nsuppose Arundel will ride out to meet you?\"\n\"He told me to start early, that we might get through Bristol before the\nafternoon.\"\n\"Ah! Well, I daresay it will be all right. Upon my word, what a pretty\nparty you are! A rose and her rosebuds--eh! Mrs. Falconer? Where is\nRalph?\"\n\"Gone early to Bridgwater; there is a cattle sale to-day, and he and Mr.\nWatson went off at six o'clock.\"\n\"Ralph does not let the grass grow under his feet,--eh! Falconer? It is\nthe early bird that finds the worm.\"\nMelville smiled. The gorgeous colours of his dressing gown and fez came\nout in grand relief against the old porch, and Mr. Paget thought to\nhimself, how odd it was that Mr. Falconer's son should be so entirely\nunlike either father or mother. He had dismounted; while old Thomas held\nthe horse, he had helped Joyce into the carriage, and patted the rounded\ncheeks of the baby, whom her mother now took from her grandmother, and\nsettled comfortably on her knee, while he called out to Falcon, who was\nin the dickey with Susan and the luggage, not to put out his eyes with a\nlong cane he was brandishing, kicking his feet vigorously all the time,\nand shouting \"Gee up!\" at the pitch of his young lungs. The two little\nrosebuds of girls sat demure and quiet on the back seat with their uncle\nPiers; and then, with a final \"Good-bye\" and waving his hands, the\nscarlet-coated post-boy cracked his whip, and Joyce and her children\nwere fairly off for home; for, sweet as the old home was, and full of\ntender memories, the large city house in Great George Street was dearer",

Some stared at the carriage\nas they passed, some hissed, and angry voices cried:\n\"No Popery!\" and \"Reform!\"\nWhen within some four miles of the city, Susan Priday leaned over and\nsaid:\n\"There is a great crowd coming on behind us, ma'am; they look a very\nrough lot.\"\nThe carriage was going up a steep hill, and just as it had slowly\nreached the top, some fifty or sixty men came out from a lane, which\nturned off towards Bath, and called out to the post-boy to stop.\nThey were fierce, wild-looking men, and, as the post-boy tried to take\nno notice and whip on his horses, the bridles were seized and the\ncarriage was surrounded.\nThen a number of voices shouted--\n\"Reform! Reform! Are ye for Reform? you grand folks; if ye are, speak\nout!\"\n\"Let go the horses' heads!\" said Piers. \"Let go! How dare you obstruct\nthe high road?\"\n\"Aye! aye! you young fool; we'll teach you manners!\" and one of the men\nclenched his fist and shook it at Piers. In another moment the crowd\nfrom behind, which Susan Priday had seen, came breathlessly up the hill,\nwomen with children in their arms, all screaming, at the top of their\nvoices, \"Reform! Reform!\"\nOne woman held up a child with a pinched, wan face, and said--\n\"You rich folks, you'd trample on us if you could, and we are starving!\nLook here!\" and she bared the legs of the poor emaciated baby. \"Look\nhere! Look at your fat, stuffed-out childer, and look at _this_!\"\n\"Look 'ee here, missus; we are a-going to Bristol to cry for Reform. If\nyou say you will have nothing to do with the tyrant, Wetherall, and his\ncursed lot, you may go on. If not, we'll seize the carriage, we'll turn\nye all out into the road, and we'll drive in state to the big meeting in\nQueen's Square! My! what a lark that will be!\"\n\"Listen,\" Joyce said, standing up in the carriage with her child in her\narms; \"I am on my way home with these little children. Surely you will\nnot stop me and endanger their lives?\"\n\"We will! we will! if you don't give us your word you are for Reform and\ndead against Wetherall.\"\n\"Why,\" Joyce said fearlessly, \"only a year ago, and near this very\nplace, the men and women of Bristol shouted, 'Long live Wetherall!' And\nnow!\"\n\"Now we say, _curse_ him!\" growled a big, brawny man.\nThe little girls, awakened by the uproar, began to cry with fear, and\nFalcon called out, \"Let mother go on, you bad men! I say, let her go on!\nFather will be so angry with you!\"\n\"Hush! hush! dear Master Falcon,\" Susan said; \"you will only make them\nworse. Hush!\"\nAnd now, as Joyce looked over the faces crowding round her, she beckoned\nto the woman, who had been thrust back by the pressure of others who\nwanted to see the inhabitants of the carriage.\n\"Come here,\" she said, holding out some of the buns; \"I am so sorry for\nyour hungry baby. Give her one of these buns, and do believe me when I\nsay I am sorry for all your troubles.\"\nThe sweet, ringing voice began to have effect, and the clamour ceased.\n\"I am no enemy of the poor. My husband and I wish to do what we can for\nyou, and I believe, nay, I know, he is an advocate of Reform, but not\nfor rebellion against authority, and violence.\"\nThe execrations were changed now to cheers.\n\"Let 'em pass, she is a good 'un; let 'em pass, she has a kind heart;\nshe has a pretty face, too. Here,\" said a man, \"I am the father of that\npoor babby; shake hands, missus.\"\nJoyce stretched out her hand at once, and it was taken in a strong grip.\n\"Thank you,\" she said; \"I knew you would not be cruel to my little\nchildren. Will you all remember that I ask you to be peaceable, and to\npray to God to help you and give you bread for your children. He is a\nkind and loving Father; don't forget that.\"\nAs Joyce stood before that seething crowd of strange, wan faces, for\nmany of them bore too plainly the marks of fasting and hunger, the baby\nin her arms raised a pitiful cry, and she pressed it closer and soothed\nit, while the baby lifted its little hand and stroked its mother's face.\n\"Aye, she is of the right sort,\" they cried; \"she is a mother who loves\nher child. She ain't too grand to cosset her babby. Let her go on!\"\nThe post-boy cracked his whip, and the carriage was just starting, when",

Oh, it was the sight of his\nface which was too much for me! And poor Susan saw him also. It brought\nit all back. Father! father!\"\nGilbert stroked his wife's head tenderly as it lay upon his shoulder,\nand said:\n\"Are you sure it was Bob Priday? So many years have passed.\"\n\"Quite, quite sure. And, though I have not spoken to Susan yet, I _know_\nshe is sure also.\"\n\"You did not tell your mother, then, or Piers?\"\n\"No, no; I would not have given mother the pain I felt, for anything.\nDear mother! I let her drive off with scarcely a good-bye, and she has\nbeen so kind at Fair Acres, and has enjoyed the children in the old\nhouse. But, oh! Gilbert,\" she said, rallying, \"it is so delightful to be\nat home with you again. While we have each other nothing can be _very_\nbad, can it?\"\n\"Nothing,\" he said, fervently. \"And now, while you are resting, I must\ngo down to the office, for my partner is at the meeting at the \"White\nLion,\" helping to bolster up poor Hart-Davies to fight the Tories'\nbattle. He is a good fellow, and everybody respects him; but the truth\nis, the tide is too strong in Bristol now for any but some very\nexceptional man to battle against it.\"\n\"You think the Whigs will carry the election?\"\n\"Without a doubt.\"\n\"Are you going to the meeting in Queen's Square?\"\n\"I think not. We cannot both leave the office at once, and I do not\ngreatly care about it. I do increasingly feel that these men who clamour\nfor their cause injure it. They are exciting the mob in Bristol--always\ninflammable material--and this fury of rage against old Wetherall is\nmost dangerous. Everyone expects that if he attempts to open the next\nassize there will be a riot it will be difficult to quell. Happy little\nJoy,\" he said, kissing the baby's cheek; \"to sleep on in peace while\nyour fellow-citizens of Bristol are shouting themselves hoarse.\"\nSusan now came in from the next room, and took the baby from Joyce,\nwhile Gilbert left the nursery, saying:\n\"We must dine at a fashionable hour to-day. I shall not be back till\nfive;\"--and Susan and her mistress were left alone.\n\"Did he see us, Susan? Your father; do you think he saw us?\"\n\"I think he did, ma'am--at least, I think he saw me.\"\n\"You feel no doubt at all that it was your father, Susan?\"\n\"No, oh no!\" said poor Susan, struggling to restrain her convulsive\nsobs; \"and I don't know what is to be done. Oh, dear, dear, madam!\"\n\"We must leave it in God's hands, Susan.\"\n\"If he finds me out it will be so dreadful; but I don't think he will\ndare to do so.\"\n\"No,\" Joyce said; \"he will hide away from us knowing that suspicion, at\nleast, must have fastened on him.\"\n\"Dear madam, I wonder you have ever been able to bear to have me near\nyou. His daughter!--_his_ daughter!\"\n\"I thought we had settled long ago, Susan, that your services to me and\nmine, and your love for the children, must always win my gratitude\nand----\"\n\"Dear madam, I know how good you are. I know how you took me out of the\nlowest depths of misery, just as no one else would have done. But if I\nam to bring trouble on you by staying here, if he, my father, is to\nbring more trouble on you, I would rather run away and hide myself, and\nnever look upon your face again.\"\n\"Do not say so, Susan; let us trust in God, and He will protect us. Your\nfather, if he recognised me, which I doubt, is very unlikely to come\nforward when a serious charge might be brought against him. It was a\ngreat shock at first for me to see him; but let us dismiss it from our\nminds now, and do not let us speak of it to anyone but Mr. Arundel.",

Of course, there is a good scold every day of one or\nthe other of them, but both the maids know by this time, as we all do,\nthat mother's bark may be sharp, but her bite is nothing.\"\n\"I hope you are not very dull, darling Piers?\" Joyce asked.\n\"Dull! No, thank goodness! I don't know what dullness means. I see you\nhave brought Charlotte with you; she is as languishing as ever.\"\n\"Poor Charlotte!\" Joyce said; \"she, at any rate, knows very well what\ndullness means. But I must not stay; remember you and mother are to\nspend Christmas with us in Great George Street.\"\nThe Clifton of fifty-five year's ago might not present such an\nappearance of gaiety on a fine afternoon as it does now; but,\nnevertheless, the Downs and Observatory were sprinkled with people, well\ndressed, in carriages, or Bath chairs, or on foot.\nIt was decided that the carriage should be ordered by Joyce from the\nstables at the back of Sion Hill, as she went to Windsor Terrace; that\nMrs. Falconer, Piers, and Charlotte should drive to the turnpike on the\nDown, and then come to the top of Granby Hill, and wait there for Joyce.\nCharlotte was quite content with this arrangement, and watched Joyce's\ndeparture after dinner with some satisfaction. She rather liked to be\nalone with Mrs. Falconer, who, as she knitted, listened to her little\ncomplaints with patience, if not with expressed sympathy. Mrs. Arundel,\non the contrary, thought Charlotte needed rousing, and was intolerant of\nperpetual headaches and low spirits.\nThere were many unoccupied young women like Charlotte, fifty years ago,\nwithout any particular aim in life, except a vague idea that they ought\nto be married. The years as they passed, often went by on leaden wings.\nCharlotte was amiable and gentle; and Miss Falconer, disappointed with\nthe result of her training, would say: \"Poor dear Charlotte has not\nstrong health; so different from Joyce, who was a perfect rustic in\nthat, as in other things.\" But Joyce was married, and Charlotte remained\nsingle, and had not even the satisfaction of recounting her many\nconquests, as her aunt so frequently did.\nThere is no more honourable and noble life than that of the single woman\nwho bravely takes up her lot, and works her way to independence, by\nindustry and the cultivation of the gifts God has given her, for which\nthe opportunities in these days are so many. But there is--I had almost\nsaid _was_--no life more pitiable, than that of the woman whose youth is\npassing, and who, having to accept her position as unmarried, does so\nwith a bad grace, and pines for what, by her very melancholy views of\nlife, she puts more and more beyond her reach, and who is perpetually\nthinking of her own little pains and troubles, and forgets to be at\nleisure from herself, to sympathise with those of others.",

And\nnow the knitting-needles were laid aside, for the carriage stopped at\nthe little iron gate, and Mrs. Falconer went to call Piers, and to\nprepare for her drive.\nMeantime Joyce had gone down the steep hill to Windsor Terrace, and,\nafter some hesitation on the part of Miss Frowde, she was allowed to see\nMrs. More.\nShe was seated in an easy chair, propped up with cushions, enjoying the\nview which lay before her.\nFor a moment she sought Joyce's face with an inquiring glance, as if not\nquite sure of her identity; but almost immediately the recognition came,\nand she greeted her, with one of her brightest smiles.\n\"Why, my dear Mrs. Arundel, you are quite a stranger. How are the dear\nbabies, and poor Susan?\"\n\"They are all well, dear madam, and Susan is an increasingly valuable\nservant.\"\n\"I am glad to hear it. I love to know that the seed sown is springing\nup. We are sadly impatient, my dear; we are like children pulling up the\nplant to see if the roots are grown. How are things going on at Fair\nAcres?\"\n\"Very much as usual. My brother Ralph manages the estate.\"\n\"And the others look on! Well, well, patience is the great lesson for us\nall to learn, the patience that God has with us. Prayer and patient\nwaiting will move mountains at last.\"\nThen, after a few more inquiries, Mrs. More came to public matters.\n\"I thought,\" she said, \"I was too old to take such a deep interest in\nthe affairs of this kingdom and this city; but, my dear, we stand on the\nedge of a volcano, and, from all I hear, Bristol is ill-prepared. There\nis a growing feeling of hatred against the magistrates, and the zeal of\nSir Charles Wetherall has carried him beyond the bounds of discretion.\nWould you like to borrow any books? They are at your service. In that\nbook-case there are many volumes written by me. I often sit here, and\nthink over the writing of those books, and how little I ever expected\nthat they would have a large sale, and bring me in, as they did, thirty\nthousand pounds. It often fills me with self-abasement, not\nself-glorification.\"\n\"I will not take a book to-day, dear madam; and here is Miss Frowde come\nto warn me that I have stayed long enough.\"\n\"See!\" Mrs. More said, \"there is the little steam-packet puffing busily\nup the river. I am blessed in my old age, to see before my windows the\ntwo great discoveries of the age, steam-power made useful for\nlocomotion, and coal-gas for light. I am very happy here, my dear, but\nremember an old woman's advice, and do not spoil Susan Priday, or any\nservant, by over indulgence. Very often, as in my own case,\ncarelessness, and dislike of trouble is the real root of the evil. God\nbless you and keep you, my dear,\" she said, as Joyce bent to kiss her.\n\"Is there much excitement abroad about the passing of the Reform Bill?\"\n\"Not that I have seen,\" Joyce answered; \"but I daresay there may be in\nthe city.\"\n\"Well, the result is in God's hands; we must pray and labour for peace,\nthat blessed gift of God's love--peace.\"\nIt was a sweet parting word, and one to which Joyce often recurred in",

The Bristol clocks had\nstruck eleven; and from time to time the noise of the voices of many\npeople reached her, borne upon the still night air. She had sent the\nservants to bed; and Mrs. Arundel and Charlotte were also gone to their\nrooms; but Joyce sat up watching for Gilbert's return.\nThe baby Joy, was sleeping in her cradle, and Lettice and Lota in their\ncribs, while Falcon lay in profound repose, a fife, upon which he had\nbeen playing hard all day, as he marched round and round the garden, was\nclasped in his strong, round little fingers.\nJoyce bent over the children, shading the candle with her hand, to\nassure herself they slept, and then, leaving the nursery door open, that\nshe might hear if they stirred or cried, she went gently down the wide\nstaircase to the hall. The fire in the dining-room was burning low, and\nshe put on some more coal, and saw that the kettle just simmered on the\nhob, ready to be put on to the fire when Gilbert came.\nShe moved with that quiet, almost stealthy tread, which is common with\nthose who feel themselves the only persons awake in a house.\nThe stillness was broken by the ticking of the clock in the hall, and\nhow loud that tick sounded!\nJoyce went to the window, and, unfastening the shutter, looked out into\nthe night, a dark, murky night; and from below came the low murmur of\nthe crowds, which had not yet dispersed.\nPublic feeling throughout the country had reached almost to fever heat,\nbut in Bristol the animosity against Bishops and Lords, for the\nrejection of the Reform Bill which the Commons had passed, was quickened\nby the personal hatred, which the recorder, Sir Charles Wetherall had\nexcited amongst the people.\nBristol reformers were enraged that he should have made a bitter attack\nupon Lord John Russell in the House of Commons, charging him most\nunfairly with encouraging illegal means for carrying the Reform Bill.\nThough the whole country was in a ferment, and riots had broken out in\nDerby, Nottingham, and other towns, in no place was there such a\npersonal feeling excited as against the Recorder of Bristol.\nThe assizes would soon open, and vengeance was vowed against him, if he\nattempted to enter the city to perform his duties as a judge.\nBoth parties vied with each other in exciting bitterness and ill\nfeeling; and all good, moderate men felt, in their own minds, that a\ncrisis was at hand, and that, unless some wise and able pilot could be\nfound to guide the helm, a most disastrous shipwreck must follow.",

Gilbert was, in his heart,\nwhat was called a whig, but he was far, indeed, from being a hot-headed\nradical.\nThat he was known to be the grandson of a peer, and that his mother had\na title, did not win him favour with the extreme section of his own\nparty, while the others, perhaps, were a little triumphant that the son\nof a noble house might yet question the wisdom of the Lords in rejecting\na Bill which was so dear to the heart of the people.\nJoyce gently closed the shutters and returned to her place by the fire.\nThen she went out into the hall, where an oil lamp was dimly burning,\nand looked out from a small window by the side of the door.\nA sense of fear began to creep over her, not for herself, but for\nGilbert. She listened for his step with that nervous tension which is so\npainful, and of which we all know something.\nPresently the door of the cellar, which opened into the hall, creaked;\nJoyce watched it breathlessly; it opened wider and wider, and a man's\nhead appeared.

My\nfour little children are asleep upstairs. There is no one in the house\nbut women, helpless women, one of whom is your own daughter--your _own\ndaughter_.\"\n\"I wouldn't hurt a hair of her head, nor yours, nor your childer's.

I cannot bear it,\" Joyce said.\n\"He was riding peaceable enough, and I laid in wait for 'im. I got hold\nof the bridle, and the horse, she backed and reared, and the squire he\nfell on a sharp stone, which cut his forehead--a three corner cut--I see\nit now. He lay like a dog, dead, and the horse galloped off, and\nI--well, I made off too, and got aboard a ship in Bristol Docks, and\nonly came back last Christmas. I meant to threaten the squire; but I\ndidn't kill 'im; I didn't _want_ to kill 'im.\"\n\"Your act killed him as much as if you had thrown the stone, as we all\nbelieved you did. Oh! I pray God may forgive you.\"\n\"Say you forgive me,\" the man muttered; \"I wouldn't hurt a hair of your\nhead.\"\n\"I pray God to forgive you, and I try to do as the Lord Jesus would have\nme, and forgive you. But, oh! leave your evil ways, and turn to Him.\"\n\"It's too late,\" he said.\n\"Oh! no! no!--never! never too late!\"\nThe man was silent for a few minutes; then he spoke in a low harsh\nvoice:\n\"Give my love to poor Sue. I broke her mother's heart, and I nearly\nbroke her's. I saw her riding in the carriage with you, like a lady, in\nthe spring. Her mother used to pray God to take care of her, and sure\nenough, He has. It must be pretty nigh like heaven to live along with\nyou. I'm a-going out by the way I came. Now you just see that the cellar\nwinder bars is mended; that's how I got in, and others may get in too. I\nsuppose you couldn't say, God bless you?\"\nThe restraint Joyce had put upon herself was very great, and now that\nthe danger seemed passing, she began to give way.\n\"Yes,\" she said faintly; \"I think you are sorry, and I say, may God\npardon you and bless you.\"\n\"Thank'ee,\" was the rejoinder; but still, though he moved back towards\nthe cellar door, he lingered.\n\"Suppose you wouldn't touch the likes of me with your little white hand?\nI'd like to feel it once, just once.\"\nWith a great effort she held out her hand, cold and trembling with fear.\nThe man took it up, as he would some curious and precious thing, and\nthen, bowing over it, he waited no longer, and the cellar-door closed\nbehind him.",

He is penitent, I think;\nand he said dear father fell from the horse, and that he did not\nactually throw the stone at him. Oh! Gilbert, it seems to bring it all\nback again.\"\n\"Dismiss it from your thoughts to-night, my darling, we shall need all\nour strength and courage. I am sworn in as a special constable. The\npeople show increasingly signs of ill-will against those in authority.\nIf Wetherall persists in making a public entry into Bristol next week,\nGod only knows what will be the consequences. No one seems to be able to\ntake active measures. The mayor is kindly and well-intentioned, but he\nhas no strength of purpose, and if once the mob gets the upper hand,\nand those in authority are frightened, there will be a riot such as\nBristol has never known. I think, if things do not look more promising,\nI must send you to Abbot's Leigh with my mother and the babies, and\nCharlotte Benson had better go home. There is a house at Abbots Leigh,\nBenson, my partner, will let me have, and you would be out of harm's way\nthere.\"\n\"Oh! Gilbert, surely you do not mean that I am to leave you? I could\nnot--I will not leave you!\"\n\"You will do what I think is best and right, like a brave, good wife.\nYou would not add to my anxiety, I am sure. I have seen enough in\nBristol to-day to feel certain there will be a desperate struggle before\nthe city quiets down. Only imagine that man, Captain Claxton, being so\nmad as to call a meeting of sailors on board the two ships now in the\nharbour, the 'Charles' and the 'Earl of Liverpool,' under pretence of\nvoting a loyal address to the king, but really to get the sailors to\nform a guard to protect Wetherall when he enters Bristol. Could anything\nbe more likely to enrage the other party? The meeting was broken up and\nadjourned to the quay, where the anti-reformers passed the resolution in\na great uproar, protesting loyalty to the king, but declaring they will\nnot be made a cat's paw of by the corporation and paid agents. The\nnotion of protesting this publicly in the face of all the orders of the\nmayor! They are going to send a deputation to Wetherall to beg him not\nto persist in coming in next Saturday; but I am afraid it will be\nuseless. If anything could have added to my own share in the troubles of\nthe city, it is that Maythorne has chosen this time to come to the hotel\nin Clifton. He is a mere wreck, and so broken down that he looks like an\nold man instead of in his prime, but he is as bumptious as ever.\"\nJoyce had roused herself now. The idea of Gilbert's danger was enough to\ndrive away every other anxiety.\nShe made him take the refreshment which he so greatly needed, and,\nthough pale and exhausted, she felt it almost a relief to busy herself\nin any way which diverted her mind from the terrible half-hour she had\ngone through in the hall face to face with Bob Priday.\n\"Why is Maythorne's coming so vexatious to you?\" she asked; \"I mean,\nmore vexatious than usual.\"\n\"My dear child,\" Gilbert said, \"the very fact of his title, and my\nconnection with it, would be enough to ensure brickbats and stones to\nbe hurled at my head if he is seen with me. Let us hope he will keep to\nthe more aristocratic quarters of Clifton, and not come near us.\"\n\"I think,\" Joyce said, when at last they prepared to go upstairs to bed;\n\"I think I should like to hear you give God thanks for my safety, and\nthat strength was given me not to cry out or scream; but oh! Gilbert,\nGilbert, I _was_ so frightened!\"\nAgain he soothed her and comforted her, and then he raised his voice,\nthe manly tones touched with pathos, and thanked God for His mercy,\ncommitting his wife and her little children to His care.",

He came up from Bristol\nabout four o'clock in the afternoon of this memorable Saturday, weary\nand dispirited, and found, to his dismay, that his uncle was in the\ndrawing-room.\nHe was lounging on a sofa, holding a skein of silk for Charlotte\nBenson's embroidery, affecting, at forty, the airs and manners of a\nyoung beau, and talking an immense deal of nonsense to poor Charlotte,\nwhich she was only too ready to drink in.\nCharlotte had begged to remain in Bristol at the early part of the week;\nand, as the days passed on, it became more and more difficult to think\nof leaving it. The mail coaches and passenger vans, as well as private\ncarriages, were continually stopped, and the travellers were roughly\nasked whether they were for Reform, or against it; for the Lords, or\nready to cry \"_Down with the Lords!_\"\nIn many instances quiet people, who cared very little about politics,\nand understood less, were seriously frightened, and even injured by the\nswift hurling of a stone or a brickbat.\nAs soon as Joyce heard her husband's step, she ran out to the hall.\nSusan Priday was also on the look-out, with Joy in her arms.\nGilbert looked worn out, and threw himself into a chair, saying:\n\"I believe it is all but impossible to avoid a riot now. I wish you and\nthe children and my mother were safe at Abbot's Leigh. Indeed, it is\nnot too late now to get you up to Down Cottage, and----\"\n[Illustration: High Street, Bristol.]\n\"I cannot leave you, Gilbert; do not ask me,\" Joyce said.\n\"Tell us what has happened in Bristol. We hear the uproar from these\nwindows,\" his mother said.\n\"Oh! let them fight it out,\" said Lord Maythorne, \"let them fight it\nout. They won't touch us.\"\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said Gilbert, sharply. \"I have a suspicion\nthat you, for one, would get rough handling if some of the malcontents\ncaught you.\"\nLord Maythorne laughed. \"I should like to see them try.

The yells and hisses of two thousand people were a\nsufficient proof of this. The sheriff's carriage could scarcely make its\nway through the masses of people, and several stones were hurled at it.\nSir Charles Wetherall reached the Guildhall about twelve o'clock, and\nthe commission was read. It might have passed off fairly, had not that\nstupid though well meaning fellow, Ludlow, began to allude to Reform. It\nwas like a spark to tinder, and there was an instant uproar; amidst it\nthe court adjourned to eight o'clock on Monday morning. Every one means\nwell; but there is no leader for our body of special constables, and\nsome of the paid fellows are worse than useless. The Recorder is now at\nthe Mansion House in Queen's Square, and we were ordered to rest, but\nnot before several of our number were a good deal hurt, and in every\nencounter the mob had the best of it. They have armed themselves with\nsticks, and one poor fellow was chased into the Float, and many more\nmust have been hurt.\"\n\"Are you hurt, Gilbert?\"\n\"A few bruises, nothing worse; but it is imperative that the children\nand Susan should go up to Clifton Down.

We have the gardener to\nprotect us, and the cook is a sensible woman. Pray please, let your\nmother take her maid and Susan, and, _do_ leave me here. Think how\ndreadful it would be to me to be beyond reach if--if anything happened\nto you, if you were hurt. Nay, Gilbert, do not refuse me.\"\n\"Well, I will yield for this one night, and to-morrow, being Sunday,\nthere may be peace; but I doubt it. Get the others under marching\norders; and, Joyce;\" as she was leaving the room, \"I am not very well\npleased to see my uncle hanging about here, and filling that poor girl's\nhead with nonsense. She is just as likely to fancy he is making love to\nher as not. Warn her, can't you?\"\nJoyce shook her head. \"It is not easy to persuade Charlotte that\neveryone is not ready to fall at her feet, and I am afraid she will\nresent any interference; but, oh!\" she continued gaily, \"I will do\nanything now I am not to be sent away from _you_.\"\nThen she hastened upstairs and found Susan and Mary bustling about for\ndeparture.\nJoyce told Falcon he was to stay to take care of her, and he shouted for\njoy. He had again taken up his post at the open nursery windows, leaning\nover the bars, and listening to the ever increasing tumult which reigned\nin the city below.\n\"Oh! dear madam,\" Susan said; \"I don't like to leave you.\"\n\"You like to please me, Susan, and there is no danger for me.\"\n\"The cellar window is made fast, I know,\" Susan said, \"and he--he can\nnever come near you again; but suppose the mob should come up here, and\nmaster not be able to reach you.\"\n\"That is not likely; by to-morrow all may be quiet, and I shall come to\nDown Cottage to see how you have got on. You must give mother my love,\nand tell her I know she will like to have Baby Joy to-night, and that\nyou can sleep with Lettice and Lota.\"\n\"Don't be afraid, my darlings,\" she said, as two little serious faces\nwere turned up to her, and two little plaintive voices said:\n\"We want to stay with mother. Falcon is going to stay.\"\n\"Falcon is a boy, and he likes to watch the crowds, and does not mind\nthe noise, and he is going to take care of me. Now then, darlings, run\ndown and tell father you are ready, while I go and see if grandmother\nand Mary, and cousin Charlotte are ready also.\"\nBut Mrs. Arundel had determined to remain with Joyce, and said nothing\nshould tempt her to leave her; her maid Mary should go, and she would\nstay behind.\nJoyce thought of the rather small accommodation at Down Cottage, and did\nnot raise any further objection. There was only Charlotte now to hasten.\nJoyce found her tying her bonnet and arranging her curls under it, and\nturning her head first to one side, then to the other, to catch a\nglimpse of her profile in the glass.\n\"Come, Charlotte, make haste,\" Joyce said; \"they are all ready.\"\n\"Is Lord Maythorne coming with us?\"\n\"Yes, as far as the Hotel. If I were you I should not desire his\ncompany.\"\n\"Oh! Joyce, he is very nice, quite delightful, and he is--\"\n\"He is given to flatter everybody,\" Joyce said, \"as years ago poor\nMelville found to his cost. So take care, Charlotte.\"\n\"Take care, indeed! I don't know what you mean,\" said Charlotte,\npouting. \"You always think no one can possibly admire _me_.\"\n\"My dear Charlotte, this is not a time for such nonsense, it is time to\ncommend ourselves and all we love to God's care, and not to be filled\nwith thoughts of who admires us and who does not. Lord Maythorne is\nGilbert's uncle; but he has caused a great deal of sorrow in the family,\nand we were all very sorry when he came to live in England again. Mrs.\nArundel cannot be uncivil to him, but she has not the slightest respect\nfor him; neither have I.\"\n\"Well, dear,\" said Charlotte, \"now you have finished your lecture, I\nwill go downstairs. I suppose you think, as you are--are married, you\nmay----\"\nCharlotte's ready tears began to flow, and Joyce, losing her patience,\npassed by her quickly, and ran down into the hall.\nIt was hard to bid them all \"good-bye,\" her baby smiling at her from\nunder her warm hood, Lettice and Lota clinging to her, and Susan looking\nback to the last moment, as she led the way down Great George Street\nwith Joy in her arms.\n\"You must give Uncle Piers my love, you know,\" Joyce said, \"and say I am\ncoming to-morrow. Good-bye; good-bye.\"\nShe stood at the door watching her husband and children down the street,\nwhich opens into Park Street, kissing her hand to them as the little\ngirls' figures disappeared round the corner.\nLord Maythorne and Charlotte were rather longer in setting out, and a\ngreat deal of hesitation on Charlotte's part, and coaxing on Lord\nMaythorne's, was necessary, before they too at last departed.

They tore up the iron\nrailings in front of the Mansion House, and hooted and scoffed at the\nRiot Act, which was read by the Mayor's order, and the force of special\nconstables was quite insufficient.\nGilbert saw this at once, and now, when the cry arose: \"Fire the Mansion\nHouse!\" it was a relief to see some action taken, by a troop of the 14th\nLight Dragoons, and Dragoon Guards trotting into the Square.\nThere was to all noble-hearted men, something terribly humiliating in\nthe aspect of affairs. Here was a seething, ignorant crowd of men,\nwomen, and boys, intimidating the magistrates, frightening the Mayor\ntill he actually barricaded his windows in the Mansion House with his\nbed; and Sir Charles Wetherall beating an undignified retreat from the\nflat roof of the dining-room. There, helped by a woman's hand, who set\nup a ladder for him, he dropped in pitiable terror into the stables\nbehind, and hid in a loft. Gilbert, standing on guard by the corner of\nthe Square with four friends bravely holding their ground, and warding\noff with their staves the excited crowd, recognised in the dim light the\nRecorder slipping by, in a post-boy's dress, which actually passed him\nthrough the crowd, till he found himself safe at Kingsdown. And if the\ncowardice of the Recorder, in escaping for dear life from the storm he\nhad himself roused was unprecedented, the wavering uncertainty of the\nColonel in command of the troops was scarcely less reprehensible!\nHow Gilbert longed to take a prominent part, and how his heart burned\nwith righteous indignation against the weakness and incapacity of those\nin command.",

It was no easy\nmatter, but at last it was accomplished, and a pair of dark, blood-shot\neyes were turned on Gilbert. The man tried to articulate, but no sound\ncame. As the cart was moving off, Gilbert saw he made a desperate\neffort.\nHe raised his hand, and cried out with all his remaining strength, \"Tell\nyour good lady I kept my word, and I saved you from harm!\"\n\"Stop!\" Gilbert said to the driver, \"stop; this man has saved my life. I\nmust come to the Infirmary to see he has proper care and attention.\"",

Piers, impossible! she cannot be so foolish.\"\n\"My dear, it would be a long plumb-line to sound her folly, or his\neither.\"\n\"But he is in difficulties as to money; he came here because he wanted\nto get some out of his sister.\"\n\"Has Aunt Letitia any money?\" Piers asked.\n\"Of course, she has her own income, and----\"\n\"Will leave it all to Charlotte.

Piers, I\nshould like to go to the Infirmary, and take Susan with me. Will you\nhelp us, and come with us?\"\n\"You may get into another scrimmage, Joyce; is it right?\"\n\"I think it is right,\" Joyce said, gently; \"I asked God about it, you\nknow.\"\nHere was Joyce's sense of strength in weakness; she had always a refuge\nand a Councillor at hand. Her religion was not one of many words; it was\nemphatically the religion of Peace--and in quietness and confidence she\ncould rest.\n\"It seems to me, Piers, as if it would be cruel to deny a dying man this\nlast act of grace.\"\n\"He does not deserve it.\"\n\"Ah! Piers, what do we deserve of God?\"\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I will go with you if I can get a hackney-coach; a\nlame fellow like me can't very well trudge down there on foot. But as\nyou do everything to please other people, it is only fair I should try\nto please you.\"\n\"I don't wish to tell mother yet, but I will go and call Susan, dear,\ngood Susan, and tell her to get ready.\"\n\"I hope she won't make a scene,\" Piers said, \"I hate scenes, and I don't\nsee what good you will do, but here goes;\" and Piers took his hat and\nwent to do his sister's bidding.",

The deanery escaped by the pluck of the old Dean. He came out and\nharangued the rioters, saying, 'Wait a bit, let's have three cheers\nfirst--one cheer for the king, one cheer for the people, and one for\nthe old Dean!' The mob cheered lustily, and turned off to find other\nprey. They say Park Street is to follow, and those houses which are\ndoomed are to have a white mark for a sign; but there is no order\namongst them, and every one of the chief rioters is drunk with the\nBishop's wine, taken from the cellars, which they have sold for a penny\na bottle! Now they have set fire to Queen's Square, and the Mansion\nHouse is one blazing pile. The Mayor has come up to Berkley Square,\nwhere I must follow him. The special constables were separated from him\nin the crowd, and, can you believe it, Brereton's troops, after parading\nround Queen's Square, have retired to their quarters. Confusion\neverywhere, and no one knows what may come next. I must not stay; but,\nMrs. Arundel, you may be thankful for the blow on your husband's head,\nyesterday, which has, perhaps, saved his life. Upon my honour, I don't\nbelieve any man outside his own doors to-night can depend upon living to\nsee the morning break.\"\nWhen Mr. Bengough was gone, Joyce heard the frightened servants crying\nout, that the fire was bigger than ever, and that they were sure the\nhouse would catch fire, and they would all be burned alive.\nMrs. Arundel could not calm their fears, and scarcely control her own,\nand Joyce alone preserved any self-possession.\n\"The panes of glass are hot in the nursery!\" they said; \"come up there,\nma'am, and see if it is not true.\"\n\"Do not wake Master Falcon or disturb your master. Remember you are--we\nall are--in God's hands.\"\nBut, as Joyce looked out from the vantage ground of the nursery windows,\nthe terrified servants clinging to her, with cries and exclamations, the\nsight was one too awful for any words to paint.

I\nsuppose Charlotte Benson is gone home? The Wells coach is running\nagain.\"\nIn all the excitement of the past ten days, Joyce had really thought but\nlittle of Charlotte, and when her mother did not reply to the question\nat once, she said:\n\"What day did Charlotte go home?\"\n\"She is not gone home at all; you had better ask Piers about her.\"\n\"Is anything wrong?\" Joyce asked.\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Falconer, in her old blunt fashion, \"I believe\nCharlotte thinks everything is right, not wrong, but Piers is of a\ndifferent opinion. As for myself, I am no judge of lords and grand\nfolks, nor their ways neither. But Charlotte thinks she is going to be\n'my lady,' and that's about the truth.\"\n\"Mother!\" Joyce exclaimed; \"mother, it must be prevented; it is\nimpossible. How wrong we have all been to be so engrossed with our own\nconcerns and forget Charlotte's. I had really forgotten Lord Maythorne\nwas here. What will Mrs. Arundel say? Where is Piers?\"\nThe tap of Piers' crutches was now heard on the flag-stones before Down\nCottage, and he came in.\n\"I am glad you are come Joyce; it is time some one interfered. I have\njust been acting the spy on the Observatory Hill, and there are\nCharlotte and her elderly beau disporting themselves.\"\n\"Oh! Piers, it is really dreadful. I must tell Gilbert at once, and Mrs.\nArundel. It will worry Gilbert dreadfully, and he is still so weak.\"\n\"You need not look so doleful, Joyce; after all, if people will make\ntheir own bed of thorns, they must bear the prick when they lie down on\nit. It all comes of Aunt Letitia's silly bringing up. Charlotte has\nbeen made a foolish, sentimental woman, and this is the end of it.\"\n\"It must not be the end; I must do all I can to prevent it. Call Susan\nto bring Joy, and we will go home at once. I must consult Mrs. Arundel,\nand ask her what it is best to do.\"\n\"You won't have time, for here they come,\" Piers said.\nYes; there was Charlotte, with her head on one side, and evidently\nsimpering at some compliment, which her companion was administering.\nWhen they came into the sitting-room, and stood face to face with Joyce,\none betrayed some annoyance, and the other some triumph.\n\"I thought you would have gone home yesterday, Charlotte,\" Joyce said,\nafter the first greeting. \"Is not Aunt Letitia anxious to see you? This\nhouse is very full,\" she added, \"and Gilbert is not well enough for me\nto ask you to return to Great George Street.\"\n\"I am going to Wells to-morrow, dear,\" Charlotte said, \"and--and--\"\n\"I am to have the honour of escorting Miss Benson to Wells,\" Lord\nMaythorne said, in his honeyed accents.\n\"Indeed; I am sorry to hear it,\" Joyce said, sharply.\n\"I want to see my very old friend, now he is turned into a Benedict, at\nFair Acres, and who knows if I may not follow his example. I have known\nGratian, I may almost say, from childhood; I cannot profess to have that\nhonour with regard to you, fair niece.\"\nJoyce felt too angry to trust herself to reply, but she turned to\nCharlotte, and said:\n\"I want to speak to you, Charlotte, in Piers' room.\"\nJoyce's tone was one of command rather than of entreaty, and Charlotte\nfollowed meekly.\nAs soon as the door was shut, she said: \"Surely Charlotte, you are not\ngoing to travel to Wells alone with Lord Maythorne?\"\nCharlotte drew herself erect.\n\"Yes, I am. Why not? I am engaged to be married to him.\"\n\"Oh, Charlotte! it must not be thought of. Aunt Letitia will not allow\nit.\"\n\"Auntie not only allows it, but is quite pleased,\" Charlotte said.\n\"Some one must interfere. I cannot see you wilfully ruin the happiness\nof your whole life by such an act.\"\n\"That's just what he said,\" Charlotte exclaimed. \"He said he knew you\nwould make objections, because Gilbert has often meddled in his\nconcerns before; but that will not change me. If you--if\nyou\"--Charlotte broke down, and became tearful--\"had been so hungry for\nsomebody to care for you as I have been, and had known what it was to be\nslighted and looked down upon, you would not be so cruel. It is all very\nwell for _you_. But you never did care what became of poor me, and I--I\nused to love you so much, Joyce.\"\nCharlotte began to sob piteously, and Joyce felt she must appear\nhard-hearted, and take the consequences.\nJust as she had dispelled the vision of the raindrop which was to revive\nthe drooping rose many years ago, so now she must do her best to dispel\na far more dangerous illusion.\n\"Lord Maythorne is not a good man,\" she said; \"he is continually in\ndebt; he often plays high, and he has been living abroad all these years\nin what manner we hardly know. We believe that he came to Bristol now,\nsimply to get some money out of his sister, my mother-in-law. Surely,\nCharlotte, you must see that if you marry him you will be miserable.\"\n\"Gratian married Melville, and you prophesied the same then; and they\nare very happy.\"\n\"That is a very different case. Gratian is older, wiser, and stronger\nthan Melville, and keeps him right by the force of her own will.\nBesides, Melville was weak, and easily yielded to temptation; but he was\nnot like Lord Maythorne, who did his best to ruin him in his Oxford\ndays.\"\n\"He says--he says that is all a lie of Gilbert's.\"\n\"How dare you speak like that of my husband! A lie! As if he ever\nstooped to tell a lie.\" Joyce flushed angrily, and continued: \"You are a\npoor, weak, sentimental girl, not a girl, for you are nearly thirty, and\nif you do not know what is good for you, you must be taken care of. If\nmy little Lettice wished to eat anything that was poisonous I should\ntake it from her, and by the same rule I shall treat you.\"\n\"You have no right over me. Aunt Letitia knows, and _she_ approves, and\nexpects us to-morrow.\"\nBut Joyce did not give in one whit.\n\"Aunt Letitia must be enlightened then,\" she said, \"without loss of\ntime, and I shall take care that she knows the true character of the man\nto whom she thinks of entrusting you.\"\nCharlotte tried to rally herself, and began to laugh hysterically.\n\"You think so much of yourself, and that you are so wise, and that\nGilbert has made you just like himself, you both think yourselves so\ngood and perfect.\"\nJoyce told herself it was foolish as well as wrong to be angry with\nCharlotte, who was so unreasoning and feeble-minded.\nShe left her abruptly, called Susan and the baby, had many rapturous\nhugs from her little girls and Falcon and then kissing her mother, she\nbowed to Lord Maythorne, and departed.\nMrs. Arundel was greatly distressed when she heard Joyce's news, and\nthey consulted together what it was best to do.\n\"After all,\" Mrs. Arundel said, \"neither you nor I have any right over\nCharlotte. If she is warned, that is all we can do. If Miss Falconer\nconsents, she is her lawful guardian, and stands in the place of her\nmother.\"",

He advises our making a move to Abbot's Leigh, to that\nhouse of Mr. Bayley's, as soon as we can arrange it, and Gilbert is able\nto bear the drive.

I am afraid I was very cantankerous this morning,\nbut that dreadful trumpet was rather too much. It is excessively stupid\nof me to be so long getting well; but, do you know, I am haunted with\nthose terrible scenes of last week, and, with the best intentions of\namusing me, Bayley came here and described the condition of Queen's\nSquare, and the charred bodies they found, one, the corpse of an old\nwoman, with a bit of red petticoat clinging to it. Ah! it is awful to\nthink of; and the cure for all this seems so far off.\"\n\"It will come at last,\" Joyce said, with quiet decision.\n\"Yes, when the whole nation wakes up to see the needs of the poor. We\ndon't help them, nor try to raise them out of their ignorance of the\ncommonest laws of humanity. We have been wholly neglectful of their\nsouls and bodies, and then when they are heated by drink, and let loose\ntheir fury against some grievance, like the entrance of the Anti-Reform\nRecorder into Bristol, we hunt them down, trample them under foot, and\nnever look below the surface to find out what is the bitter root, from\nwhich all this springs.\"\n\"_You_ look below the surface, dearest; but don't go over it all now; I\nhave a piece of news to tell you, which has made me very angry.\nCharlotte Benson says she is engaged to marry your uncle. Can anything\nbe done?\"\n\"Write at once to aunt Letitia to stop it.\"\n\"That is the most extraordinary part of the whole affair; she does not\ndisapprove it.\"\n\"She must be mad!\" said Gilbert, shortly; \"what does my mother say?\"\n\"She is afraid of exciting you about it; but she is very much\ndisturbed.\"\n\"She may well be. He must be looking after your aunt's money.\"\n\"Shall I write to Aunt Letitia?\"\n\"Yes; I only wish I were well, and not laid on the shelf like this, and\nI would go to Wells to-morrow.\"\n\"I thought of writing to Gratian and Ralph, and Harry is still at Fair\nAcres. Aunt Letitia thinks a great deal of what Gratian says.\"\n\"Better write to Aunt Letitia, and I will tell you what to say. Get my\nmother to write also, and surely you have been honest with the girl?\"\n\"Very honest indeed,\" Joyce said, laughing; \"a little too honest!\"\nThe letter was dictated and posted, with one from Mrs. Arundel. Postage\nwas an object in those days, so that the two letters went under one\ncover, carefully sealed by Gilbert's hand.\nFor some days there was silence, and no one knew what turn events had\ntaken, and there was no answer to the letters.\nA week passed, and then came a letter from Charlotte herself.",

The lowlands, sloping down to the mouth of the Severn, were\nbathed in the sunshine, and beyond, in clear outline, was the great\nencircling range of blue mountains on the opposite coast of Wales. In\nthe clear atmosphere of the winter morning, everything was distinctly\nseen. The wooded headland of Portishead shot out to the left, and was\nrounded at full tide by many ships, outward bound for the rolling waters\nof the Atlantic.\nSnowy gulls dipped and whirled on airy flight near the shore, and small\ncrafts, with all sails set, danced and curtseyed beneath them as they\nmade for the harbour.\n\"It is a place to rest and get well in,\" Gilbert thought; and then he\nturned at the sound of footsteps.\nHis wife was coming through the maze of deep-set, box-bordered\nflower-beds to speak to him.\n\"Mother and Piers will be here early,\" she said, putting her hand\nthrough her husband's arm; \"and Gratian, and Melville, and Ralph will be\nlater.\"\n\"Where are you going to put them all? You forget your country seat is\nnot as accommodating as our Great George Street house.\"\n\"Oh! I will make room,\" she said; \"it is so restful and lovely here. I\nwish----\"\n\"What do you wish?\"\n\"That we lived here. I know it is impossible while you are in the office\nevery day. I only meant it is so delightful to be in the country; winter\nor summer, it is the best place.\"\n[Illustration: Abbot's Leigh]",

Such love must make a poor man rich and a rich man happy,\nand may God bless them both. The mistress grows prettier every day.\"\nNo one ever sounded Susan Priday's depth of gratitude; she was not a\ndemonstrative person, and the other servants, as might be expected, were\na little jealous of her, and sometimes she had dark hints to bear \"of\nthe daughter of bad folks being lucky,\" and muttered words of\nself-congratulation that _their_ fathers had not been rioters and died\nin \"'ospital beds.\"\nBut all these shafts were powerless to disturb Susan's peace, and baby\nJoy heard many a soliloquy which reached no other ears than hers.\n\"Yes,\" she was saying, as she swayed Joy gently to and fro; \"they look\nlike lovers of yesterday. The master is aged since his illness, and\nstoops a bit, but the mistress is younger than ever.\"\nThe husband and wife had turned now, and faced the house. Joyce looked\nup, and waved her hand and smiled, that \"little pure, white hand,\" Susan\nthought, \"which poor father said had saved him from despair.\"\nThen the two little girls, in scarlet cloaks and hoods, came with Falcon\nto announce that they were ready for a walk with mother, and Gilbert\nasked if he might be permitted to come also.\n\"Of course,\" Falcon said; \"only we thought you might be tired. Mother\ntold us never to plague you to take us for a walk.\"\n\"I am getting quite well, my boy, and it will not be so easy, I hope, to\nplague me now as it has been lately.\"\n\"I've put away the trumpet, father, where I can't possibly see it, for I\nwas afraid if I saw it I should be forced to give a big '_too-te-too_.'\nSo mother said, put it away till father is quite well, and then you can\nblow it in the garden. She wanted to _keep_ it for me, but that was like\na baby; now I could get it any minute I wished, only I _won't_.\"\nGilbert was half amused, half touched, by this lesson of self-restraint\nthat Joyce had taught her little son, by means of the discordant\ntrumpet, and he patted his head fondly, saying:\n\"You'll always be right if you follow mother's advice, my boy.\"\n\"I know it,\" Falcon said; \"Susan says mother can make every one\n_better_.\"\nJoyce and her little daughters were on in front, walking up the village\nto the churchyard.\nPresently they retraced their steps to the village, where an old tree,\nwith a gnarled trunk, stands at the junction of four roads, and was a\nfavourite post of observation to the children.\nA smart post-chaise, seen from afar, coming swiftly onwards, contained\nMelville and Gratian. They had slept at an hotel in Clifton on the\nprevious night, and came in the style which befitted them.\nJoyce was a little alarmed at the large amount of boxes on the roof, and\nwondered if they could by any means be carried upstairs.\nGratian, handsome and gay as ever, gave all the orders and settled with\nthe post-boy, while Melville looked on.\nIt was one of those cases when it is expedient, perhaps, that the wife\nshould take the lead, from the incapacity of the husband to manage\nhimself or his affairs, but it has never a pleasing effect on those who\nlook on, and Gilbert thought how well it was there were no children to\nhear Gratian's ringing tones ordering Melville to 'wake up' and carry\ntwo small packages into the hall.\n\"Where is Ralph?\" Joyce asked.\n\"He took some qualm about leaving Fair Acres. Mr. Watson is ill--dying,\nthey say--so Ralph said he did not want to leave the place; there are\nstill many bad characters about.\"\n\"I am sorry to miss Ralph, and mother will be disappointed, especially\nas Harry has joined his ship.\"",

I always think of dear father when I stand\nhere, and poor merry, happy Bunny, swept into that surging sea.\"\n\"Yes,\" Piers said, sighing; \"the strong are taken and the weakly ones\nleft. Harry is, I suppose, half way round the world again in the\n'Persis.' There is Ralph working hard and enduring a good deal at the\nold home, while I----\"\n\"You are not unhappy, dear?\" Joyce asked, anxiously.\n\"No,\" he said; but the \"No\" was not heartily said. \"After all, we think\ntoo much of ourselves and all our little concerns. Why, Joyce, what are\nwe and this earth we live in, when compared to that great universe of\nwhich these stars, as they come out one by one, seem to bring a nightly\nmessage? What are we, to think so much of ourselves? and what are life,\nand death, and troubles, and joys, and petty disappointments? They are\nnothing--lighter than dust in the balance.\"\n\"They are something to God,\" Joyce said, reverently. \"He has told us so.\nDearest Piers, you are not losing that Faith which we used to call our\nstaff in the dear old days.\"\nPiers was silent for a moment.\n\"Joyce,\" he said, at last, \"I like to talk to you sometimes. I sit and\nread in my den, and go out and in of the sitting room and see how mother\nis getting on, and my brain gets full of cobwebs and I am impatient, and\nlong to spring up into a better and nobler life, and yet I am tied down.\nDon't you think I did not feel my miserable weakness when I heard of\nGilbert, in the thick of the rioters, saving a woman and child, and\nbravely doing his best in the face of the weakness and incompetence of\nthose about him? I felt as if I would have given something to get a hard\nthump on my head in such a cause, the cause of humanity.\"\n\"Piers, you are dull at home, I know, but you have the delightful young\ndoctor for a friend.\"\n\"Yes; but I can't sham illness to get him to come; he is a long way off.\nBut I am doing some more diagrams for his lecture on Fungi.\"\n\"I am so glad; and Piers, when Gilbert can really afford it, we are\ngoing to have a house in the country, and call it 'The Haven,' and you\nand mother shall come and live with us, and you shall help me to teach\nFalcon, and we shall be so happy.\"\n\"Ah! that is looking a long way forward, Joyce. Perhaps my haven will be\nhere, under the shadow of this old church, before then. But I feel the\nbetter already for being with you, old Joyce; you are just the same as\nyou ever were.\"\nThe brother and sister exchanged a kiss, and then, in the silence of\nperfect sympathy and affection, walked back to the house.",
