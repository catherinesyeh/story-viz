            "text": "Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had done\nnothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested. Every day at eight in\nthe morning he was brought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubach's cook--Mrs.\nGrubach was his landlady--but today she didn't come. That had never\nhappened before. K. waited a little while, looked from his pillow at the\nold woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an\ninquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and\ndisconcerted, rang the bell. There was immediately a knock at the door\nand a man entered. He had never seen the man in this house before. He\nwas slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and close-fitting,\nwith many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of\nwhich gave the impression of being very practical but without making it\nvery clear what they were actually for. \"Who are you?\" asked K., sitting\nhalf upright in his bed. The man, however, ignored the question as if\nhis arrival simply had to be accepted, and merely replied, \"You rang?\"\n\"Anna should have brought me my breakfast,\" said K. He tried to work\nout who the man actually was, first in silence, just through\nobservation and by thinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to\nbe looked at for very long. Instead he went over to the door, opened it\nslightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately\nbehind it, \"He\nwants Anna to bring him his breakfast.\" There was a little laughter in\nthe neighbouring room, it was not clear from the sound of it whether\nthere were several people laughing. The strange man could not have\nlearned anything from it that he hadn't known already, but now he said\nto K., as if making his report \"It is not possible.\" \"It would be the\nfirst time that's happened,\" said K., as he jumped out of bed and\nquickly pulled on his trousers. \"I want to see who that is in the next\nroom, and why it is that Mrs. Grubach has let me be disturbed in this\nway.\" It immediately occurred to him that he needn't have said this out\nloud, and that he must to some extent have acknowledged their authority\nby doing so, but that didn't seem important to him at the time. That, at\nleast, is how the stranger took it, as he said, \"Don't you think you'd\nbetter stay where you are?\" \"I want neither to stay here nor to be\nspoken to by you until you've introduced yourself.\" \"I meant it for your\nown good,\" said the stranger and opened the door, this time without\nbeing asked. The next room, which K. entered more slowly than he had\nintended, looked at first glance exactly the same as it had the previous\nevening. It was Mrs. Grubach's living room, over-filled with furniture,\ntablecloths, porcelain and photographs. Perhaps there was a little more\nspace in there than usual today, but if so it was not immediately\nobvious, especially as the main difference was the presence of a man\nsitting by the open window with a book from which he now looked up.\n\"You should have stayed in your room! Didn't Franz tell you?\" \"And what\nis it you want, then?\" said K., looking back and forth between this new\nacquaintance and the one named Franz, who had remained in the doorway.\nThrough the open window he noticed the old woman again, who had come\nclose to the window opposite so that she could continue to see\neverything. She was showing an inquisitiveness that really made it seem\nlike she was going senile. \"I want to see Mrs. Grubach ...,\" said K.,\nmaking a movement as if tearing himself away from the two men--even\nthough they were standing well away from him--and wanted to go. \"No,\"\nsaid the man at the window, who threw his book down on a coffee table\nand stood up. \"You can't go away when you're under arrest.\" \"That's how\nit seems,\" said K. \"And why am I under arrest?\" he then asked. \"That's\nsomething we're not allowed to tell you. Go into your room and wait\nthere. Proceedings are underway and you'll learn about everything all in\ngood time. It's not really part of my job to be friendly towards you\nlike this, but I hope no-one, apart from Franz, will hear about it, and\nhe's been more friendly towards you than he should have been, under the\nrules, himself. If you carry on having as much good luck as you have\nbeen with your arresting officers then you can reckon on things going\nwell with you.\" K. wanted to sit down, but then he saw that, apart from\nthe chair by the window, there was nowhere anywhere in the room where he\ncould sit. \"You'll get the chance to see for yourself how true all this\nis,\" said Franz and both men then walked up to K. They were\nsignificantly bigger than him, especially the second man, who frequently\nslapped him on the shoulder. The two of them felt K.'s nightshirt, and\nsaid he would now have to wear one that was of much lower quality, but\nthat they would keep the nightshirt along with his other underclothes\nand return them to him if his case turned out well. \"It's better for you\nif you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom,\" they\nsaid. \"Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after\na certain amount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved\nhas come to an end or not. And cases like this can last a long time,\nespecially the ones that have been coming up lately. They'd give you the\nmoney they got for them, but it wouldn't be very much as it's not what\nthey're offered for them when they sell them that counts, it's how much\nthey get slipped on the side, and things like that lose their value\nanyway when they get passed on from hand to hand, year after year.\" K.\npaid hardly any attention to what they were saying, he did not place\nmuch value on what he may have still possessed or on who decided what\nhappened to them. It was much more important to him to get a clear\nunderstanding of his position, but he could not think clearly while\nthese people were here, the second policeman's belly--and they could\nonly be policemen--looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but\nwhen K. looked up and saw his dry, bony face it did not seem to fit\nwith the body. His strong nose twisted to one side as if ignoring K. and\nsharing an understanding with the other policeman. What sort of people\nwere these? What were they talking about? What office did they belong\nto? K. was living in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace,\nall laws were decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in\nhis own home. He was always inclined to take life as lightly as he\ncould, to cross bridges when he came to them, pay no heed for the\nfuture, even when everything seemed under threat. But here that did not\nseem the right thing to do. He could have taken it all as a joke, a big\njoke set up by his colleagues at the bank for some unknown reason, or\nalso perhaps because today was his thirtieth birthday, it was all\npossible of course, maybe all he had to do was laugh in the policemen's\nface in some way and they would laugh with him, maybe they were\ntradesmen from the corner of the street, they looked like they might\nbe--but he was nonetheless determined, ever since he first caught sight\nof the one called Franz, not to lose any slight advantage he might have\nhad over these people. There was a very slight risk that people would\nlater say he couldn't understand a joke, but--although he wasn't\nnormally in the habit of learning from experience--he might also have\nhad a few unimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious\nfriends, he had acted with no thought at all for what might follow and\nhad been made to suffer for it. He didn't want that to happen again, not\nthis time at least; if they were play-acting he would act along with\nthem.\nHe still had time. \"Allow me,\" he said, and hurried between the two\npolicemen through into his room. \"He seems sensible enough,\" he heard\nthem say behind him. Once in his room, he quickly pulled open the drawer\nof his writing desk, everything in it was very tidy but in his\nagitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was\nlooking for straight away. He finally found his bicycle permit and was\nabout to go back to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too\npetty, so he carried on searching until he found his birth certificate.\nJust as he got back in the adjoining room the door on the other side\nopened and Mrs. Grubach was about to enter. He only saw her for an\ninstant, for as soon as she recognised K. she was clearly embarrassed,\nasked for forgiveness and disappeared, closing the door behind her very\ncarefully. \"Do come in,\" K. could have said just then. But now he stood\nin the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking\nat the door which did not open again. He stayed like that until he was\nstartled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little\ntable at the open window and, as K. now saw, was eating his breakfast.\n\"Why didn't she come in?\" he asked. \"She's not allowed to,\" said the\nbig policeman. \"You're under arrest, aren't you?\" \"But how can I be\nunder arrest? And how come it's like this?\" \"Now you're starting again,\"\nsaid the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the honeypot.\n\"We don't answer questions like that.\" \"You will have to answer them,\"\nsaid K. \"Here are my identification papers, now show me yours and I\ncertainly want to see the arrest warrant.\" \"Oh, my God!\" said the\npoliceman. \"In a position like yours, and you think you can start giving\norders, do you. It won't do you any good to get us on the wrong side,\neven if you think it will--we're probably more on your side that anyone\nelse you know!\" \"That's true, you know, you'd better believe it,\" said\nFranz, holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he did not lift to his\nmouth but looked at K. in a way that was probably meant to be full of\nmeaning but could not actually be understood. K. found himself, without\nintending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but then slapped his hand\ndown on his papers and said, \"Here are my identity documents.\" \"And what\ndo you want us to do about it?\" replied the big policeman, loudly. \"The\nway you're carrying on, it's worse than a child. What is it you want? Do\nyou want to get this great, bloody trial of yours over with quickly by\ntalking about ID and arrest warrants with us? We're just coppers, that's\nall we are. Junior officers like us hardly know one end of an ID card\nfrom another, all we've got to do with you is keep an eye on you for\nten hours a day and get paid for it. That's all we are. Mind you, what\nwe can do is make sure that the high officials we work for find out\njust what sort of person it is they're going to arrest, and why he\nshould be arrested, before they issue the warrant. There's no mistake\nthere. Our authorities as far as I know, and I only know the lowest\ngrades, don't go out looking for guilt among the public; it's the guilt\nthat draws them out, like it says in the law, and they have to send us\npolice officers out. That's the law. Where d'you think there'd be any\nmistake there?\" \"I don't know this law,\" said K. \"So much the worse for\nyou, then,\" said the policeman. \"It's probably exists only in your\nheads,\" said K., he wanted, in some way, to insinuate his way into the\nthoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those thoughts to his benefit or\nto make himself at home there. But the policeman just said dismissively,\n\"You'll find out when it affects you.\" Franz joined in, and said, \"Look\nat this, Willem, he admits he doesn't know the law and at the same time\ninsists he's innocent.\" \"You're quite right, but we can't get him to\nunderstand a thing,\" said the other. K. stopped talking with them; do I,\nhe thought to himself, do I really have to carry on getting tangled up\nwith the chattering of base functionaries like this?--and they admit\nthemselves that they are of the lowest position. They're talking about\nthings of which they don't have the slightest understanding, anyway.\nIt's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of\nthemselves. I just need few words with someone of the same social\nstanding as myself and everything will be incomparably clearer, much\nclearer than a long conversation with these two can make it. He walked\nup and down the free space in the room a couple of times, across the\nstreet he could see the old woman who, now, had pulled an old man, much\nolder than herself, up to the window and had her arms around him. K. had\nto put an end to this display, \"Take me to your superior,\" he said. \"As\nsoon as he wants to see you. Not before,\" said the policeman, the one\ncalled Willem. \"And now my advice to you,\" he added, \"is to go into your\nroom, stay calm, and wait and see what's to be done with you. If you\ntake our advice, you won't tire yourself out thinking about things to no\npurpose, you need to pull yourself together as there's a lot that's\ngoing to required of you. You've not behaved towards us the way we\ndeserve after being so good to you, you forget that we, whatever we are,\nwe're still free men and you're not, and that's quite an advantage. But\nin spite of all that we're still willing, if you've got the money, to go\nand get you some breakfast from the caf\u00e9 over the road.\"\nWithout giving any answer to this offer, K. stood still for some time.\nPerhaps, if he opened the door of the next room or even the front door,\nthe two of them would not dare to stand in his way, perhaps that would\nbe the simplest way to settle the whole thing, by bringing it to a head.\nBut maybe they would grab him, and if he were thrown down on the ground\nhe would lose all the advantage he, in a certain respect, had over them.\nSo he decided on the more certain solution, the way things would go in\nthe natural course of events, and went back in his room without another\nword either from him or from the policemen.",

            "text": "He threw himself down on his bed, and from the dressing table he took\nthe nice apple that he had put there the previous evening for his\nbreakfast. Now it was all the breakfast he had and anyway, as he\nconfirmed as soon as he took his first, big bite of it, it was far\nbetter than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the\npolicemen from the dirty caf\u00e9. He felt well and confident, he had failed\nto go into work at the bank this morning but that could easily be\nexcused because of the relatively high position he held there. Should he\nreally send in his explanation? He wondered about it. If nobody believed\nhim, and in this case that would be understandable, he could bring Mrs.\nGrubach in as a witness, or even the old pair from across the street,\nwho probably even now were on their way over to the window opposite. It\npuzzled K., at least it puzzled him looking at it from the policemen's\npoint of view, that they had made him go into the room and left him\nalone there, where he had ten different ways of killing himself. At the\nsame time, though, he asked himself, this time looking at it from his\nown point of view, what reason he could have to do so. Because those two\nwere sitting there in the next room and had taken his breakfast,\nperhaps. It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if\nhe had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable. Maybe,\nif the policemen had not been so obviously limited in their mental\nabilities, it could have been supposed that they had come to the same\nconclusion and saw no danger in leaving him alone because of it. They\ncould watch now, if they wanted, and see how he went over to the\ncupboard in the wall where he kept a bottle of good schnapps, how he\nfirst emptied a glass of it in place of his breakfast and how he then\ntook a second glassful in order to give himself courage, the last one\njust as a precaution for the unlikely chance it would be needed.\nThen he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that he\nstruck his teeth against the glass. \"The supervisor wants to see you!\" a\nvoice said. It was only the shout that startled him, this curt, abrupt,\nmilitary shout, that he would not have expected from the policeman\ncalled Franz. In itself, he found the order very welcome. \"At last!\" he\ncalled back, locked the cupboard and, without delay, hurried into the\nnext room. The two policemen were standing there and chased him back\ninto his bedroom as if that were a matter of course. \"What d'you think\nyou're doing?\" they cried. \"Think you're going to see the supervisor\ndressed in just your shirt, do you? He'd see to it you got a right\nthumping, and us and all!\" \"Let go of me for God's sake!\" called K., who\nhad already been pushed back as far as his wardrobe, \"if you accost me\nwhen I'm still in bed you can't expect to find me in my evening dress.\"\n\"That won't help you,\" said the policemen, who always became very quiet,\nalmost sad, when K. began to shout, and in that way confused him or, to\nsome extent, brought him to his senses. \"Ridiculous formalities!\" he\ngrumbled, as he lifted his coat from the chair and kept it in both his\nhands for a little while, as if holding it out for the policemen's\ninspection. They shook their heads. \"It's got to be a black coat,\"\nthey said. At that, K. threw the coat to the floor and said--without\nknowing even himself what he meant by it--\"Well it's not going to be the\nmain trial, after all.\" The policemen laughed, but continued to insist,\n\"It's got to be a black coat.\" \"Well that's alright by me if it makes\nthings go any faster,\" said K. He opened the wardrobe himself, spent a\nlong time searching through all the clothes, and chose his best black\nsuit which had a short jacket that had greatly surprised those who knew\nhim, then he also pulled out a fresh shirt and began, carefully, to get\ndressed. He secretly told himself that he had succeeded in speeding\nthings up by letting the policemen forget to make him have a bath. He\nwatched them to see if they might remember after all, but of course it\nnever occurred to them, although Willem did not forget to send Franz up\nto the supervisor with the message saying that K. was getting dressed.\nOnce he was properly dressed, K. had to pass by Willem as he went\nthrough the next room into the one beyond, the door of which was already\nwide open. K. knew very well that this room had recently been let to a\ntypist called 'Miss B\u00fcrstner'. She was in the habit of going out to work\nvery early and coming back home very late, and K. had never exchanged\nmore than a few words of greeting with her. Now, her bedside table had\nbeen pulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk for these\nproceedings, and the supervisor sat behind it. He had his legs crossed,\nand had thrown one arm over the backrest of the chair.\nIn one corner of the room there were three young people looking at the\nphotographs belonging to Miss B\u00fcrstner that had been put into a piece of\nfabric on the wall. Hung up on the handle of the open window was a white\nblouse. At the window across the street, there was the old pair again,\nalthough now their number had increased, as behind them, and far taller\nthan they were, stood a man with an open shirt that showed his chest and\na reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with his fingers.\n\"Josef K.?\" asked the supervisor, perhaps merely to attract K.'s\nattention as he looked round the room. K. nodded. \"I daresay you were\nquite surprised by all that's been taking place this morning,\" said the\nsupervisor as, with both hands, he pushed away the few items on the\nbedside table--the candle and box of matches, a book and a pin cushion\nwhich lay there as if they were things he would need for his own\nbusiness. \"Certainly,\" said K., and he began to feel relaxed now that,\nat last, he stood in front of someone with some sense, someone with whom\nhe would be able to talk about his situation. \"Certainly I'm surprised,\nbut I'm not in any way very surprised.\" \"You're not very surprised?\"\nasked the supervisor, as he positioned the candle in the middle of the\ntable and the other things in a group around it. \"Perhaps you don't\nquite understand me,\" K. hurriedly pointed out. \"What I mean is ...\"\nhere K. broke off what he was saying and looked round for somewhere to\nsit. \"I may sit down, mayn't I?\" he asked. \"That's not usual,\" the\nsupervisor answered. \"What I mean is ...,\" said K. without delaying a\nsecond time, \"that, yes, I am very surprised but when you've been in the\nworld for thirty years already and had to make your own way through\neverything yourself, which has been my lot, then you become hardened to\nsurprises and don't take them too hard. Especially not what's happened\ntoday.\" \"Why especially not what's happened today?\" \"I wouldn't want to\nsay that I see all of this as a joke, you seem to have gone to too much\ntrouble making all these arrangements for that. Everyone in the house\nmust be taking part in it as well as all of you, that would be going\nbeyond what could be a joke. So I don't want to say that this is a\njoke.\" \"Quite right,\" said the supervisor, looking to see how many\nmatches were left in the box. \"But on the other hand,\" K. went on,\nlooking round at everyone there and even wishing he could get the\nattention of the three who were looking at the photographs, \"on the\nother hand this really can't be all that important. That follows from\nthe fact that I've been indicted, but can't think of the slightest\noffence for which I could be indicted. But even that is all beside the\npoint, the main question is: Who is issuing the indictment? What office\nis conducting this affair? Are you officials? None of you is wearing a\nuniform, unless what you are wearing\"--here he turned towards Franz--\"is\nmeant to be a uniform, it's actually more of a travelling suit. I\nrequire a clear answer to all these questions, and I'm quite sure that\nonce things have been made clear we can take our leave of each other on\nthe best of terms.\" The supervisor slammed the box of matches down on\nthe table. \"You're making a big mistake,\" he said. \"These gentlemen and\nI have got nothing to do with your business, in fact we know almost\nnothing about you. We could be wearing uniforms as proper and exact as\nyou like and your situation wouldn't be any the worse for it. As to\nwhether you're on a charge, I can't give you any sort of clear answer to\nthat, I don't even know whether you are or not. You're under arrest,\nyou're quite right about that, but I don't know any more than that.\nMaybe these officers have been chit-chatting with you, well if they have\nthat's all it is, chit-chat. I can't give you an answer to your\nquestions, but I can give you a bit of advice: You'd better think less\nabout us and what's going to happen to you, and think a bit more about\nyourself. And stop making all this fuss about your sense of innocence;\nyou don't make such a bad impression, but with all this fuss you're\ndamaging it. And you ought to do a bit less talking, too. Almost\neverything you've said so far has been things we could have taken from\nyour behaviour, even if you'd said no more than a few words. And what\nyou have said has not exactly been in your favour.\"\nK. stared at the supervisor. Was this man, probably younger than he was,\nlecturing him like a schoolmaster. Was he being punished for his honesty\nwith a telling off. And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for\nhis arrest or those who were arresting him. He became somewhat cross and\nbegan to walk up and down. No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed\nhis sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair, went over to\nthe three men, said, \"It makes no sense,\" at which these three turned\nround to face him and came towards him with serious expressions. He\nfinally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk. \"State\nAttorney Hasterer is a good friend of mine,\" he said, \"can I telephone\nhim?\" \"Certainly,\" said the supervisor, \"but I don't know what the point\nof that will be, I suppose you must have some private matter you want to\ndiscuss with him.\" \"What the point is?\" shouted K., more disconcerted\nthat cross. \"Who do you think you are? You want to see some point in it\nwhile you're carrying out something as pointless as it could be. It's\nenough to make you cry! These gentlemen first accost me, and now they\nsit or stand about in here and let me be hauled up in front of you.\nWhat point there would be, in telephoning a state attorney when I'm\nostensibly under arrest? Very well, I won't make the telephone call.\"\n\"You can call him if you want to,\" said the supervisor, stretching his\nhand out towards the outer room where the telephone was, \"please, go on,\ndo make your phone call.\" \"No, I don't want to any more,\" said K., and\nwent over to the window. Across the street, the people were still there\nat the window, and it was only now that K. had gone up to his window\nthat they seemed to become uneasy about quietly watching what was going\non. The old couple wanted to get up but the man behind them calmed them\ndown. \"We've got some kind of audience over there,\" called K. to the\nsupervisor, quite loudly, as he pointed out with his forefinger. \"Go\naway,\" he then called across to them. And the three of them did\nimmediately retreat a few steps, the old pair even found themselves\nbehind the man who then concealed them with the breadth of his body and\nseemed, going by the movements of his mouth, to be saying something\nincomprehensible into the distance. They did not disappear entirely,\nthough, but seemed to be waiting for the moment when they could come\nback to the window without being noticed. \"Intrusive, thoughtless\npeople!\" said K. as he turned back into the room. The supervisor may\nhave agreed with him, at least K. thought that was what he saw from the\ncorner of his eye. But it was just as possible that he had not even been\nlistening as he had his hand pressed firmly down on the table and seemed\nto be comparing the length of his fingers. The two policemen were\nsitting on a chest covered with a coloured blanket, rubbing their knees.\nThe three young people had put their hands on their hips and were\nlooking round aimlessly. Everything was still, like in some office that\nhas been forgotten about. \"Now, gentlemen,\" called out K., and for a\nmoment it seemed as if he was carrying all of them on his shoulders, \"it\nlooks like your business with me is over with. In my opinion, it's best\nnow to stop wondering about whether you're proceeding correctly or\nincorrectly, and to bring the matter to a peaceful close with a mutual\nhandshake. If you are of the same opinion, then please....\" and he\nwalked up to the supervisor's desk and held out his hand to him. The\nsupervisor raised his eyes, bit his lip and looked at K.'s outstretched\nhand; K. still believed the supervisor would do as he suggested. But\ninstead, he stood up, picked up a hard round hat that was laying on\nMiss B\u00fcrstner's bed and put it carefully onto his head, using both hands\nas if trying on a new hat. \"Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't\nit,\" he said to K. as he did so, \"so you think we should bring the\nmatter to a peaceful close, do you? No, no, that won't do. Mind you, on\nthe other hand I certainly wouldn't want you to think there's no hope\nfor you. No, why should you think that? You're simply under arrest,\nnothing more than that. That's what I had to tell you, that's what I've\ndone and now I've seen how you've taken it. That's enough for one day\nand we can take our leave of each other, for the time being at least. I\nexpect you'll want to go in to the bank now, won't you?\" \"In to the\nbank?\" asked K., \"I thought I was under arrest.\" K. said this with a\ncertain amount of defiance as, although his handshake had not been\naccepted, he was feeling more independent of all these people,\nespecially since the supervisor had stood up. He was playing with them.\nIf they left, he had decided he would run after them and offer to let\nthem arrest him. That's why he even repeated, \"How can I go in to the\nbank when I'm under arrest?\" \"I see you've misunderstood me,\" said the\nsupervisor who was already at the door. \"It's true that you're under\narrest, but that shouldn't stop you from carrying out your job. And\nthere shouldn't be anything to stop you carrying on with your usual\nlife.\" \"In that case it's not too bad, being under arrest,\" said K., and\nwent up close to the supervisor. \"I never meant it should be anything\nelse,\" he replied. \"It hardly seems to have been necessary to notify me\nof the arrest in that case,\" said K., and went even closer. The others\nhad also come closer. All of them had gathered together into a narrow\nspace by the door. \"That was my duty,\" said the supervisor. \"A silly\nduty,\" said K., unyielding. \"Maybe so,\" replied the supervisor, \"only\ndon't let's waste our time talking on like this. I had assumed you'd be\nwanting to go to the bank. As you're paying close attention to every\nword I'll add this: I'm not forcing you to go to the bank, I'd just\nassumed you wanted to. And to make things easier for you, and to let you\nget to the bank with as little fuss as possible I've put these three\ngentlemen, colleagues of yours, at your disposal.\" \"What's that?\"\nexclaimed K., and looked at the three in astonishment. He could only\nremember seeing them in their group by the photographs, but these\ncharacterless, anaemic young people were indeed officials from his bank,\nnot colleagues of his, that was putting it too high and it showed a gap\nin the omniscience of the supervisor, but they were nonetheless junior\nmembers of staff at the bank. How could K. have failed to see that? How\noccupied he must have been with the supervisor and the policemen not to\nhave recognised these three! Rabensteiner, with his stiff demeanour and\nswinging hands, Kullich, with his blonde hair and deep-set eyes, and\nKaminer, with his involuntary grin caused by chronic muscle spasms.\n\"Good morning,\" said K. after a while, extending his hand to the\ngentlemen as they bowed correctly to him. \"I didn't recognise you at\nall. So, we'll go into work now, shall we?\" The gentlemen laughed and\nnodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they had been waiting for\nall the time, except that K. had left his hat in his room so they all\ndashed, one after another, into the room to fetch it, which caused a\ncertain amount of embarrassment. K. stood where he was and watched them\nthrough the open double doorway, the last to go, of course, was the\napathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no more than an elegant trot.\nKaminer got to the hat and K., as he often had to do at the bank,\nforcibly reminded himself that the grin was not deliberate, that he in\nfact wasn't able to grin deliberately. At that moment Mrs. Grubach\nopened the door from the hallway into the living room where all the\npeople were. She did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all, and",

            "text": "K., as often before, looked down at the belt of her apron which, for no\nreason, cut so deeply into her hefty body. Once downstairs, K., with his\nwatch in his hand, decided to take a taxi--he had already been delayed\nby half an hour and there was no need to make the delay any longer.\nKaminer ran to the corner to summon it, and the two others were making\nobvious efforts to keep K. diverted when Kullich pointed to the doorway\nof the house on the other side of the street where the large man with\nthe blonde goatee beard appeared and, a little embarrassed at first at\nletting himself be seen in his full height, stepped back to the wall and\nleant against it. The old couple were probably still on the stairs. K.\nwas cross with Kullich for pointing out this man whom he had already\nseen himself, in fact whom he had been expecting. \"Don't look at him!\"\nhe snapped, without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in this\nway. But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi\narrived, they sat inside and set off. Inside the taxi, K. remembered\nthat he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving--the\nsupervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the\nthree bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor. This showed\nthat K. was not very attentive, and he resolved to watch himself more\ncarefully in this respect. Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as he\ntwisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to\ncatch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could. But he\nturned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of\nthe taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone. Although it\ndid not seem like it, now was just the time when he needed some\nencouragement, but the gentlemen seemed tired just then, Rabensteiner\nlooked out of the car to the right, Kullich to the left and only Kaminer\nwas there with his grin at K.'s service. It would have been inhumane to\nmake fun of that.\nThat spring, whenever possible, K. usually spent his evenings after\nwork--he usually stayed in the office until nine o'clock--with a short\nwalk, either by himself or in the company of some of the bank officials,\nand then he would go into a pub where he would sit at the regulars'\ntable with mostly older men until eleven. There were, however, also\nexceptions to this habit, times, for instance, when K. was invited by\nthe bank's manager (whom he greatly respected for his industry and\ntrustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or to eat dinner\nwith him at his large house. K. would also go, once a week, to see a\ngirl called Elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar through the\nnight until late in the morning. During the daytime she only received\nvisitors while still in bed.\nThat evening, though,--the day had passed quickly with a lot of hard\nwork and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings--K. wanted to\ngo straight home. Each time he had any small break from the day's work\nhe considered, without knowing exactly what he had in mind, that Mrs.\nGrubach's flat seemed to have been put into great disarray by the events\nof that morning, and that it was up to him to put it back into order.\nOnce order had been restored, every trace of those events would have\nbeen erased and everything would take its previous course once more. In\nparticular, there was nothing to fear from the three bank officials,\nthey had immersed themselves back into their paperwork and there was no\nalteration to be seen in them. K. had called each of them, separately or\nall together, into his office that day for no other reason than to\nobserve them; he was always satisfied and had always been able to let\nthem go again.\nAt half past nine that evening, when he arrived back in front of the\nbuilding where he lived, he met a young lad in the doorway who was\nstanding there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe. \"Who are you?\"\nimmediately asked K., bringing his face close to the lad's, as it was\nhard to see in the half light of the landing. \"I'm the landlord's son,\nsir,\" answered the lad, taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping to\none side. \"The landlord's son?\" asked K., and impatiently knocked on the\nground with his stick. \"Did you want anything, sir? Would you like me\nto fetch my father?\" \"No, no,\" said K., there was something forgiving\nin his voice, as if the boy had harmed him in some way and he was\nexcusing him. \"It's alright,\" he said then, and went on, but before\ngoing up the stairs he turned round once more.\nHe could have gone directly to his room, but as he wanted to speak with\nMrs. Grubach he went straight to her door and knocked. She was sat at\nthe table with a knitted stocking and a pile of old stockings in front\nof her. K. apologised, a little embarrassed at coming so late, but Mrs.\nGrubach was very friendly and did not want to hear any apology, she was\nalways ready to speak to him, he knew very well that he was her best and\nher favourite tenant. K. looked round the room, it looked exactly as it\nusually did, the breakfast dishes, which had been on the table by the\nwindow that morning, had already been cleared away. \"A woman's hands\nwill do many things when no-one's looking,\" he thought, he might himself\nhave smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly would not have\nbeen able to carry it all out. He looked at Mrs. Grubach with some\ngratitude. \"Why are you working so late?\" he asked. They were now both\nsitting at the table, and K. now and then sank his hands into the pile\nof stockings. \"There's a lot of work to do,\" she said, \"during the day I\nbelong to the tenants; if I'm to sort out my own things there are only\nthe evenings left to me.\" \"I fear I may have caused you some exceptional\nwork today.\" \"How do you mean, Mr. K.?\" she asked, becoming more\ninterested and leaving her work in her lap. \"I mean the men who were\nhere this morning.\" \"Oh, I see,\" she said, and went peacefully back to\nwhat she was doing, \"that was no trouble, not especially.\" K. looked on\nin silence as she took up the knitted stocking once more. She seems\nsurprised at my mentioning it, he thought, she seems to think it's\nimproper for me to mention it. All the more important for me to do so.\nAn old woman is the only person I can speak about it with. \"But it must\nhave caused some work for you,\" he said then, \"but it won't happen\nagain.\" \"No, it can't happen again,\" she agreed, and smiled at K. in a\nway that was almost pained. \"Do you mean that seriously?\" asked K.\n\"Yes,\" she said, more gently, \"but the important thing is you mustn't\ntake it too hard. There are so many awful things happening in the world!\nAs you're being so honest with me, Mr. K., I can admit to you that I\nlistened to a little of what was going on from behind the door, and that\nthose two policemen told me one or two things as well. It's all to do\nwith your happiness, and that's something that's quite close to my\nheart, perhaps more than it should be as I am, after all, only your\nlandlady. Anyway, so I heard one or two things but I can't really say\nthat it's about anything very serious. No. You have been arrested, but\nit's not in the same way as when they arrest a thief. If you're arrested\nin the same way as a thief, then it's bad, but an arrest like this....\nIt seems to me that it's something very complicated--forgive me if I'm\nsaying something stupid--something very complicated that I don't\nunderstand, but something that you don't really need to understand\nanyway.\"\n\"There's nothing stupid about what you've said, Mrs. Grubach, or at\nleast I partly agree with you, only, the way I judge the whole thing is\nharsher than yours, and think it's not only not something complicated\nbut simply a fuss about nothing. I was just caught unawares, that's what\nhappened. If I had got up as soon as I was awake without letting myself\nget confused because Anna wasn't there, if I'd got up and paid no regard\nto anyone who might have been in my way and come straight to you, if I'd\ndone something like having my breakfast in the kitchen as an exception,\nasked you to bring my clothes from my room, in short, if I had behaved\nsensibly then nothing more would have happened, everything that was\nwaiting to happen would have been stifled. People are so often\nunprepared. In the bank, for example, I am well prepared, nothing of\nthis sort could possibly happen to me there, I have my own assistant\nthere, there are telephones for internal and external calls in front of\nme on the desk, I continually receive visits from people,\nrepresentatives, officials, but besides that, and most importantly, I'm\nalways occupied with my work, that's to say I'm always alert, it would\neven be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of that\nsort. But now it's over with, and I didn't really even want to talk\nabout it any more, only I wanted to hear what you, as a sensible woman,\nthought about it all, and I'm very glad to hear that we're in agreement.\nBut now you must give me your hand, an agreement of this sort needs to\nbe confirmed with a handshake.\"\nWill she shake hands with me? The supervisor didn't shake hands, he\nthought, and looked at the woman differently from before, examining her.\nShe stood up, as he had also stood up, and was a little self-conscious,\nshe hadn't been able to understand everything that K. said. As a result\nof this self-consciousness she said something that she certainly did\nnot intend and certainly was not appropriate. \"Don't take it so hard,\nMr. K.,\" she said, with tears in her voice and also, of course,\nforgetting the handshake. \"I didn't know I was taking it hard,\" said K.,\nfeeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree with him\nit was of very little value.\nBefore going out the door he asked, \"Is Miss B\u00fcrstner home?\" \"No,\" said\nMrs. Grubach, smiling as she gave this simple piece of information,\nsaying something sensible at last. \"She's at the theatre. Did you want\nto see her? Should I give her a message?\" \"I, er, I just wanted to have\na few words with her.\" \"I'm afraid I don't know when she's coming in;\nshe usually gets back late when she's been to the theatre.\" \"It really\ndoesn't matter,\" said K. his head hanging as he turned to the door to\nleave, \"I just wanted to give her my apology for taking over her room\ntoday.\" \"There's no need for that, Mr. K., you're too conscientious, the\nyoung lady doesn't know anything about it, she hasn't been home since\nearly this morning and everything's been tidied up again, you can see\nfor yourself.\" And she opened the door to Miss B\u00fcrstner's room. \"Thank\nyou, I'll take your word for it,\" said K., but went nonetheless over to\nthe open door. The moon shone quietly into the unlit room. As far as\ncould be seen, everything was indeed in its place, not even the blouse\nwas hanging on the window handle. The pillows on the bed looked\nremarkably plump as they lay half in the moonlight. \"Miss B\u00fcrstner often\ncomes home late,\" said K., looking at Mrs. Grubach as if that were her\nresponsibility. \"That's how young people are!\" said Mrs. Grubach to\nexcuse herself. \"Of course, of course,\" said K., \"but it can be taken\ntoo far.\" \"Yes, it can be,\" said Mrs. Grubach, \"you're so right, Mr. K.\nPerhaps it is in this case. I certainly wouldn't want to say anything\nnasty about Miss B\u00fcrstner, she is a good, sweet girl, friendly, tidy,\npunctual, works hard, I appreciate all that very much, but one thing is\ntrue, she ought to have more pride, be a bit less forthcoming. Twice\nthis month already, in the street over the way, I've seen her with a\ndifferent gentleman. I really don't like saying this, you're the only\none I've said this to, Mr. K., I swear to God, but I'm going to have no\nchoice but to have a few words with Miss B\u00fcrstner about it myself. And\nit's not the only thing about her that I'm worried about.\" \"Mrs.\nGrubach, you are on quite the wrong track,\" said K., so angry that he\nwas hardly able to hide it, \"and you have moreover misunderstood what I\nwas saying about Miss B\u00fcrstner, that is not what I meant. In fact I warn\nyou quite directly not to say anything to her, you are quite mistaken, I\nknow Miss B\u00fcrstner very well and there is no truth at all in what you\nsay. And what's more, perhaps I'm going to far, I don't want to get in\nyour way, say to her whatever you see fit. Good night.\" \"Mr. K.,\" said\nMrs. Grubach as if asking him for something and hurrying to his door\nwhich he had already opened, \"I don't want to speak to Miss B\u00fcrstner at\nall, not yet, of course I'll continue to keep an eye on her but you're\nthe only one I've told what I know. And it is, after all something that\neveryone who lets rooms has to do if she's to keep the house decent,\nthat's all I'm trying to do.\" \"Decent!\" called out K. through the crack\nin the door, \"if you want to keep the house decent you'll first have to\ngive me notice.\" Then he slammed the door shut, there was a gentle\nknocking to which he paid no more attention.",

            "text": "He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay up, and\nthis would also give him the chance to find out when Miss B\u00fcrstner would\narrive home. Perhaps it would also still be possible, even if a little\ninappropriate, to have a few words with her. As he lay there by the\nwindow, pressing his hands to his tired eyes, he even thought for a\nmoment that he might punish Mrs. Grubach by persuading Miss B\u00fcrstner to\ngive in her notice at the same time as he would. But he immediately\nrealised that that would be shockingly excessive, and there would even\nbe the suspicion that he was moving house because of the incidents of\nthat morning. Nothing would have been more nonsensical and, above all,\nmore pointless and contemptible.\nWhen he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street he\nslightly opened the door to the living room so that he could see anyone\nwho entered the flat from where he was and lay down on the couch. He lay\nthere, quietly smoking a cigar, until about eleven o'clock. He wasn't\nable to hold out longer than that, and went a little way into the\nhallway as if in that way he could make Miss B\u00fcrstner arrive sooner. He\nhad no particular desire for her, he could not even remember what she\nlooked like, but now he wanted to speak to her and it irritated him that\nher late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease and\ndisorder right to its very end. It was also her fault that he had not\nhad any dinner that evening and that he had been unable to visit Elsa\nas he had intended. He could still make up for both of those things,\nthough, if he went to the wine bar where Elsa worked. He wanted to do so\neven later, after the discussion with Miss B\u00fcrstner.\nIt was already gone half past eleven when someone could be heard in the\nstairway. K., who had been lost in his thoughts in the hallway, walking\nup and down loudly as if it were his own room, fled behind his door.\nMiss B\u00fcrstner had arrived. Shivering, she pulled a silk shawl over her\nslender shoulders as she locked the door. The next moment she would\ncertainly go into her room, where K. ought not to intrude in the middle\nof the night; that meant he would have to speak to her now, but,\nunfortunately, he had not put the electric light on in his room so that\nwhen he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being an\nattack and would certainly, at the very least, have been quite alarming.\nThere was no time to lose, and in his helplessness he whispered through\nthe crack of the door, \"Miss B\u00fcrstner.\" It sounded like he was pleading\nwith her, not calling to her. \"Is there someone there?\" asked Miss\nB\u00fcrstner, looking round with her eyes wide open. \"It's me,\" said K. and\ncame out. \"Oh, Mr. K.!\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner with a smile. \"Good Evening,\"\nand offered him her hand. \"I wanted to have a word with you, if you\nwould allow me?\" \"Now?\" asked Miss B\u00fcrstner, \"does it have to be now? It\nis a little odd, isn't it?\" \"I've been waiting for you since nine\no'clock.\" \"Well, I was at the theatre, I didn't know anything about you\nwaiting for me.\" \"The reason I need to speak to you only came up\ntoday.\" \"I see, well I don't see why not, I suppose, apart from being\nso tired I could drop. Come into my room for a few minutes then. We\ncertainly can't talk out here, we'd wake everyone up and I think that\nwould be more unpleasant for us than for them. Wait here till I've put\nthe light on in my room, and then turn the light down out here.\" K. did\nas he was told, and then even waited until Miss B\u00fcrstner came out of her\nroom and quietly invited him, once more, to come in. \"Sit down,\" she\nsaid, indicating the ottoman, while she herself remained standing by\nthe bedpost despite the tiredness she had spoken of; she did not even\ntake off her hat, which was small but decorated with an abundance of\nflowers. \"What is it you wanted, then? I'm really quite curious.\" She\ngently crossed her legs. \"I expect you'll say,\" K. began, \"that the\nmatter really isn't all that urgent and we don't need to talk about it\nright now, but....\" \"I never listen to introductions,\" said Miss\nB\u00fcrstner. \"That makes my job so much easier,\" said K. \"This morning, to\nsome extent through my fault, your room was made a little untidy, this\nhappened because of people I did not know and against my will but, as I\nsaid, because of my fault; I wanted to apologise for it.\" \"My room?\"\nasked Miss B\u00fcrstner, and instead of looking round the room scrutinised\nK. \"It is true,\" said K., and now, for the first time, they looked each\nother in the eyes, \"there's no point in saying exactly how this came\nabout.\" \"But that's the interesting thing about it,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner.\n\"No,\" said K. \"Well then,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner, \"I don't want to force my\nway into any secrets, if you insist that it's of no interest I won't\ninsist. I'm quite happy to forgive you for it, as you ask, especially as\nI can't see anything at all that's been left untidy.\" With her hand laid\nflat on her lower hip, she made a tour around the room. At the mat where\nthe photographs were she stopped. \"Look at this!\" she cried. \"My\nphotographs really have been put in the wrong places. Oh, that's\nhorrible. Someone really has been in my room without permission.\" K.\nnodded, and quietly cursed Kaminer who worked at his bank and who was\nalways active doing things that had neither use nor purpose. \"It is\nodd,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner, \"that I'm forced to forbid you to do something\nthat you ought to have forbidden yourself to do, namely to come into my\nroom when I'm not here.\" \"But I did explain to you,\" said K., and went\nover to join her by the photographs, \"that it wasn't me who interfered\nwith your photographs; but as you don't believe me I'll have to admit\nthat the investigating committee brought along three bank employees with\nthem, one of them must have touched your photographs and as soon as I\nget the chance I'll ask to have him dismissed from the bank. Yes, there\nwas an investigating committee here,\" added K., as the young lady was\nlooking at him enquiringly. \"Because of you?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" answered\nK. \"No!\" the lady cried with a laugh. \"Yes, they were,\" said K., \"you\nbelieve that I'm innocent then, do you?\" \"Well now, innocent ...\" said\nthe lady, \"I don't want to start making any pronouncements that might\nhave serious consequences, I don't really know you after all, it means\nthey're dealing with a serious criminal if they send an investigating\ncommittee straight out to get him. But you're not in custody now--at\nleast I take it you've not escaped from prison considering that you seem\nquite calm--so you can't have committed any crime of that sort.\" \"Yes,\"\nsaid K., \"but it might be that the investigating committee could see\nthat I'm innocent, or not so guilty as had been supposed.\" \"Yes, that's\ncertainly a possibility,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner, who seemed very\ninterested. \"Listen,\" said K., \"you don't have much experience in legal\nmatters.\" \"No, that's true, I don't,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner, \"and I've\noften regretted it, as I'd like to know everything and I'm very\ninterested in legal matters. There's something peculiarly attractive\nabout the law, isn't there. But I'll certainly be perfecting my\nknowledge in this area, as next month I start work in a legal office.\"\n\"That's very good,\" said K., \"that means you'll be able to give me some\nhelp with my trial.\" \"That could well be,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner, \"why not?\nI like to make use of what I know.\" \"I mean it quite seriously,\" said\nK., \"or at least, half seriously, as you do. This affair is too petty to\ncall in a lawyer, but I could make good use of someone who could give me\nadvice.\" \"Yes, but if I'm to give you advice I'll have to know what it's\nall about,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner. \"That's exactly the problem,\" said K.,\n\"I don't know that myself.\" \"So you have been making fun of me, then,\"\nsaid Miss B\u00fcrstner exceedingly disappointed, \"you really ought not to\ntry something like that on at this time of night.\" And she stepped away\nfrom the photographs where they had stood so long together. \"Miss\nB\u00fcrstner, no,\" said K., \"I'm not making fun of you. Please believe me!\nI've already told you everything I know. More than I know, in fact, as\nit actually wasn't even an investigating committee, that's just what I\ncalled them because I don't know what else to call them. There was no\ncross questioning at all, I was merely arrested, but by a committee.\"\nMiss B\u00fcrstner sat on the ottoman and laughed again. \"What was it like\nthen?\" she asked. \"It was terrible,\" said K., although his mind was no\nlonger on the subject, he had become totally absorbed by Miss B\u00fcrstner's\ngaze who was supporting her chin on one hand--the elbow rested on the\ncushion of the ottoman--and slowly stroking her hip with the other.\n\"That's too vague,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner. \"What's too vague?\" asked K.\nThen he remembered himself and asked, \"Would you like me to show you\nwhat it was like?\" He wanted to move in some way but did not want to\nleave. \"I'm already tired,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner. \"You arrived back so\nlate,\" said K. \"Now you've started telling me off. Well I suppose I\ndeserve it as I shouldn't have let you in here in the first place, and\nit turns out there wasn't even any point.\" \"Oh, there was a point,\nyou'll see now how important a point it was,\" said K. \"May I move this\ntable away from your bedside and put it here?\" \"What do you think you're\ndoing?\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner. \"Of course you can't!\" \"In that case I\ncan't show you,\" said K., quite upset, as if Miss B\u00fcrstner had committed\nsome incomprehensible offence against him. \"Alright then, if you need it\nto show what you mean, just take the bedside table then,\" said Miss\nB\u00fcrstner, and after a short pause added in a weak voice, \"I'm so tired\nI'm allowing more than I ought to.\" K. put the little table in the\nmiddle of the room and sat down behind it. \"You have to get a proper\nidea of where the people were situated, it is very interesting. I'm the\nsupervisor, sitting over there on the chest are two policemen, standing\nnext to the photographs there are three young people. Hanging on the\nhandle of the window is a white blouse--I just mention that by the way.\nAnd now it begins. Ah yes, I'm forgetting myself, the most important\nperson of all, so I'm standing here in front of the table. The\nsupervisor is sitting extremely comfortably with his legs crossed and\nhis arm hanging over the backrest here like some layabout. And now it\nreally does begin. The supervisor calls out as if he had to wake me up,\nin fact he shouts at me, I'm afraid, if I'm to make it clear to you,\nI'll have to shout as well, and it's nothing more than my name that he\nshouts out.\" Miss B\u00fcrstner, laughing as she listened to him, laid her\nforefinger on her mouth so that K. would not shout, but it was too late.\nK. was too engrossed in his role and slowly called out, \"Josef K.!\" It\nwas not as loud as he had threatened, but nonetheless, once he had\nsuddenly called it out, the cry seemed gradually to spread itself all\nround the room.\nThere was a series of loud, curt and regular knocks at the door of the\nadjoining room. Miss B\u00fcrstner went pale and laid her hand on her heart.\nK. was especially startled, as for a moment he had been quite unable to\nthink of anything other than the events of that morning and the girl for\nwhom he was performing them. He had hardly pulled himself together when\nhe jumped over to Miss B\u00fcrstner and took her hand. \"Don't be afraid,\" he\nwhispered, \"I'll put everything right. But who can it be? It's only the\nliving room next door, nobody sleeps in there.\" \"Yes they do,\" whispered\nMiss B\u00fcrstner into K.'s ear, \"a nephew of Mrs. Grubach's, a captain in\nthe army, has been sleeping there since yesterday. There's no other room\nfree. I'd forgotten about it too. Why did you have to shout like that?\nYou've made me quite upset.\" \"There is no reason for it,\" said K., and,\nnow as she sank back onto the cushion, kissed her forehead. \"Go away, go\naway,\" she said, hurriedly sitting back up, \"get out of here, go, what\nis it you want, he's listening at the door, he can hear everything.\nYou're causing me so much trouble!\" \"I won't go,\" said K., \"until you've\ncalmed down a bit. Come over into the other corner of the room, he\nwon't be able to hear us there.\" She let him lead her there. \"Don't\nforget,\" he said, \"although this might be unpleasant for you you're not\nin any real danger. You know how much esteem Mrs. Grubach has for me,\nshe's the one who will make all the decisions in this, especially as the\ncaptain is her nephew, but she believes everything I say without\nquestion. What's more, she has borrowed a large sum of money from me and\nthat makes her dependent on me. I will confirm whatever you say to\nexplain our being here together, however inappropriate it might be, and\nI guarantee to make sure that Mrs. Grubach will not only say she\nbelieves the explanation in public but will believe it truly and\nsincerely. You will have no need to consider me in any way. If you wish\nto let it be known that I have attacked you then Mrs. Grubach will be\ninformed of such and she will believe it without even losing her trust\nin me, that's how much respect she has for me.\" Miss B\u00fcrstner looked at\nthe floor in front of her, quiet and a little sunk in on herself. \"Why\nwould Mrs. Grubach not believe that I've attacked you?\" added K. He\nlooked at her hair in front of him, parted, bunched down, reddish and\nfirmly held in place. He thought she would look up at him, but without\nchanging her manner she said, \"Forgive me, but it was the suddenness of\nthe knocking that startled me so much, not so much what the consequences\nof the captain being here might be. It was all so quiet after you'd\nshouted, and then there was the knocking, that's what made me so\nshocked, and I was sitting right by the door, the knocking was right\nnext to me. Thank you for your suggestions, but I won't accept them. I\ncan bear the responsibility for anything that happens in my room myself,\nand I can do so with anyone. I'm surprised you don't realise just how\ninsulting your suggestions are and what they imply about me, although I\ncertainly acknowledge your good intentions. But now, please go, leave me\nalone, I need you to go now even more than I did earlier. The couple of\nminutes you asked for have grown into half an hour, more than half an\nhour now.\" K. took hold of her hand, and then of her wrist, \"You're not\ncross with me, though?\" he said. She pulled her hand away and answered,\n\"No, no, I'm never cross with anyone.\" He grasped her wrist once more,\nshe tolerated it now and, in that way, led him to the door. He had\nfully intended to leave. But when he reached the door he came to a halt\nas if he hadn't expected to find a door there, Miss B\u00fcrstner made use of\nthat moment to get herself free, open the door, slip out into the\nhallway and gently say to K. from there, \"Now, come along, please.\nLook,\" she pointed to the captain's door, from under which there was a\nlight shining, \"he's put a light on and he's laughing at us.\" \"Alright,\nI'm coming,\" said K., moved forward, took hold of her, kissed her on\nthe mouth and then over her whole face like a thirsty animal lapping\nwith its tongue when it eventually finds water. He finally kissed her on\nher neck and her throat and left his lips pressed there for a long time.\nHe did not look up until there was a noise from the captain's room.\n\"I'll go now,\" he said, he wanted to address Miss B\u00fcrstner by her\nChristian name, but did not know it. She gave him a tired nod, offered\nhim her hand to kiss as she turned away as if she did not know what she\nwas doing, and went back into her room with her head bowed. A short\nwhile later, K. was lying in his bed. He very soon went to sleep, but\nbefore he did he thought a little while about his behaviour, he was\nsatisfied with it but felt some surprise that he was not more satisfied;\nhe was seriously worried about Miss B\u00fcrstner because of the captain.",

            "text": "First Cross-examination\nK. was informed by telephone that there would be a small hearing\nconcerning his case the following Sunday. He was made aware that these\ncross examinations would follow one another regularly, perhaps not every\nweek but quite frequently. On the one hand it was in everyone's interest\nto bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion, but on the other hand\nevery aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughly\nwithout lasting too long because of the associated stress. For these\nreasons, it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinations\nfollowing on one after another. Sunday had been chosen as the day for\nthe hearings so that K. would not be disturbed in his professional work.\nIt was assumed that he would be in agreement with this, but if he wished\nfor another date then, as far as possible, he would be accommodated.\nCross-examinations could even be held in the night, for instance, but K.\nwould probably not be fresh enough at that time.

The deputy\ndirector picked up the receiver and, as he waited for his connection,\nturned away from it and said to K., \"One question, Mr. K.: Would you\nlike to give me the pleasure of joining me on my sailing boat on Sunday\nmorning? There's quite a few people coming, you're bound to know some\nof them. One of them is Hasterer, the state attorney. Would you like to\ncome along? Do come along!\" K. tried to pay attention to what the\ndeputy director was saying. It was of no small importance for him, as\nthis invitation from the deputy director, with whom he had never got on\nvery well, meant that he was trying to improve his relations with him.\nIt showed how important K. had become in the bank and how its second\nmost important official seemed to value his friendship, or at least his\nimpartiality. He was only speaking at the side of the telephone receiver\nwhile he waited for his connection, but in giving this invitation the\ndeputy director was humbling himself. But K. would have to humiliate him\na second time as a result, he said, \"Thank you very much, but I'm afraid\nI will have no time on Sunday, I have a previous obligation.\" \"Pity,\"\nsaid the deputy director, and turned to the telephone conversation that\nhad just been connected. It was not a short conversation, but K.\nremained standing confused by the instrument all the time it was going\non. It was only when the deputy director hung up that he was shocked\ninto awareness and said, in order to partially excuse his standing there\nfor no reason, \"I've just received a telephone call, there's somewhere I\nneed to go, but they forgot to tell me what time.\" \"Ask them then,\" said\nthe deputy director. \"It's not that important,\" said K., although in\nthat way his earlier excuse, already weak enough, was made even weaker.\nAs he went, the deputy director continued to speak about other things.",

Now, on a Sunday morning, most of the windows were occupied, men\nin their shirtsleeves leant out smoking, or carefully and gently held\nsmall children on the sills. Other windows were piled up with bedding,\nabove which the dishevelled head of a woman would briefly appear. People\ncalled out to each other across the street, one of the calls provoked a\nloud laugh about K. himself. It was a long street, and spaced evenly\nalong it were small shops below street level, selling various kinds of\nfoodstuffs, which you reached by going down a few steps. Women went in\nand out of them or stood chatting on the steps. A fruitmonger, taking\nhis goods up to the windows, was just as inattentive as K. and nearly\nknocked him down with his cart. Just then, a gramophone, which in better\nparts of town would have been seen as worn out, began to play some\nmurderous tune.\nK. went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty of time\nnow, or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one of\nthe windows and therefore knew that K. had found his way there. It was\nshortly after nine. The building was quite far down the street, it\ncovered so much area it was almost extraordinary, and the gateway in\nparticular was tall and long. It was clearly intended for delivery\nwagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were\nnow locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K. knew\nfrom his work at the bank. In contrast with his usual habits, he\nremained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in all\nthese external details. Near him, there was a bare-footed man sitting on\na crate and reading a newspaper. There were two lads swinging on a hand\ncart. In front of a pump stood a weak, young girl in a bedjacket who, as\nthe water flowed into her can, looked at K. There was a piece of rope\nstretched between two windows in a corner of the yard, with some washing\nhanging on it to dry. A man stood below it calling out instructions to\ndirect the work being done.\nK. went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing was to\ntake place, but then stood still again as besides these steps he could\nsee three other stairway entrances, and there also seemed to be a small\npassageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard. It\nirritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the\nroom, it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or\nespecially indifferent, and he decided to make that clear to them very",

He still felt unable to\nask for the investigating committee, and so he invented a joiner called\nLanz--that name occurred to him because the captain, Mrs. Grubach's\nnephew, was called Lanz--so that he could ask at every flat whether Lanz\nthe joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look into the rooms.\nIt turned out, though, that that was mostly possible without further\nado, as almost all the doors were left open and the children ran in and\nout. Most of them were small, one-windowed rooms where they also did the\ncooking. Many women held babies in one arm and worked at the stove with\nthe other. Half grown girls, who seemed to be dressed in just their\npinafores worked hardest running to and fro. In every room, the beds\nwere still in use by people who were ill, or still asleep, or people\nstretched out on them in their clothes. K. knocked at the flats where\nthe doors were closed and asked whether Lanz the joiner lived there. It\nwas usually a woman who opened the door, heard the enquiry and turned to\nsomebody in the room who would raise himself from the bed. \"The\ngentleman's asking if a joiner called Lanz, lives here.\" \"A joiner,\ncalled Lanz?\" he would ask from the bed.\" \"That's right,\" K. would say,\nalthough it was clear that the investigating committee was not to be\nfound there, and so his task was at an end. There were many who thought\nit must be very important for K. to find Lanz the joiner and thought\nlong about it, naming a joiner who was not called Lanz or giving a name\nthat had some vague similarity with Lanz, or they asked neighbours or\naccompanied K. to a door a long way away where they thought someone of\nthat sort might live in the back part of the building or where someone\nwould be who could advise K. better than they could themselves. K.\neventually had to give up asking if he did not want to be led all round\nfrom floor to floor in this way. He regretted his initial plan, which\nhad at first seemed so practical to him. As he reached the fifth floor,\nhe decided to give up the search, took his leave of a friendly, young\nworker who wanted to lead him on still further and went down the stairs.",

The\nfirst thing he saw in the small room was a large clock on the wall which\nalready showed ten o'clock. \"Is there a joiner called Lanz who lives\nhere?\" he asked. \"Pardon?\" said a young woman with black, shining eyes\nwho was, at that moment, washing children's underclothes in a bucket.\nShe pointed her wet hand towards the open door of the adjoining room.\nK. thought he had stepped into a meeting. A medium sized, two windowed\nroom was filled with the most diverse crowd of people--nobody paid any\nattention to the person who had just entered. Close under its ceiling it\nwas surrounded by a gallery which was also fully occupied and where the\npeople could only stand bent down with their heads and their backs\ntouching the ceiling. K., who found the air too stuffy, stepped out\nagain and said to the young woman, who had probably misunderstood what\nhe had said, \"I asked for a joiner, someone by the name of Lanz.\" \"Yes,\"\nsaid the woman, \"please go on in.\" K. would probably not have followed\nher if the woman had not gone up to him, taken hold of the door handle\nand said, \"I'll have to close the door after you, no-one else will be\nallowed in.\" \"Very sensible,\" said K., \"but it's too full already.\" But\nthen he went back in anyway. He passed through between two men who were\ntalking beside the door--one of them held both hands far out in front of\nhimself making the movements of counting out money, the other looked him\nclosely in the eyes--and someone took him by the hand. It was a small,\nred-faced youth. \"Come in, come in,\" he said. K. let himself be led by\nhim, and it turned out that there was--surprisingly in a densely packed\ncrowd of people moving to and fro--a narrow passage which may have been\nthe division between two factions; this idea was reinforced by the fact\nthat in the first few rows to the left and the right of him there was\nhardly any face looking in his direction, he saw nothing but the backs\nof people directing their speech and their movements only towards\nmembers of their own side. Most of them were dressed in black, in old,\nlong, formal frock coats that hung down loosely around them. These\nclothes were the only thing that puzzled K., as he would otherwise have\ntaken the whole assembly for a local political meeting.\nAt the other end of the hall where K. had been led there was a little\ntable set at an angle on a very low podium which was as overcrowded as\neverywhere else, and behind the table, near the edge of the podium, sat",

The muttering also became immediately\nlouder and, as the man said nothing more, died away only gradually. Now\nthe hall was much quieter than when K. had entered. Only the people up\nin the gallery had not stopped passing remarks. As far as could be\ndistinguished, up in the half-darkness, dust and haze, they seemed to be\nless well dressed than those below. Many of them had brought pillows\nthat they had put between their heads and the ceiling so that they would\nnot hurt themselves pressed against it.\nK. had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he did not\ndefend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said, \"Well\nmaybe I have arrived late, I'm here now.\" There followed loud applause,\nonce more from the right hand side of the hall. Easy people to get on\nyour side, thought K., and was bothered only by the quiet from the left\nhand side which was directly behind him and from which there was\napplause from only a few individuals. He wondered what he could say to\nget all of them to support him together or, if that were not possible,\nto at least get the support of the others for a while.\n\"Yes,\" said the man, \"but I'm now no longer under any obligation to hear\nyour case\"--there was once more a muttering, but this time it was\nmisleading as the man waved the people's objections aside with his hand\nand continued--\"I will, however, as an exception, continue with it\ntoday.

It was like an old school exercise book and had become quite\nmisshapen from much thumbing. \"Now then,\" said the judge, thumbing\nthrough the book. He turned to K. with the tone of someone who knows his\nfacts and said, \"you are a house painter?\" \"No,\" said K., \"I am the\nchief clerk in a large bank.\" This reply was followed by laughter among\nthe right hand faction down in the hall, it was so hearty that K.\ncouldn't stop himself joining in with it. The people supported\nthemselves with their hands on their knees and shook as if suffering a\nserious attack of coughing. Even some of those in the gallery were\nlaughing. The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power\nover those below him in the hall, he tried to reduce what harm had been\ndone in the gallery and jumped up threatening them, his eyebrows, until\nthen hardly remarkable, pushed themselves up and became big, black and\nbushy over his eyes.\nThe left hand side of the hall was still quiet, though, the people stood\nthere in rows with their faces looking towards the podium listening to\nwhat was being said there, they observed the noise from the other side\nof the hall with the same quietness and even allowed some individuals\nfrom their own ranks, here and there, to go forward into the other\nfaction. The people in the left faction were not only fewer in number\nthan the right but probably were no more important than them, although\ntheir behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like they were. When K.\nnow began to speak he was convinced he was doing it in the same way as\nthem.\n\"Your question, My Lord, as to whether I am a house painter--in fact\neven more than that, you did not ask at all but merely imposed it on\nme--is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me are\nbeing carried out. Perhaps you will object that there are no proceedings\nagainst me. You will be quite right, as there are proceedings only if I\nacknowledge that there are. But, for the moment, I do acknowledge it,\nout of pity for yourselves to a large extent. It's impossible not to\nobserve all this business without feeling pity. I don't say things are\nbeing done without due care but I would like to make it clear that it is\nI who make the acknowledgement.\"\nK. stopped speaking and looked down into the hall. He had spoken\nsharply, more sharply than he had intended, but he had been quite right.\nIt should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but\neverything was quiet, they were all clearly waiting for what would\nfollow, perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of\nactivity that would bring this whole affair to an end. It was somewhat\ndisturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened, the\nyoung washerwoman, who seemed to have finished her work, came in and,\ndespite all her caution, attracted the attention of some of the people\nthere.

Until then, he had\nlistened to him standing, as K.'s speech had taken him by surprise while\nhe was directing his attention to the gallery. Now, in the pause, he sat\ndown very slowly, as if he did not want anyone to notice. He took out\nthe notebook again, probably so that he could give the impression of\nbeing calmer.\n\"That won't help you, sir,\" continued K., \"even your little book will\nonly confirm what I say.\" K. was satisfied to hear nothing but his own\nquiet words in this room full of strangers, and he even dared casually\nto pick up the examining judge's notebook and, touching it only with the\ntips of his fingers as if it were something revolting, lifted it in the\nair, holding it just by one of the middle pages so that the others on\neach side of it, closely written, blotted and yellowing, flapped down.\n\"Those are the official notes of the examining judge,\" he said, and let\nthe notebook fall down onto the desk. \"You can read in your book as much\nas you like, sir, I really don't have anything in this charge book to be\nafraid of, even though I don't have access to it as I wouldn't want it\nin my hand, I can only touch it with two fingers.\" The judge grabbed the\nnotebook from where it had fallen on the desk--which could only have\nbeen a sign of his deep humiliation, or at least that is how it must\nhave been perceived--tried to tidy it up a little, and held it once more\nin front of himself in order to read from it.\nThe people in the front row looked up at him, showing such tension on\ntheir faces that he looked back down at them for some time. Every one of\nthem was an old man, some of them with white beards. Could they perhaps\nbe the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one way or the\nother. They had sunk into a state of motionlessness while K. gave his\noration, and it had not been possible to raise them from this passivity\neven when the judge was being humiliated. \"What has happened to me,\"\ncontinued K., with less of the vigour he had had earlier, he continually\nscanned the faces in the first row, and this gave his address a somewhat\nnervous and distracted character, \"what has happened to me is not just\nan isolated case. If it were it would not be of much importance as it's\nnot of much importance to me, but it is a symptom of proceedings which\nare carried out against many. It's on behalf of them that I stand here\nnow, not for myself alone.\"\nWithout having intended it, he had raised his voice. Somewhere in the\nhall, someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting, \"Bravo! Why\nnot then? Bravo! Again I say, Bravo!\" Some of the men in the first row\ngroped around in their beards, none of them looked round to see who was\nshouting. Not even K. thought him of any importance but it did raise his\nspirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all of those in\nthe hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majority of them began\nto think about the matter and if only one of them, now and then, was\npersuaded.\n\"I'm not trying to be a successful orator,\" said K. after this thought,\n\"that's probably more than I'm capable of anyway. I'm sure the examining\njudge can speak far better than I can, it is part of his job after all.\nAll that I want is a public discussion of a public wrong. Listen: ten\ndays ago I was placed under arrest, the arrest itself is something I\nlaugh about but that's beside the point. They came for me in the morning\nwhen I was still in bed. Maybe the order had been given to arrest some\nhouse painter--that seems possible after what the judge has\nsaid--someone who is as innocent as I am, but it was me they chose.\nThere were two police thugs occupying the next room. They could not have\ntaken better precautions if I had been a dangerous robber. And these\npolicemen were unprincipled riff-raff, they talked at me till I was sick\nof it, they wanted bribes, they wanted to trick me into giving them my\nclothes, they wanted money, supposedly so that they could bring me my\nbreakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in front of my\neyes. And even that was not enough. I was led in front of the supervisor\nin another room. This was the room of a lady who I have a lot of respect\nfor, and I was forced to look on while the supervisor and the policemen\nmade quite a mess of this room because of me, although not through any\nfault of mine. It was not easy to stay calm, but I managed to do so and\nwas completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it was that I was\nunder arrest. If he were here he would have to confirm what I say. I can\nsee him now, sitting on the chair belonging to that lady I mentioned--a\npicture of dull-witted arrogance. What do you think he answered? What\nhe told me, gentlemen, was basically nothing at all; perhaps he really\ndid know nothing, he had placed me under arrest and was satisfied. In\nfact he had done more than that and brought three junior employees from\nthe bank where I work into the lady's room; they had made themselves\nbusy interfering with some photographs that belonged to the lady and\ncausing a mess. There was, of course, another reason for bringing these\nemployees; they, just like my landlady and her maid, were expected to\nspread the news of my arrest and damage my public reputation and in\nparticular to remove me from my position at the bank. Well they didn't\nsucceed in any of that, not in the slightest, even my landlady, who is\nquite a simple person--and I will give you here her name in full\nrespect, her name is Mrs. Grubach--even Mrs. Grubach was understanding\nenough to see that an arrest like this has no more significance than an\nattack carried out on the street by some youths who are not kept under\nproper control. I repeat, this whole affair has caused me nothing but\nunpleasantness and temporary irritation, but could it not also have had\nsome far worse consequences?\"\nK. broke off here and looked at the judge, who said nothing. As he did\nso he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to give a sign\nto someone in the crowd. K. smiled and said, \"And now the judge, right\nnext to me, is giving a secret sign to someone among you. There seems to\nbe someone among you who is taking directions from above. I don't know\nwhether the sign is meant to produce booing or applause, but I'll resist\ntrying to guess what its meaning is too soon. It really doesn't matter\nto me, and I give his lordship the judge my full and public permission\nto stop giving secret signs to his paid subordinate down there and give\nhis orders in words instead; let him just say 'Boo now!,' and then the\nnext time 'Clap now!'\"\nWhether it was embarrassment or impatience, the judge rocked backwards\nand forwards on his seat. The man behind him, whom he had been talking\nwith earlier, leant forward again, either to give him a few general\nwords of encouragement or some specific piece of advice. Below them in\nthe hall the people talked to each other quietly but animatedly. The two\nfactions had earlier seemed to hold views strongly opposed to each other\nbut now they began to intermingle, a few individuals pointed up at K.,\nothers pointed at the judge. The air in the room was fuggy and extremely\noppressive, those who were standing furthest away could hardly even be\nseen through it. It must have been especially troublesome for those\nvisitors who were in the gallery, as they were forced to quietly ask\nthe participants in the assembly what exactly was happening, albeit\nwith timid glances at the judge. The replies they received were just as\nquiet, and given behind the protection of a raised hand.\n\"I have nearly finished what I have to say,\" said K., and as there was\nno bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that\nstartled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each\nother. \"None of this concerns me, and I am therefore able to make a calm\nassessment of it, and, assuming that this so-called court is of any real\nimportance, it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what I\nhave to say. If you want to discuss what I say, please don't bother to\nwrite it down until later on, I don't have any time to waste and I'll\nsoon be leaving.\"\nThere was immediate silence, which showed how well K. was in control of\nthe crowd. There were no shouts among them as there had been at the\nstart, no-one even applauded, but if they weren't already persuaded they\nseemed very close to it.\nK. was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they\nlistened to him, a rustling rose from the silence which was more\ninvigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been. \"There is\nno doubt,\" he said quietly, \"that there is some enormous organisation\ndetermining what is said by this court. In my case this includes my\narrest and the examination taking place here today, an organisation that\nemploys policemen who can be bribed, oafish supervisors and judges of\nwhom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as\nsome others. This organisation even maintains a high-level judiciary\nalong with its train of countless servants, scribes, policemen and all\nthe other assistance that it needs, perhaps even executioners and\ntorturers--I'm not afraid of using those words. And what, gentlemen, is\nthe purpose of this enormous organisation. Its purpose is to arrest\ninnocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, as\nin my case, lead to no result. How are we to avoid those in office\nbecoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning? That is\nimpossible, not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that for\nhimself. That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of\nthose they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes of\npeople they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated in\nfront of crowds rather than being given a proper trial. The policemen\nonly talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those\nthey arrest, I would like to see these warehouses where the hard won\npossessions of people under arrest is left to decay, if, that is, it's\nnot stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers.\"\nK. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall, he",

It was the washerwoman whom K. had\nrecognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had entered.\nIt was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not. K. could only\nsee that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and was pressing\nhimself against her. But it was not her who was screaming, but the man,\nhe had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling. A small\ncircle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near him in the\ngallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K. had introduced into\nthe gathering had been disturbed in this way. K.'s first thought was to\nrun over there, and he also thought that everyone would want to bring\nthings back into order there or at least to make the pair leave the\nroom, but the first row of people in front of him stayed were they were,\nno-one moved and no-one let K. through. On the contrary, they stood in\nhis way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from\nsomewhere--he did not have the time to turn round--took hold of his\ncollar. K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed to him\nthat his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken\nseriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he jumped\ndown from the podium. Now he stood face to face with the crowd. Had he\njudged the people properly? Had he put too much faith in the effect of\nhis speech? Had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had\nbeen speaking, and now that he came to the end and to what must follow,\nwere they tired of pretending? What faces they were, all around him!\nDark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down like on\ndrunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they took hold of\nthem it was more like they were making their hands into claws, not as if\nthey were taking hold of their own beards. But underneath those\nbeards--and this was the real discovery made by K.--there were badges of\nvarious sizes and colours shining on the collars of their coats. As far\nas he could see, every one of them was wearing one of these badges. All\nof them belonged to the same group, even though they seemed to be\ndivided to the right and the left of him, and when he suddenly turned\nround he saw the same badge on the collar of the examining judge who\ncalmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap. \"So,\" called out\nK., throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed\nmore room, \"all of you are working for this organisation, I see now that\nyou are all the very bunch of cheats and liars I've just been speaking\nabout, you've all pressed yourselves in here in order to listen in and\nsnoop on me, you gave the impression of having formed into factions, one\nof you even applauded me to test me out, and you wanted to learn how to\ntrap an innocent man! Well, I hope you haven't come here for nothing, I\nhope you've either had some fun from someone who expected you to defend\nhis innocence or else--let go of me or I'll hit you,\" shouted K. to a\nquivery old man who had pressed himself especially close to him--\"or\nelse that you've actually learned something. And so I wish you good luck\nin your trade.\" He briskly took his hat from where it lay on the edge of\nthe table and, surrounded by a silence caused perhaps by the\ncompleteness of their surprise, pushed his way to the exit. However, the\nexamining judge seems to have moved even more quickly than K., as he was",

He really was attracted to the woman, and even after\nthinking hard about it could find no good reason why he should not give\nin to her allure. It briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to\nentrap him on behalf of the court, but that was an objection he had no\ndifficulty in fending off. In what way could she entrap him? Was he not\nstill free, so free that he could crush the entire court whenever he\nwanted, at least where it concerned him? Could he not have that much\nconfidence in himself? And her offer of help sounded sincere, and maybe\nit wasn't quite worthless. And maybe there was no better revenge against\nthe examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and\nhave her for himself. Maybe then, after much hard work writing dishonest\nreports about K., the judge would go to the woman's bed late one night\nand find it empty. And it would be empty because she belonged to K.,\nbecause this woman at the window, this lush, supple, warm body in its\nsombre clothes of rough, heavy material belonged to him, totally to him\nand to him alone. Once he had settled his thoughts towards the woman in\nthis way, he began to find the quiet conversation at the window was\ntaking too long, he rapped on the podium with his knuckles, and then\neven with his fist. The student briefly looked away from the woman to\nglance at K. over his shoulder but did allow himself to be disturbed, in\nfact he even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around\nher. She dropped her head down low as if listening to him carefully, as\nshe did so he kissed her right on the neck, hardly even interrupting\nwhat he was saying. K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the\nstudent held over the woman and which she had already complained about,\nhe stood up and walked up and down the room. Glancing sideways at the\nstudent, he wondered what would be the quickest possible way to get rid\nof him, and so it was not unwelcome to him when the student, clearly\ndisturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing which K. had now developed into a\nstamping up and down, said to him, \"You don't have to stay here, you\nknow, if you're getting impatient. You could have gone earlier, no-one\nwould have missed you. In fact you should have gone, you should have\nleft as quickly as possible as soon as I got here.\" This comment could\nhave caused all possible rage to break out between them, but K. also\nbore in mind that this was a prospective court official speaking to a\ndisfavoured defendant, and he might well have been taking pride in\nspeaking in this way. K. remained standing quite close to him and said\nwith a smile, \"You're quite right, I am impatient, but the easiest way\nto settle this impatience would be if you left us. On the other hand,\nif you've come here to study--you are a student, I hear--I'll be quite\nhappy to leave the room to you and go away with the woman. I'm sure\nyou'll still have a lot of study to do before you're made into a judge.\nIt's true that I'm still not all that familiar with your branch of\njurisprudence but I take it it involves a lot more than speaking\nroughly--and I see you have no shame in doing that extremely well.\" \"He\nshouldn't have been allowed to move about so freely,\" said the student,\nas if he wanted to give the woman an explanation for K.'s insults, \"that\nwas a mistake. I've told the examining judge so. He should at least have\nbeen detained in his room between hearings. Sometimes it's impossible to\nunderstand what the judge thinks he's doing.\" \"You're wasting your\nbreath,\" said K., then he reached his hand out towards the woman and\nsaid, \"come with me.\" \"So that's it,\" said the student, \"oh no, you're\nnot going to get her,\" and with a strength you would not have expected\nfrom him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her up on one arm and, his\nback bent under the weight, ran with her to the door. In this way he\nshowed, unmistakably, that he was to some extent afraid of K., but he\nnonetheless dared to provoke him still further by stroking and squeezing\nthe woman's arm with his free hand. K. ran the few steps up to him, but\nwhen he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and, if\nnecessary, throttle him, the woman said, \"It's no good, it's the\nexamining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you, this little",

Nice to\nsee you here.\" And he offered K. his hand, which was far from what K.\nhad expected. And when K. said nothing, he added, \"There's no court\nsession planned for today, though.\" \"I know that,\" said K. as he looked\nat the usher's civilian coat which, beside its ordinary buttons,\ndisplayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and seemed to\nhave been taken from an old army officer's coat. \"I was speaking with\nyour wife a little while ago. She is no longer here. The student has\ncarried her off to the examining judge.\" \"Listen to this,\" said the\nusher, \"they're always carrying her away from me. It's Sunday today, and\nit's not part of my job to do any work today, but they send me off with\nsome message which isn't even necessary just to get me away from here.\nWhat they do is they send me off not too far away so that I can still\nhope to get back on time if I really hurry. So off I go running as fast\nas I can, shout the message through the crack in the door of the office\nI've been sent to, so out of breath they'll hardly be able to understand\nit, run back here again, but the student's been even faster than I\nhave--well he's got less far to go, he's only got to run down the steps.\nIf I wasn't so dependent on them I'd have squashed the student against\nthe wall here a long time ago. Right here, next to the sign. I'm always\ndreaming of doing that. Just here, just above the floor, that's where\nhe's crushed onto the wall, his arms stretched out, his fingers spread\napart, his crooked legs twisted round into a circle and blood squirted\nout all around him. It's only ever been a dream so far, though.\" \"Is\nthere nothing else you do?\" asked K. with a smile. \"Nothing that I know\nof,\" said the usher. \"And it's going to get even worse now, up till now\nhe's only been carrying her off for himself, now he's started carrying\nher off for the judge and all, just like I'd always said he would.\"\n\"Does your wife, then, not share some of the responsibility?\" asked K.\nHe had to force himself as he asked this question, as he, too, felt so\njealous now. \"Course she does,\" said the usher, \"it's more her fault\nthan theirs. It was her who attached herself to him. All he did, he just\nchases after any woman. There's five flats in this block alone where\nhe's been thrown out after working his way in there. And my wife is the\nbest looking woman in the whole building, but it's me who's not even\nallowed to defend himself.\" \"If that's how things are, then there's\nnothing that can be done,\" said K. \"Well why not?\" asked the usher.\n\"He's a coward that student, if he wants to lay a finger on my wife all\nyou'd have to do is give him such a good hiding he'd never dare do it\nagain. But I'm not allowed to do that, and nobody else is going to do me\nthe favour as they're all afraid of his power. The only one who could do\nit is a man like you.\" \"What, how could I do it?\" asked K. in\nastonishment. \"Well you're facing a charge, aren't you,\" said the usher.\n\"Yes, but that's all the more reason for me to be afraid. Even if he has\nno influence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some on the\ninitial examination.\" \"Yes, exactly,\" said the usher, as if K.'s view\nhad been just as correct as his own. \"Only we don't usually get any\ntrials heard here with no hope at all.\" \"I am not of the same opinion,\"\nsaid K., \"although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with the\nstudent if the opportunity arises.\" \"I would be very grateful to you,\"\nsaid the usher of the court, somewhat formally, not really seeming to\nbelieve that his highest wish could be fulfilled. \"Perhaps,\" continued\nK., \"perhaps there are some other officials of yours here, perhaps all\nof them, who would deserve the same.\" \"Oh yes, yes,\" said the usher, as\nif this was a matter of course. Then he looked at K. trustingly which,\ndespite all his friendliness, he had not done until then, and added,\n\"they're always rebelling.\" But the conversation seemed to have become a\nlittle uncomfortable for him, as he broke it off by saying, \"now I have\nto report to the office. Would you like to come with me?\" \"There's\nnothing for me to do there,\" said K. \"You'd be able to have a look at\nit. No-one will take any notice of you.\" \"Is it worth seeing then?\"\nasked K. hesitatingly, although he felt very keen to go with him.\n\"Well,\" said the usher, \"I thought you'd be interested in it.\" \"Alright\nthen,\" said K. finally, \"I'll come with you.\" And, quicker than the\nusher himself, he ran up the steps.",

            "explanation": "K. enters the waiting area.",
            "text": "At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was\nanother step. \"They don't show much concern for the public,\" he said.\n\"They don't show any concern at all,\" said the usher, \"just look at the\nwaiting room here.\" It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly\nmade doors led out to the separate departments of the attic. There was\nno direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the\ndepartments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to\nthe ceiling to separate them from the corridor. The light made its way\nin through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials\nthrough them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the\nwooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the\ngaps. There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it\nwas Sunday. They were not very impressive. They sat, equally spaced, on\ntwo rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both sides\nof the corridor. All of them were carelessly dressed although the\nexpressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and\nmany details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to\nthe upper classes. There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so they\nhad placed their hats under the bench, each probably having followed the\nexample of the others. When those who were sitting nearest the door saw\nK. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them, and when the\nothers saw that, they also thought they had to greet them, so that as\nthe two of them went by all the people there stood up. None of them\nstood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees bent, they\nstood like beggars on the street. K. waited for the usher, who was\nfollowing just behind him. \"They must all be very dispirited,\" he said.\n\"Yes,\" said the usher, \"they are the accused, everyone you see here has\nbeen accused.\" \"Really!\" said K. \"They're colleagues of mine then.\" And\nhe turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hair that was nearly\ngrey. \"What is it you are waiting for here?\" asked K., politely, but the\nman was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly, which was all the more\npitiful to see because the man clearly had some experience of the world\nand elsewhere would certainly have been able to show his superiority and\nwould not have easily given up the advantage he had acquired. Here,\nthough, he did not know what answer to give to such a simple question\nand looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to\nhelp him, and as if no-one could expect any answer from him without this\nhelp. Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order\nto calm him down and raise his spirits, said, \"The gentleman here's only\nasking what it is you're waiting for. You can give him an answer.\" The\nvoice of the usher was probably familiar to him, and had a better effect\nthan K.'s. \"I'm ... I'm waiting....\" he began, and then came to a halt.\nHe had clearly chosen this beginning so that he could give a precise\nanswer to the question, but now he didn't know how to continue. Some of\nthe others waiting had come closer and stood round the group, the usher\nof the court said to them, \"Get out the way, keep the gangway free.\"\nThey moved back slightly, but not as far as where they had been sitting\nbefore. In the meantime, the man whom K. had first approached had pulled\nhimself together and even answered him with a smile. \"A month ago I made\nsome applications for evidence to be heard in my case, and I'm waiting\nfor it to be settled.\" \"You certainly seem to be going to a lot of\neffort,\" said K. \"Yes,\" said the man, \"it is my affair after all.\" \"Not\neveryone thinks the same way as you do,\" said K. \"I've been indicted as\nwell but I swear on my soul that I've neither submitted evidence nor\ndone anything else of the sort. Do you really think that's necessary?\"\n\"I don't really know, exactly,\" said the man, once more totally unsure\nof himself; he clearly thought K. was joking with him and therefore\nprobably thought it best to repeat his earlier answer in order to avoid\nmaking any new mistakes. With K. looking at him impatiently, he just\nsaid, \"as far as I'm concerned, I've applied to have this evidence\nheard.\" \"Perhaps you don't believe I've been indicted?\" asked K. \"Oh,\nplease, I certainly do,\" said the man, stepping slightly to one side,\nbut there was more anxiety in his answer than belief. \"You don't believe\nme then?\" asked K., and took hold of his arm, unconsciously prompted by\nthe man's humble demeanour, and as if he wanted to force him to believe\nhim. But he did not want to hurt the man and had only taken hold of him\nvery lightly. Nonetheless, the man cried out as if K. had grasped him\nnot with two fingers but with red hot tongs. Shouting in this ridiculous\nway finally made K. tired of him, if he didn't believe he was indicted\nthen so much the better; maybe he even thought K. was a judge. And\nbefore leaving, he held him a lot harder, shoved him back onto the bench\nand walked on. \"These defendants are so sensitive, most of them,\" said\nthe usher of the court. Almost all of those who had been waiting had now\nassembled around the man who, by now, had stopped shouting and they\nseemed to be asking him lots of precise questions about the incident. K.\nwas approached by a security guard, identifiable mainly by his sword, of\nwhich the scabbard seemed to be made of aluminium. This greatly\nsurprised K., and he reached out for it with his hand. The guard had\ncome because of the shouting and asked what had been happening. The\nusher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the\nguard explained that he had to look into it himself, saluted, and\nhurried on, walking with very short steps, probably because of gout.\nK. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people,\nespecially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along\nit on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going\nthat way. He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the\nusher nodded, and that is the way that K. went. The usher remained\nalways one or two steps behind K., which he found irritating as in a\nplace like this it could give the impression that he was being driven\nalong by someone who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the\nusher to catch up, but the usher always remained behind him. In order to\nput an end to his discomfort, K. finally said, \"Now that I've seen what\nit looks like here, I'd like to go.\" \"You haven't seen everything yet,\"\nsaid the usher ingenuously. \"I don't want to see everything,\" said K.,\nwho was also feeling very tired, \"I want to go, what is the way to the\nexit?\" \"You haven't got lost, have you?\" asked the usher in amazement,\n\"you go down this way to the corner, then right down the corridor\nstraight ahead as far as the door.\" \"Come with me,\" said K., \"show me\nthe way, I'll miss it, there are so many different ways here.\" \"It's the\nonly way there is,\" said the usher, who had now started to sound quite\nreproachful, \"I can't go back with you again, I've got to hand in my\nreport, and I've already lost a lot of time because of you as it is.\"\n\"Come with me!\" K. repeated, now somewhat sharper as if he had finally\ncaught the usher out in a lie. \"Don't shout like that,\" whispered the\nusher, \"there's offices all round us here. If you don't want to go back\nby yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I've\nsorted out my report, then I'll be glad to go back with you again.\" \"No,\nno,\" said K., \"I will not wait and you must come with me now.\" K. had\nstill not looked round at anything at all in the room where he found\nhimself, and it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around\nhim opened that he noticed it. A young woman, probably summoned by the\nloudness of K.'s voice, entered and asked, \"What is it the gentleman\nwants?\" In the darkness behind her there was also a man approaching. K.\nlooked at the usher. He had, after all, said that no-one would take any\nnotice of K., and now there were two people coming, it only needed a few\nand everyone in the office would become aware of him and asking for\nexplanations as to why he was there. The only understandable and\nacceptable thing to say was that he was accused of something and wanted\nto know the date of his next hearing, but this was an explanation he did\nnot want to give, especially as it was not true--he had only come out of\ncuriosity. Or else, an explanation even less usable, he could say that\nhe wanted to ascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as\nit was on the outside. And it did seem that he had been quite right in\nthis supposition, he had no wish to intrude any deeper, he was disturbed\nenough by what he had seen already, he was not in the right frame of\nmind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind\nany door, and he wanted to go, either with the usher of the court or, if\nneeds be, alone.\nBut he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the\nyoung woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought\nhe would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they\ndidn't want to miss seeing. And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had\nnoticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam above\nthe low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming\nimpatient as he watched. But the young woman was the first to recognise\nthat K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell, she\nbrought a chair and asked, \"Would you not like to sit down?\" K. sat down\nimmediately and, in order to keep his place better, put his elbows on\nthe armrests. \"You're a little bit dizzy, aren't you?\" she asked him.\nHer face was now close in front of him, it bore the severe expression\nthat many young women have just when they're in the bloom of their\nyouth. \"It's nothing for you to worry about,\" she said, \"that's nothing\nunusual here, almost everyone gets an attack like that the first time\nthey come here. This is your first time is it. Yes, it's nothing unusual\nthen. The sun burns down on the roof and the hot wood makes the air so\nthick and heavy. It makes this place rather unsuitable for offices,\nwhatever other advantages it might offer. But the air is almost\nimpossible to breathe on days when there's a lot of business, and that's\nalmost every day. And when you think that there's a lot of washing put\nout to dry here as well--and we can't stop the tenants doing that--it's\nnot surprising you started to feel unwell. But you get used to the air\nalright in the end. When you're here for the second or third time you'll\nhardly notice how oppressive the air is. Are you feeling any better\nnow?\" K. made no answer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the\nmercy of these people by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason\nfor feeling ill made him feel not better but a little worse. The girl\nnoticed it straight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a\nwindow pole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small\nhatch directly above K.'s head that led to the outside. But so much soot\nfell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean\nthe soot off K.'s hands with her handkerchief, as K. was too tired to do\nthat for himself. He would have liked just to sit quietly where he was\nuntil he had enough strength to leave, and the less fuss people made\nabout him the sooner that would be. But then the girl said, \"You can't\nstay here, we're in people's way here....\" K. looked at her as if to ask\nwhose way they were impeding. \"If you like, I can take you to the sick\nroom,\" and turning to the man in the doorway said, \"please help me.\" The\nman immediately came over to them, but K. did not want to go to the sick\nroom, that was just what he wanted to avoid, being led further from\nplace to place, the further he went the more difficult it must become.\nSo he said, \"I am able to walk now,\" and stood up, shaking after\nbecoming used to sitting so comfortably. But then he was unable to stay\nupright. \"I can't manage it,\" he said shaking his head, and sat down\nagain with a sigh. He remembered the usher who, despite everything,\nwould have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed to have\ngone long before. K. looked out between the man and the young woman who\nwere standing in front of him but was unable to find the usher. \"I\nthink,\" said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whose appearance was\nmade especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had two long,\nsharply tailored points, \"the gentleman is feeling unwell because of the\natmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he would most prefer, would\nbe not to take him to the sick room but get him out of the offices\naltogether.\" \"That's right,\" exclaimed K., with such joy that he nearly\ninterrupted what the man was saying, \"I'm sure that'll make me feel\nbetter straight away, I'm really not that weak, all I need is a little\nsupport under my arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it's not such a\nlong way anyway, lead me to the door and then I'll sit on the stairs for\na while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks like this at\nall, I'm surprised at it myself. I also work in an office and I'm quite\nused to office air, but here it seems to be too strong, you've said so\nyourselves. So please, be so kind as to help me on my way a little, I'm\nfeeling dizzy, you see, and it'll make me ill if I stand up by myself.\"\nAnd with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for the two of\nthem to take him by the arms.\nThe man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood there\nwith his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud. \"There, you\nsee,\" he said to the girl, \"I was quite right. The gentleman is only\nunwell here, and not in general.\" The young woman smiled too, but\nlightly tapped the man's arm with the tips of her fingers as if he had\nallowed himself too much fun with K. \"So what do you think, then?\" said\nthe man, still laughing, \"I really do want to lead the gentleman out of\nhere.\" \"That's alright, then,\" said the girl, briefly inclining her\ncharming head. \"Don't worry too much about him laughing,\" said the girl\nto K., who had become unhappy once more and stared quietly in front of\nhimself as if needing no further explanation. \"This gentleman--may I\nintroduce you?\"--(the man gave his permission with a wave of the\nhand)--\"so, this gentleman's job is to give out information. He gives\nall the information they need to people who are waiting, as our court\nand its offices are not very well known among the public he gets asked\nfor quite a lot. He has an answer for every question, you can try him\nout if you feel like it. But that's not his only distinction, his other\ndistinction is his elegance of dress. We, that's to say all of us who\nwork in the offices here, we decided that the information-giver would\nhave to be elegantly dressed as he continually has to deal with the\nlitigants and he's the first one they meet, so he needs to give a\ndignified first impression. The rest of us I'm afraid, as you can see\njust by looking at me, dress very badly and old-fashioned; and there's\nnot much point in spending much on clothes anyway, as we hardly ever\nleave the offices, we even sleep here. But, as I said, we decided that\nthe information-giver would have to have nice clothes. As the management\nhere is rather peculiar in this respect, and they would get them for us,\nwe had a collection--some of the litigants contributed too--and bought\nhim these lovely clothes and some others besides. So everything would be\nready for him to give a good impression, except that he spoils it again\nby laughing and frightening people.\" \"That's how it is,\" said the man,\nmocking her, \"but I don't understand why it is that you're explaining\nall our intimate facts to the gentleman, or rather why it is that you're\npressing them on him, as I'm sure he's not all interested. Just look at\nhim sitting there, it's clear he's occupied with his own affairs.\" K.\njust did not feel like contradicting him. The girl's intention may have\nbeen good, perhaps she was under instructions to distract him or to give\nhim the chance to collect himself, but the attempt had not worked. \"I\nhad to explain to him why you were laughing,\" said the girl. \"I suppose\nit was insulting.\" \"I think he would forgive even worse insults if I\nfinally took him outside.\" K. said nothing, did not even look up, he\ntolerated the two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was\neven what suited him best. But suddenly he felt the information-giver's\nhand on one arm and the young woman's hand on the other. \"Up you get\nthen, weakling,\" said the information-giver. \"Thank you both very much,\"\nsaid K., pleasantly surprised, as he slowly rose and personally guided\nthese unfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support. As\nthey approached the corridor, the girl said quietly into K.'s ear, \"I\nmust seem to think it's very important to show the information-giver in\na good light, but you shouldn't doubt what I say, I just want to say the\ntruth. He isn't hard-hearted. It's not really his job to help litigants\noutside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you can see. I\ndon't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all like to be\nhelpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us to give the\nimpression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone. It makes\nme quite sad.\" \"Would you not like to sit down here a while?\" asked the\ninformation-giver, there were already in the corridor and just in front\nof the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier. K. felt almost ashamed\nto be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front of him and\nnow he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up by the\ninformation-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair was\ndishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead. But the\ndefendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood\nthere humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver for\nbeing there. The information-giver looked past him. \"I know,\" he said,\n\"that my case can't be settled today, not yet, but I've come in anyway,\nI thought, I thought I could wait here anyway, it's Sunday today, I've\ngot plenty of time, and I'm not disturbing anyone here.\" \"There's no\nneed to be so apologetic,\" said the information-giver, \"it's very\ncommendable for you to be so attentive. You are taking up space here\nwhen you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will do\nnothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as\nyou like. When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their\ncases one learns to show patience with people like you. Do sit down.\"\n\"He's very good with the litigants,\" whispered the girl. K. nodded, but",

It was as if he were suffering\nsea-sickness. He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea, as if the\nwater were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering from the\ndepths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, as if\nthe corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of it\nrising and sinking. It made the calmness of the girl and the man leading\nhim all the more incomprehensible. He was at their mercy, if they let go\nof him he would fall like a board. Their little eyes glanced here and\nthere, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but could not do the\nsame, as from step to step he was virtually being carried. He finally\nnoticed they were speaking to him but he did not understand them, all he\nheard was a noise that filled all the space and through which there\nseemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding, like a siren. \"Louder,\"\nhe whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed at having to ask them to\nspeak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly enough, even if it had\nbeen, for him, incomprehensible. At last, a draught of cool air blew in\nhis face as if a gap had been torn out in the wall in front of him, and\nnext to him he heard someone say, \"First he says he wants to go, and\nthen you can tell him a hundred times that this is the way out and he\ndoesn't move.\" K. became aware that he was standing in front of the way\nout, and that the young woman had opened the door. It seemed to him that\nall his strength returned to him at once, and to get a foretaste of\nfreedom he stepped straight on to one of the stairs and took his leave\nthere of his companions, who bowed to him. \"Thank you very much,\" he\nrepeated, shook their hands once more and did not let go until he\nthought he saw that they found it hard to bear the comparatively fresh\nair from the stairway after being so long used to the air in the\noffices. They were hardly able to reply, and the young woman might even\nhave fallen over if K. had not shut the door extremely fast. K. then\nstood still for a while, combed his hair with the help of a pocket\nmirror, picked up his hat from the next stair--the information-giver\nmust have thrown it down there--and then he ran down the steps so fresh\nand in such long leaps that the contrast with his previous state nearly\nfrightened him. His normally sturdy state of health had never prepared\nhim for surprises such as this. Did his body want to revolt and cause\nhim a new trial as he was bearing the old one with such little effort?\nHe did not quite reject the idea that he should see a doctor the next\ntime he had the chance, but whatever he did--and this was something on\nwhich he could advise himself--he wanted to spend all Sunday mornings in",

Does this\nclearing out have to be done on a Sunday?\" K. did not look up at Mrs.\nGrubach, but he saw nonetheless that she seemed to feel some relief as\nshe breathed in. Even sharp questions like this from Mr. K. she\nperceived as forgiveness, or as the beginning of forgiveness. \"We're not\nclearing anything out, Mr. K.,\" she said, \"it's just that Miss Montag is\nmoving in with Miss B\u00fcrstner and is moving her things across.\" She said\nnothing more, but just waited to see how K. would take it and whether he\nwould allow her to carry on speaking. But K. kept her in uncertainty,\ntook the spoon and pensively stirred his coffee while he remained\nsilent. Then he looked up at her and said, \"What about the suspicions\nyou had earlier about Miss B\u00fcrstner, have you given them up?\" \"Mr. K.,\"\ncalled Mrs. Grubach, who had been waiting for this very question, as she\nput her hands together and held them out towards him. \"I just made a\nchance remark and you took it so badly. I didn't have the slightest\nintention of offending anyone, not you or anyone else. You've known me\nfor long enough, Mr. K., I'm sure you're convinced of that. You don't\nknow how I've been suffering for the past few days! That I should tell\nlies about my tenants! And you, Mr. K., you believed it! And said I\nshould give you notice! Give you notice!\" At this last outcry, Mrs.\nGrubach was already choking back her tears, she raised her apron to her\nface and blubbered out loud.\n\"Oh, don't cry Mrs. Grubach,\" said K., looking out the window, he was\nthinking only of Miss B\u00fcrstner and how she was accepting an unknown girl\ninto her room. \"Now don't cry,\" he said again as he turned his look back\ninto the room where Mrs. Grubach was still crying. \"I meant no harm\neither when I said that. It was simply a misunderstanding between us.\nThat can happen even between old friends sometimes.\" Mrs. Grubach pulled\nher apron down to below her eyes to see whether K. really was attempting\na reconciliation. \"Well, yes, that's how it is,\" said K., and as Mrs.\nGrubach's behaviour indicated that the captain had said nothing he dared\nto add, \"Do you really think, then, that I'd want to make an enemy of\nyou for the sake of a girl we hardly know?\" \"Yes, you're quite right,\nMr. K.,\" said Mrs. Grubach, and then, to her misfortune, as soon as she\nfelt just a little freer to speak, she added something rather inept. \"I\nkept asking myself why it was that Mr. K. took such an interest in Miss\nB\u00fcrstner. Why does he quarrel with me over her when he knows that any\ncross word from him and I can't sleep that night? And I didn't say\nanything about Miss B\u00fcrstner that I hadn't seen with my own eyes.\" K.\nsaid nothing in reply, he should have chased her from the room as soon\nas she had opened her mouth, and he didn't want to do that. He contented\nhimself with merely drinking his coffee and letting Mrs. Grubach feel\nthat she was superfluous. Outside, the dragging steps of Miss Montag\ncould still be heard as she went from one side of the hallway to the\nother. \"Do you hear that?\" asked K. pointing his hand at the door.\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh, \"I wanted to give her some help\nand I wanted the maid to help her too but she's stubborn, she wants to\nmove everything in herself. I wonder at Miss B\u00fcrstner. I often feel it's\na burden for me to have Miss Montag as a tenant but Miss B\u00fcrstner\naccepts her into her room with herself.\" \"There's nothing there for you\nto worry about,\" said K., crushing the remains of a sugar lump in his\ncup. \"Does she cause you any trouble?\" \"No,\" said Mrs. Grubach, \"in\nitself it's very good to have her there, it makes another room free for\nme and I can let my nephew, the captain, occupy it. I began to worry he\nmight be disturbing you when I had to let him live in the living room\nnext to you over the last few days. He's not very considerate.\" \"What an\nidea!\" said K. standing up, \"there's no question of that. You seem to\nthink that because I can't stand this to-ing and fro-ing of Miss Montag\nthat I'm over-sensitive--and there she goes back again.\" Mrs. Grubach\nappeared quite powerless. \"Should I tell her to leave moving the rest of\nher things over till later, then, Mr. K.? If that's what you want I'll\ndo it immediately.\" \"But she has to move in with Miss B\u00fcrstner!\" said K.\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Grubach, without quite understanding what K. meant. \"So\nshe has to take her things over there.\" Mrs. Grubach just nodded. K. was\nirritated all the more by this dumb helplessness which, seen from the\noutside, could have seemed like a kind of defiance on her part. He began\nto walk up and down the room between the window and the door, thus\ndepriving Mrs. Grubach of the chance to leave, which she otherwise",

            "text": "Just as K. once more reached the door, someone knocked at it. It was the\nmaid, to say that Miss Montag would like to have a few words with Mr.\nK., and therefore requested that he come to the dining room where she\nwas waiting for him. K. heard the maid out thoughtfully, and then looked\nback at the shocked Mrs. Grubach in a way that was almost contemptuous.\nHis look seemed to be saying that K. had been expecting this invitation\nfor Miss Montag for a long time, and that it was confirmation of the\nsuffering he had been made to endure that Sunday morning from Mrs.\nGrubach's tenants. He sent the maid back with the reply that he was on\nhis way, then he went to the wardrobe to change his coat, and in answer\nto Mrs. Grubach's gentle whining about the nuisance Miss Montag was\ncausing merely asked her to clear away the breakfast things. \"But you've\nhardly touched it,\" said Mrs. Grubach. \"Oh just take it away!\" shouted\nK. It seemed to him that Miss Montag was mixed up in everything and made\nit repulsive to him.\nAs he went through the hallway he looked at the closed door of Miss\nB\u00fcrstner's room. But it wasn't there that he was invited, but the dining\nroom, to which he yanked the door open without knocking.\nThe room was long but narrow with one window. There was only enough\nspace available to put two cupboards at an angle in the corner by the\ndoor, and the rest of the room was entirely taken up with the long\ndining table which started by the door and reached all the way to the\ngreat window, which was thus made almost inaccessible. The table was\nalready laid for a large number of people, as on Sundays almost all the\ntenants ate their dinner here at midday.\nWhen K. entered, Miss Montag came towards him from the window along one\nside of the table. They greeted each other in silence. Then Miss Montag,\nher head unusually erect as always, said, \"I'm not sure whether you know\nme.\" K. looked at her with a frown. \"Of course I do,\" he said, \"you've\nbeen living here with Mrs. Grubach for quite some time now.\" \"But I get\nthe impression you don't pay much attention to what's going on in the\nlodging house,\" said Miss Montag. \"No,\" said K. \"Would you not like to\nsit down?\" said Miss Montag. In silence, the two of them drew chairs out\nfrom the farthest end of the table and sat down facing each other. But\nMiss Montag stood straight up again as she had left her handbag on the\nwindow sill and went to fetch it; she shuffled down the whole length of\nthe room. When she came back, the handbag lightly swinging, she said,\n\"I'd like just to have a few words with you on behalf of my friend. She\nwould have come herself, but she's feeling a little unwell today.\nPerhaps you'll be kind enough to forgive her and listen to me instead.\nThere's anyway nothing that she could have said that I won't. On the\ncontrary, in fact, I think I can say even more than her because I'm\nrelatively impartial. Would you not agree?\" \"What is there to say,\nthen?\" answered K., who was tired of Miss Montag continuously watching\nhis lips. In that way she took control of what he wanted to say before\nhe said it. \"Miss B\u00fcrstner clearly refuses to grant me the personal\nmeeting that I asked her for.\" \"That's how it is,\" said Miss Montag, \"or\nrather, that's not at all how it is, the way you put it is remarkably\nsevere. Generally speaking, meetings are neither granted nor the\nopposite. But it can be that meetings are considered unnecessary, and\nthat's how it is here. Now, after your comment, I can speak openly. You\nasked my friend, verbally or in writing, for the chance to speak with\nher. Now my friend is aware of your reasons for asking for this\nmeeting--or at least I suppose she is--and so, for reasons I know\nnothing about, she is quite sure that it would be of no benefit to\nanyone if this meeting actually took place. Moreover, it was only\nyesterday, and only very briefly, that she made it clear to me that such\na meeting could be of no benefit for yourself either, she feels that it\ncan only have been a matter of chance that such an idea came to you, and\nthat even without any explanations from her, you will very soon come to\nrealise yourself, if you have not done so already, the futility of your\nidea. My answer to that is that although it may be quite right, I\nconsider it advantageous, if the matter is to be made perfectly clear,\nto give you an explicit answer. I offered my services in taking on the\ntask, and after some hesitation my friend conceded. I hope, however,\nalso to have acted in your interests, as even the slightest uncertainty\nin the least significant of matters will always remain a cause of\nsuffering and if, as in this case, it can be removed without substantial\neffort, then it is better if that is done without delay.\" \"I thank you,\"\nsaid K. as soon as Miss Montag had finished. He stood slowly up, looked\nat her, then across the table, then out the window--the house opposite\nstood there in the sun--and went to the door. Miss Montag followed him a",

            "text": "The whip-man\nOne evening, a few days later, K. was walking along one of the corridors\nthat separated his office from the main stairway--he was nearly the last\none to leave for home that evening, there remained only a couple of\nworkers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatch department--when\nhe heard a sigh from behind a door which he had himself never opened but\nwhich he had always thought just led into a junk room. He stood in\namazement and listened again to establish whether he might not be\nmistaken. For a while there was silence, but then came some more sighs.\nHis first thought was to fetch one of the servitors, it might well have\nbeen worth having a witness present, but then he was taken by an\nuncontrollable curiosity that make him simply yank the door open. It\nwas, as he had thought, a junk room. Old, unusable forms, empty stone\nink-bottles lay scattered behind the entrance. But in the cupboard-like\nroom itself stood three men, crouching under the low ceiling. A candle\nfixed on a shelf gave them light. \"What are you doing here?\" asked K.\nquietly, but crossly and without thinking. One of the men was clearly in\ncharge, and attracted attention by being dressed in a kind of dark\nleather costume which left his neck and chest and his arms exposed. He\ndid not answer. But the other two called out, \"Mr. K.! We're to be\nbeaten because you made a complaint about us to the examining judge.\"\nAnd now, K. finally realised that it was actually the two policemen,\nFranz and Willem, and that the third man held a cane in his hand with\nwhich to beat them. \"Well,\" said K., staring at them, \"I didn't make any\ncomplaint, I only said what took place in my home. And your behaviour\nwas not entirely unobjectionable, after all.\" \"Mr. K.,\" said Willem,\nwhile Franz clearly tried to shelter behind him as protection from the\nthird man, \"if you knew how badly we get paid you wouldn't think so\nbadly of us. I've got a family to feed, and Franz here wanted to get\nmarried, you just have to get more money where you can, you can't do it\njust by working hard, not however hard you try. I was sorely tempted by\nyour fine clothes, policemen aren't allowed to do that sort of thing,\ncourse they aren't, and it wasn't right of us, but it's tradition that\nthe clothes go to the officers, that's how it's always been, believe me;\nand it's understandable too, isn't it, what can things like that mean\nfor anyone unlucky enough to be arrested. But if he starts talking about\nit openly then the punishment has to follow.\" \"I didn't know about any\nof this that you've been telling me, and I made no sort of request that\nyou be punished, I was simply acting on principle.\" \"Franz,\" said\nWillem, turning to the other policeman, \"didn't I tell you that the\ngentleman didn't say he wanted us to be punished. Now you can hear for\nyourself, he didn't even know we'd have to be punished.\" \"Don't you let\nthem persuade you, talking like that,\" said the third man to K., \"this\npunishment is both just and unavoidable.\" \"Don't listen to him,\" said\nWillem, interrupting himself only to quickly bring his hand to his mouth\nwhen it had received a stroke of the cane, \"we're only being punished\nbecause you made a complaint against us. Nothing would have happened to\nus otherwise, not even if they'd found out what we'd done. Can you call\nthat justice? Both of us, me especially, we'd proved our worth as good\npolice officers over a long period--you've got to admit yourself that as\nfar as official work was concerned we did the job well--things looked\ngood for us, we had prospects, it's quite certain that we would've been\nmade whip-men too, like this one, only he had the luck not to have\nanyone make a complaint about him, as you really don't get many\ncomplaints like that. Only that's all finished now, Mr. K., our careers\nare at an end, we're going to have to do work now that's far inferior to\npolice work and besides all this we're going to get this terrible,\npainful beating.\" \"Can the cane really cause so much pain, then?\" asked\nK., testing the cane that the whip-man swang in front of him. \"We're\ngoing to have to strip off totally naked,\" said Willem. \"Oh, I see,\"\nsaid K., looking straight at the whip-man, his skin was burned brown\nlike a sailor's, and his face showed health and vigour. \"Is there then\nno possibility of sparing these two their beating?\" he asked him. \"No,\"\nsaid the whip-man, shaking his head with a laugh. \"Get undressed!\" he\nordered the policemen. And to K. he said, \"You shouldn't believe\neverything they tell you, it's the fear of being beaten, it's already\nmade them a bit weak in the head. This one here, for instance,\" he\npointed at Willem, \"all that he told you about his career prospects,\nit's just ridiculous. Look at him, look how fat he is--the first strokes\nof the cane will just get lost in all that fat. Do you know what it is\nthat's made him so fat. He's in the habit of, everyone that gets\narrested by him, he eats their breakfast. Didn't he eat up your\nbreakfast? Yeah, I thought as much. But a man with a belly like that\ncan't be made into a whip-man and never will be, that is quite out of\nthe question.\" \"There are whip-men like that,\" Willem insisted, who had\njust released the belt of this trousers. \"No,\" said the whip-man,\nstriking him such a blow with the cane on his neck that it made him\nwince, \"you shouldn't be listening to this, just get undressed.\" \"I\nwould make it well worth your while if you would let them go,\" said K.,\nand without looking at the whip-man again--as such matters are best\ncarried on with both pairs of eyes turned down--he pulled out his\nwallet. \"And then you'd try and put in a complaint against me, too,\"\nsaid the whip-man, \"and get me flogged. No, no!\" \"Now, do be\nreasonable,\" said K., \"if I had wanted to get these two punished I would\nnot now be trying to buy their freedom, would I? I could simply close\nthe door here behind me, go home and see or hear nothing more of it. But\nthat's not what I'm doing, it really is of much more importance to me to\nlet them go free; if I had realised they would be punished, or even that\nthey might be punished, I would never have named them in the first place\nas they are not the ones I hold responsible. It's the organisation\nthat's to blame, the high officials are the ones to blame.\" \"That's how\nit is!\" shouted the policemen, who then immediately received another\nblow on their backs, which were by now exposed. \"If you had a senior\njudge here beneath your stick,\" said K., pressing down the cane as he\nspoke to stop it being raised once more, \"I really would do nothing to\nstop you, on the contrary, I would even pay you money to give you all\nthe more strength.\" \"Yeah, that's all very plausible, what you're saying\nthere,\" said the whip-man, \"only I'm not the sort of person you can\nbribe. It's my job to flog people, so I flog them.\" Franz, the\npoliceman, had been fairly quiet so far, probably in expectation of a\ngood result from K.'s intervention, but now he stepped forward to the\ndoor wearing just his trousers, knelt down hanging on to K.'s arm and\nwhispered, \"Even if you can't get mercy shown for both of us, at least\ntry and get me set free. Willem is older than me, he's less sensitive\nthan me in every way, he even got a light beating a couple of years\nago, but my record's still clean, I only did things the way I did\nbecause Willem led me on to it, he's been my teacher both for good and\nbad. Down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me at the\nentrance, I'm so ashamed of myself, it's pitiful.\" His face was flowing\nover with tears, and he wiped it dry on K.'s coat. \"I'm not going to\nwait any longer,\" said the whip-man, taking hold of the cane in both\nhands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner and\nlooked on secretly, not even daring to turn his head. Then, the sudden\nscream that shot out from Franz was long and irrevocable, it seemed to\ncome not from a human being but from an instrument that was being\ntortured, the whole corridor rang with it, it must have been heard by\neveryone in the building. \"Don't shout like that!\", called out K.,\nunable to prevent himself, and, as he looked anxiously in the direction\nfrom which the servitor would come, he gave Franz a shove, not hard, but\nhard enough for him to fall down unconscious, clawing at the ground with\nhis hands by reflex; he still did not avoid being hit; the rod still\nfound him on the floor; the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down\nwhile he rolled to and fro under its blows. And now one of the servitors\nappeared in the distance, with another a few steps behind him. K. had\nquickly thrown the door shut, gone over to one of the windows\noverlooking the yard and opened it. The screams had completely stopped.\nSo that the servitor wouldn't come in, he called out, \"It's only me!\"\n\"Good evening, chief clerk,\" somebody called back. \"Is there anything\nwrong?\" \"No, no,\" answered K., \"it's only a dog yelping in the yard.\"\nThere was no sound from the servitors so he added, \"You can go back to\nwhat you were doing.\" He did not want to become involved with a\nconversation with them, and so he leant out of the window. A little\nwhile later, when he looked out in the corridor, they had already gone.\nNow, K. remained at the window, he did not dare go back into the junk\nroom, and he did not want to go home either. The yard he looked down\ninto was small and rectangular, all around it were offices, all the\nwindows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection\nof the moon. K. tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the\nyard, where a few handcarts had been left behind one another. He felt\nanguish at not having been able to prevent the flogging, but that was\nnot his fault, if Franz had not screamed like that--clearly it must have\ncaused a great deal of pain but it's important to maintain control of\noneself at important moments--if Franz had not screamed then it was at\nleast highly probable that K. would have been able to dissuade the\nwhip-man. If all the junior officers were contemptible why would the\nwhip-man, whose position was the most inhumane of all, be any exception,\nand K. had noticed very clearly how his eyes had lit up when he saw the\nbanknotes, he had obviously only seemed serious about the flogging to\nraise the level of the bribe a little. And K. had not been ungenerous,\nhe really had wanted to get the policemen freed; if he really had now\nbegun to do something against the degeneracy of the court then it was a\nmatter of course that he would have to do something here as well. But of\ncourse, it became impossible for him to do anything as soon as Franz\nstarted screaming. K. could not possibly have let the junior bank staff,\nand perhaps even all sorts of other people, come along and catch him by\nsurprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room. Nobody could\nreally expect that sort of sacrifice of him. If that had been his\nintention then it would almost have been easier, K. would have taken\nhis own clothes off and offered himself to the whip-man in the\npolicemen's place. The whip-man would certainly not have accepted this\nsubstitution anyway, as in that way he would have seriously violated his\nduty without gaining any benefit. He would most likely have violated his\nduty twice over, as court employees were probably under orders not to\ncause any harm to K. while he was facing charges, although there may\nhave been special conditions in force here. However things stood, K. was\nable to do no more than throw the door shut, even though that would\nstill do nothing to remove all the dangers he faced. It was regrettable\nthat he had given Franz a shove, and it could only be excused by the\nheat of the moment.\nIn the distance, he heard the steps of the servitors; he did not want\nthem to be too aware of his presence, so he closed the window and\nwalked towards the main staircase. At the door of the junk room he\nstopped and listened for a little while. All was silent. The two\npolicemen were entirely at the whip-man's mercy; he could have beaten\nthem to death. K. reached his hand out for the door handle but drew it\nsuddenly back. He was no longer in any position to help anyone, and the\nservitors would soon be back; he did, though, promise himself that he\nwould raise the matter again with somebody and see that, as far as it\nwas in his power, those who really were guilty, the high officials whom\nnobody had so far dared point out to him, received their due punishment.\nAs he went down the main stairway at the front of the bank, he looked\ncarefully round at everyone who was passing, but there was no girl to be\nseen who might have been waiting for somebody, not even within some\ndistance from the bank. Franz's claim that his bride was waiting for him\nwas thus shown to be a lie, albeit one that was forgivable and intended\nonly to elicit more sympathy.\nThe policemen were still on K.'s mind all through the following day; he\nwas unable to concentrate on his work and had to stay in his office a\nlittle longer than the previous day so that he could finish it. On the\nway home, as he passed by the junk room again, he opened its door as if\nthat had been his habit. Instead of the darkness he expected, he saw\neverything unchanged from the previous evening, and did not know how he\nshould respond. Everything was exactly the same as he had seen it when\nhe had opened the door the previous evening. The forms and bottles of\nink just inside the doorway, the whip-man with his cane, the two\npolicemen, still undressed, the candle on the shelf, and the two\npolicemen began to wail and call out \"Mr. K.!\" K. slammed the door\nimmediately shut, and even thumped on it with his fists as if that\nwould shut it all the firmer. Almost in tears, he ran to the servitors",

            "text": "K.'s uncle--Leni\nOne afternoon--K. was very busy at the time, getting the post\nready--K.'s Uncle Karl, a small country land owner, came into the room,\npushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some\npapers. K. had long expected his uncle to appear, but the sight of him\nnow shocked K. far less than the prospect of it had done a long time\nbefore. His uncle was bound to come, K. had been sure of that for about\na month. He already thought at the time he could see how his uncle\nwould arrive, slightly bowed, his battered panama hat in his left hand,\nhis right hand already stretched out over the desk long before he was\nclose enough as he rushed carelessly towards K. knocking over everything\nthat was in his way. K.'s uncle was always in a hurry, as he suffered\nfrom the unfortunate belief that he had a number of things to do while\nhe was in the big city and had to settle all of them in one day--his\nvisits were only ever for one day--and at the same time thought he could\nnot forgo any conversation or piece of business or pleasure that might\narise by chance. Uncle Karl was K.'s former guardian, and so K. was\nduty-bound to help him in all of this as well as to offer him a bed for\nthe night. \"I'm haunted by a ghost from the country,\" he would say.\nAs soon as they had greeted each other--K. had invited him to sit in\nthe armchair but Uncle Karl had no time for that--he said he wanted to\nspeak briefly with K. in private. \"It is necessary,\" he said with a\ntired gulp, \"it is necessary for my peace of mind.\" K. immediately sent\nthe junior staff from the room and told them to let no-one in. \"What's\nthis that I've been hearing, Josef?\" cried K.'s uncle when they were\nalone, as he sat on the table shoving various papers under himself\nwithout looking at them to make himself more comfortable. K. said\nnothing, he knew what was coming, but, suddenly relieved from the\neffort of the work he had been doing, he gave way to a pleasant\nlassitude and looked out the window at the other side of the street.\nFrom where he sat, he could see just a small, triangular section of it,\npart of the empty walls of houses between two shop windows. \"You're\nstaring out the window!\" called out his uncle, raising his arms, \"For\nGod's sake, Josef, give me an answer! Is it true, can it really be\ntrue?\" \"Uncle Karl,\" said K., wrenching himself back from his\ndaydreaming, \"I really don't know what it is you want of me.\" \"Josef,\"\nsaid his uncle in a warning tone, \"as far as I know, you've always told\nthe truth. Am I to take what you've just said as a bad sign?\" \"I think I\nknow what it is you want,\" said K. obediently, \"I expect you've heard\nabout my trial.\" \"That's right,\" answered his uncle with a slow nod,\n\"I've heard about your trial.\" \"Who did you hear it from, then?\" asked\nK. \"Erna wrote to me,\" said his uncle, \"she doesn't have much contact\nwith you, it's true, you don't pay very much attention to her, I'm\nafraid to say, but she learned about it nonetheless. I got her letter\ntoday and, of course, I came straight here. And for no other reason, but\nit seems to me that this is reason enough. I can read you out the part\nof the letter that concerns you.\" He drew the letter out from his\nwallet. \"Here it is. She writes; 'I have not seen Josef for a long time,\nI was in the bank last week but Josef was so busy that they would not\nlet me through; I waited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go\nhome as I had my piano lesson. I would have liked to have spoken to him,\nmaybe there will be a chance another time. He sent me a big box of\nchocolates for my name-day, that was very nice and attentive of him. I\nforgot to tell you about it when I wrote, and I only remember now that\nyou ask me about it. Chocolate, as I am sure you are aware, disappears\nstraight away in this lodging house, almost as soon as you know somebody\nhas given you chocolate it is gone. But there is something else I wanted\nto tell you about Josef. Like I said, they would not let me through to\nsee him at the bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just\nthen. After I had been waiting quietly for quite a long time I asked one\nof the staff whether his meeting would last much longer. He said it\nmight well do, as it was probably about the legal proceedings, he said,\nthat were being conducted against him. I asked what sort of legal\nproceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk,\nand whether he was not making some mistake, but he said he was not\nmaking any mistake, there were legal proceedings underway and even that\nthey were about something quite serious, but he did not know any more\nabout it. He would have liked to have been of some help to the chief\nclerk himself, as the chief clerk was a gentleman, good and honest, but\nhe did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be\nsome influential gentlemen who would take his side. I'm sure that is\nwhat will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the\nend, but in the mean time things do not look at all good, and you can\nsee that from the mood of the chief clerk himself. Of course, I did not\nplace too much importance on this conversation, and even did my best to\nput the bank clerk's mind at rest, he was quite a simple man. I told him\nhe was not to speak to anyone else about this, and I think it is all\njust a rumour, but I still think it might be good if you, Dear Father,\nif you looked into the matter the next time you visit. It will be easy\nfor you to find out more detail and, if it is really necessary, to do\nsomething about it through the great and influential people you know.\nBut if it is not necessary, and that is what seems most likely, then at\nleast your daughter will soon have the chance to embrace you and I look\nforward to it.'--She's a good child,\" said K.'s uncle when he had\nfinished reading, and wiped a few tears from his eyes. K. nodded. With\nall the different disruptions he had had recently he had completely\nforgotten about Erna, even her birthday, and the story of the chocolates\nhad clearly just been invented so that he wouldn't get in trouble with\nhis aunt and uncle. It was very touching, and even the theatre tickets,\nwhich he would regularly send her from then on, would not be enough to\nrepay her, but he really did not feel, now, that it was right for him to\nvisit her in her lodgings and hold conversations with a little, eighteen\nyear old schoolgirl. \"And what do you have to say about that?\" asked his\nuncle, who had forgotten all his rush and excitement as he read the\nletter, and seemed to be about to read it again. \"Yes, Uncle,\" said K.,\n\"it is true.\" \"True!\" called out his uncle. \"What is true? How can this\nbe true? What sort of trial is it? Not a criminal trial, I hope?\" \"It's\na criminal trial,\" answered K. \"And you sit quietly here while you've\ngot a criminal trial round your neck?\" shouted his uncle, getting ever\nlouder. \"The more calm I am, the better it will be for the outcome,\"\nsaid K. in a tired voice, \"don't worry.\" \"How can I help worrying?!\"\nshouted his uncle, \"Josef, my dear Josef, think about yourself, about\nyour family, think about our good name! Up till now, you've always been\nour pride, don't now become our disgrace. I don't like the way you're\nbehaving,\" he said, looking at K. with his head at an angle, \"that's not\nhow an innocent man behaves when he's accused of something, not if he's\nstill got any strength in him. Just tell me what it's all about so that\nI can help you. It's something to do with the bank, I take it?\" \"No,\"\nsaid K. as he stood up, \"and you're speaking too loud, Uncle, I expect\none of the staff is listening at the door and I find that rather\nunpleasant. It's best if we go somewhere else, then I can answer all\nyour questions, as far as I can. And I know very well that I have to\naccount to the family for what I do.\" \"You certainly do!\" his uncle\nshouted, \"Quite right, you do. Now just get a move on, Josef, hurry up\nnow!\" \"I still have a few documents I need to prepare,\" said K., and,\nusing the intercom, he summoned his deputy who entered a few moments\nlater. K.'s uncle, still angry and excited, gestured with his hand to\nshow that K. had summoned him, even though there was no need whatever to\ndo so. K. stood in front of the desk and explained to the young man, who\nlistened calm and attentive, what would need to be done that day in his\nabsence, speaking in a calm voice and making use of various documents.\nThe presence of K.'s uncle while this was going on was quite disturbing;\nhe did not listen to what was being said, but at first he stood there\nwith eyes wide open and nervously biting his lips. Then he began to walk\nup and down the room, stopped now and then at the window, or stood in\nfront of a picture always making various exclamations such as, \"That is\ntotally incomprehensible to me!\" or \"Now just tell me, what are you\nsupposed to make of that?\" The young man pretended to notice nothing of\nthis and listened to K.'s instructions through to the end, he made a few\nnotes, bowed to both K. and his uncle and then left the room. K.'s uncle\nhad turned his back to him and was looking out the window, bunching up\nthe curtains with his outstretched hands. The door had hardly closed\nwhen he called out, \"At last! Now that he's stopped jumping about we can\ngo too!\" Once they were in the front hall of the bank, where several",

His uncle took K.'s arm and stopped\nasking questions with such urgency about the trial, they walked on for a\nwhile in silence. \"But how did all this come about?\" he eventually\nasked, stopping abruptly enough to startle the people walking behind,\nwho had to avoid walking into him. \"Things like this don't come all of a\nsudden, they start developing a long time beforehand, there must have\nbeen warning signs of it, why didn't you write to me? You know I'd do\nanything for you, to some extent I am still your guardian, and until\ntoday that's something I was proud of. I'll still help you, of course I\nwill, only now, now that the trial is already underway, it makes it\nvery difficult. But whatever; the best thing now is for you to take a\nshort holiday staying with us in the country. You've lost weight, I can\nsee that now. The country life will give you strength, that will be\ngood, there's bound to be a lot of hard work ahead of you. But besides\nthat it'll be a way of getting you away from the court, to some extent.\nHere they've got every means of showing the powers at their disposal\nand they're automatically bound to use them against you; in the country\nthey'll either have to delegate authority to different bodies or just\nhave to try and bother you by letter, telegram or telephone. And that's\nbound to weaken the effect, it won't release you from them but it'll\ngive you room to breathe.\" \"You could forbid me to leave,\" said K., who\nhad been drawn slightly into his uncle's way of thinking by what he had\nbeen saying. \"I didn't think you would do it,\" said his uncle\nthoughtfully, \"you won't suffer too much loss of power by moving away.\"\nK. grasped his uncle under the arm to prevent him stopping still and\nsaid, \"I thought you'd think all this is less important than I do, and\nnow you're taking it so hard.\" \"Josef,\" called his uncle trying to\ndisentangle himself from him so that he could stop walking, but K. did\nnot let go, \"you've completely changed, you used to be so astute, are\nyou losing it now? Do you want to lose the trial? Do you realise what\nthat would mean? That would mean you would be simply destroyed. And\nthat everyone you know would be pulled down with you or at the very\nleast humiliated, disgraced right down to the ground. Josef, pull\nyourself together. The way you're so indifferent about it, it's driving\nme mad. Looking at you I can almost believe that old saying: 'Having a\ntrial like that means losing a trial like that'.\" \"My dear Uncle,\" said\nK., \"it won't do any good to get excited, it's no good for you to do it\nand it'd be no good for me to do it. The case won't be won by getting\nexcited, and please admit that my practical experience counts for\nsomething, just as I have always and still do respect your experience,\neven when it surprises me. You say that the family will also be\naffected by this trial; I really can't see how, but that's beside the\npoint and I'm quite willing to follow your instructions in all of this.\nOnly, I don't see any advantage in staying in the country, not even for\nyou, as that would indicate flight and a sense of guilt. And besides,\nalthough I am more subject to persecution if I stay in the city I can\nalso press the matter forward better here.\" \"You're right,\" said his\nuncle in a tone that seemed to indicate they were finally coming closer\nto each other, \"I just made the suggestion because, as I saw it, if you\nstay in the city the case will be put in danger by your indifference to\nit, and I thought it was better if I did the work for you. But will you\npush things forward yourself with all your strength, if so, that will\nnaturally be far better.\" \"We're agreed then,\" said K. \"And do you have\nany suggestions for what I should do next?\" \"Well, naturally I'll have\nto think about it,\" said his uncle, \"you must bear in mind that I've\nbeen living in the country for twenty years now, almost without a\nbreak, you lose your ability to deal with matters like this. But I do\nhave some important connections with several people who, I expect, know\ntheir way around these things better than I do, and to contact them is a\nmatter of course. Out there in the country I've been getting out of\ncondition, I'm sure you're already aware of that. It's only at times\nlike this that you notice it yourself. And this affair of yours came\nlargely unexpected, although, oddly enough, I had expected something of\nthe sort after I'd read Erna's letter, and today when I saw your face I\nknew it with almost total certainty. But all that is by the by, the\nimportant thing now is, we have no time to lose.\" Even while he was\nstill speaking, K.'s uncle had stood on tiptoe to summon a taxi and now\nhe pulled K. into the car behind himself as he called out an address to\nthe driver. \"We're going now to see Dr. Huld, the lawyer,\" he said, \"we\nwere at school together. I'm sure you know the name, don't you? No? Well\nthat is odd. He's got a very good reputation as a defence barrister and\nfor working with the poor. But I esteem him especially as someone you\ncan trust.\" \"It's alright with me, whatever you do,\" said K., although\nhe was made uneasy by the rushed and urgent way his uncle was dealing\nwith the matter. It was not very encouraging, as the accused, to be\ntaken to a lawyer for poor people. \"I didn't know,\" he said, \"that you\ncould take on a lawyer in matters like this.\" \"Well of course you can,\"\nsaid his uncle, \"that goes without saying. Why wouldn't you take on a\nlawyer? And now, so that I'm properly instructed in this matter, tell me\nwhat's been happening so far.\" K. instantly began telling his uncle\nabout what had been happening, holding nothing back--being completely\nopen with him was the only way that K. could protest at his uncle's\nbelief that the trial was a great disgrace. He mentioned Miss B\u00fcrstner's\nname just once and in passing, but that did nothing to diminish his\nopenness about the trial as Miss B\u00fcrstner had no connection with it. As\nhe spoke, he looked out the window and saw how, just then, they were\ngetting closer to the suburb where the court offices were. He drew this\nto his uncle's attention, but he did not find the coincidence especially\nremarkable. The taxi stopped in front of a dark building.

K. and his uncle confirmed to each other the fact\nthat they had seen the two eyes. \"A new maid, afraid of strangers,\" said\nK.'s uncle, and knocked again. The eyes appeared once more. This time\nthey seemed almost sad, but the open gas flame that burned with a hiss\nclose above their heads gave off little light and that may have merely\ncreated an illusion. \"Open the door,\" called K.'s uncle, raising his\nfist against it, \"we are friends of Dr. Huld, the lawyer!\" \"Dr. Huld is\nill,\" whispered someone behind them. In a doorway at the far end of a\nnarrow passage stood a man in his dressing gown, giving them this\ninformation in an extremely quiet voice. K.'s uncle, who had already\nbeen made very angry by the long wait, turned abruptly round and\nretorted, \"Ill. You say he's ill?\" and strode towards the gentleman in a\nway that seemed almost threatening, as if he were the illness himself.\n\"They've opened the door for you, now,\" said the gentleman, pointing at\nthe door of the lawyer. He pulled his dressing gown together and\ndisappeared. The door had indeed been opened, a young girl--K.\nrecognised the dark, slightly bulging eyes--stood in the hallway in a\nlong white apron, holding a candle in her hand. \"Next time, open up\nsooner!\" said K.'s uncle instead of a greeting, while the girl made a\nslight curtsey. \"Come along, Josef,\" he then said to K. who was slowly\nmoving over towards the girl. \"Dr. Huld is unwell,\" said the girl as\nK.'s uncle, without stopping, rushed towards one of the doors. K.\ncontinued to look at the girl in amazement as she turned round to block\nthe way into the living room, she had a round face like a puppy's, not\nonly the pale cheeks and the chin were round but the temples and the\nhairline were too. \"Josef!\" called his uncle once more, and he asked the\ngirl, \"It's trouble with his heart, is it?\" \"I think it is, sir,\" said\nthe girl, who by now had found time to go ahead with the candle and open\nthe door into the room. In one corner of the room, where the light of\nthe candle did not reach, a face with a long beard looked up from the\nbed. \"Leni, who's this coming in?\" asked the lawyer, unable to recognise\nhis guests because he was dazzled by the candle. \"It's your old friend,\nAlbert,\" said K.'s uncle. \"Oh, Albert,\" said the lawyer, falling back\nonto his pillow as if this visit meant he would not need to keep up\nappearances. \"Is it really as bad as that?\" asked K.'s uncle, sitting on\nthe edge of the bed. \"I don't believe it is. It's a recurrence of your\nheart trouble and it'll pass over like the other times.\" \"Maybe,\" said\nthe lawyer quietly, \"but it's just as much trouble as it's ever been. I\ncan hardly breathe, I can't sleep at all and I'm getting weaker by the\nday.\" \"I see,\" said K.'s uncle, pressing his panama hat firmly against\nhis knee with his big hand. \"That is bad news. But are you getting the\nright sort of care? And it's so depressing in here, it's so dark. It's a\nlong time since I was last here, but it seemed to me friendlier then.\nEven your young lady here doesn't seem to have much life in her, unless\nshe's just pretending.\" The maid was still standing by the door with the\ncandle; as far as could be made out, she was watching K. more than she\nwas watching his uncle even while the latter was still speaking about\nher. K. leant against a chair that he had pushed near to the girl. \"When\nyou're as ill as I am,\" said the lawyer, \"you need to have peace. I\ndon't find it depressing.\" After a short pause he added, \"and Leni looks\nafter me well, she's a good girl.\" But that was not enough to persuade\nK.'s uncle, he had visibly taken against his friend's carer and, even\nthough he did not contradict the invalid, he persecuted her with his\nscowl as she went over to the bed, put the candle on the bedside table\nand, leaning over the bed, made a fuss of him by tidying the pillows.\nK.'s uncle nearly forgot the need to show any consideration for the man\nwho lay ill in bed, he stood up, walked up and down behind the carer,\nand K. would not have been surprised if he had grabbed hold of her\nskirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed. K. himself looked\non calmly, he was not even disappointed at finding the lawyer unwell,\nhe had been able to do nothing to oppose the enthusiasm his uncle had\ndeveloped for the matter, he was glad that this enthusiasm had now been\ndistracted without his having to do anything about it. His uncle,\nprobably simply wishing to be offensive to the lawyer's attendant, then\nsaid, \"Young lady, now please leave us alone for a while, I have some\npersonal matters to discuss with my friend.\" Dr. Huld's carer was still\nleant far over the invalid's bed and smoothing out the cloth covering\nthe wall next to it, she merely turned her head and then, in striking\ncontrast with the anger that first stopped K.'s uncle from speaking and\nthen let the words out in a gush, she said very quietly, \"You can see\nthat Dr. Huld is so ill that he can't discuss any matters at all.\" It\nwas probably just for the sake of convenience that she had repeated the\nwords spoken by K.'s uncle, but an onlooker might even have perceived\nit as mocking him and he, of course, jumped up as if he had just been\nstabbed. \"You damned ...,\" in the first gurglings of his excitement his\nwords could hardly be understood, K. was startled even though he had\nbeen expecting something of the sort and ran to his uncle with the\nintention, no doubt, of closing his mouth with both his hands.\nFortunately, though, behind the girl, the invalid raised himself up,\nK.'s uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting and\nthen, somewhat calmer, said, \"We have naturally not lost our senses,\nnot yet; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking\nfor it. Now please, go!\" The carer stood up straight by the bed\ndirectly facing K.'s uncle, K. thought he noticed that with one hand she\nwas stroking the lawyer's hand. \"You can say anything in front of\nLeni,\" said the invalid, in a tone that was unmistakably imploring.\n\"It's not my business,\" said K.'s uncle, \"and it's not my secrets.\" And\nhe twisted himself round as if wanting to go into no more negotiations\nbut giving himself a little more time to think. \"Whose business is it\nthen?\" asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again.\n\"My nephew's,\" said K.'s uncle, \"and I've brought him along with me.\"\nAnd he introduced him, \"Chief Clerk Josef K.\" \"Oh!\" said the invalid,\nnow with much more life in him, and reached out his hand towards K. \"Do\nforgive me, I didn't notice you there at all.\" Then he then said to his\ncarer, \"Leni, go,\" stretching his hand out to her as if this were a\nfarewell that would have to last for a long time. This time the girl\noffered no resistance. \"So you,\" he finally said to K.'s uncle, who had\nalso calmed down and stepped closer, \"you haven't come to visit me\nbecause I'm ill but you've come on business.\" The lawyer now looked so\nmuch stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was\nill had somehow made him weak, he remained supporting himself on one\nelbow, which must have been rather tiring, and continually pulled at a\nlock of hair in the middle of his beard. \"You already look much better,\"\nsaid K.'s uncle, \"now that that witch has gone outside.\" He interrupted\nhimself, whispered, \"I bet you she's listening!\" and sprang over to the\ndoor. But behind the door there was no-one, K.'s uncle came back not\ndisappointed, as her not listening seemed to him worse than if she had\nbeen, but probably somewhat embittered. \"You're mistaken about her,\"\nsaid the lawyer, but did nothing more to defend her; perhaps that was\nhis way of indicating that she did not need defending. But in a tone\nthat was much more committed he went on, \"As far as your nephew's\naffairs are concerned, this will be an extremely difficult undertaking\nand I'd count myself lucky if my strength lasted out long enough for it;\nI'm greatly afraid it won't do, but anyway I don't want to leave\nanything untried; if I don't last out you can always get somebody else.\nTo be honest, this matter interests me too much, and I can't bring\nmyself to give up the chance of taking some part in it. If my heart does\ntotally give out then at least it will have found a worthy affair to\nfail in.\" K. believed he understood not a word of this entire speech, he\nlooked at his uncle for an explanation but his uncle sat on the bedside\ntable with the candle in his hand, a medicine bottle had rolled off the\ntable onto the floor, he nodded to everything the lawyer said, agreed to\neverything, and now and then looked at K. urging him to show the same\ncompliance. Maybe K.'s uncle had already told the lawyer about the\ntrial. But that was impossible, everything that had happened so far\nspoke against it. So he said, \"I don't understand....\" \"Well, maybe I've\nmisunderstood what you've been saying,\" said the lawyer, just as\nastonished and embarrassed as K. \"Perhaps I've been going too fast. What\nwas it you wanted to speak to me about? I thought it was to do with your\ntrial.\" \"Of course it is,\" said K.'s uncle, who then asked K., \"So what\nis it you want?\" \"Yes, but how is it that you know anything about me and\nmy case?\" asked K. \"Oh, I see,\" said the lawyer with a smile. \"I am a\nlawyer, I move in court circles, people talk about various different\ncases and the more interesting ones stay in your mind, especially when\nthey concern the nephew of a friend. There's nothing very remarkable\nabout that.\" \"What is it you want, then?\" asked K.'s uncle once more,\n\"You seem so uneasy about it.\" \"You move in this court's circles?\" asked\nK. \"Yes,\" said the lawyer. \"You're asking questions like a child,\" said\nK.'s uncle. \"What circles should I move in, then, if not with members of\nmy own discipline?\" the lawyer added. It sounded so indisputable that K.\ngave no answer at all. \"But you work in the High Court, not that court\nin the attic,\" he had wanted to say but could not bring himself to\nactually utter it. \"You have to realise,\" the lawyer continued, in a\ntone as if he were explaining something obvious, unnecessary and\nincidental, \"you have to realise that I also derive great advantage for\nmy clients from mixing with those people, and do so in many different\nways, it's not something you can keep talking about all the time. I'm at\na bit of a disadvantage now, of course, because of my illness, but I\nstill get visits from some good friends of mine at the court and I learn\none or two things. It might even be that I learn more than many of those\nwho are in the best of health and spend all day in court. And I'm\nreceiving a very welcome visit right now, for instance.\" And he pointed\ninto a dark corner of the room. \"Where?\" asked K., almost uncouth in\nhis surprise. He looked round uneasily; the little candle gave off far\ntoo little light to reach as far as the wall opposite. And then,\nsomething did indeed begin to move there in the corner. In the light of\nthe candle held up by K.'s uncle an elderly gentleman could be seen\nsitting beside a small table. He had been sitting there for so long\nwithout being noticed that he could hardly have been breathing. Now he\nstood up with a great deal of fuss, clearly unhappy that attention had\nbeen drawn to him. It was as if, by flapping his hands about like short\nwings, he hoped to deflect any introductions and greetings, as if he\nwanted on no account to disturb the others by his presence and seemed to\nbe exhorting them to leave him back in the dark and forget about his\nbeing there. That, however, was something that could no longer be\ngranted him. \"You took us by surprise, you see,\" said the lawyer in\nexplanation, cheerfully indicating to the gentleman that he should come\ncloser, which, slowly, hesitatingly, looking all around him, but with a\ncertain dignity, he did. \"The office director--oh, yes, forgive me, I\nhaven't introduced you--this is my friend Albert K., this is his nephew,\nthe chief clerk Josef K., and this is the office director--so, the\noffice director was kind enough to pay me a visit. It's only possible\nto appreciate just how valuable a visit like this is if you've been let\ninto the secret of what a pile of work the office director has heaped\nover him. Well, he came anyway, we were having a peaceful chat, as far\nas I was able when I'm so weak, and although we hadn't told Leni she\nmustn't let anyone in as we weren't expecting anyone, we still would\nrather have remained alone, but then along came you, Albert, thumping\nyour fists on the door, the office director moved over into the corner\npulling his table and chair with him, but now it turns out we might\nhave, that is, if that's what you wish, we might have something to\ndiscuss with each other and it would be good if we can all come back\ntogether again.--Office director ...,\" he said with his head on one\nside, pointing with a humble smile to an armchair near the bed. \"I'm\nafraid I'll only be able to stay a few minutes more,\" smiled the office\ndirector as he spread himself out in the armchair and looked at the\nclock. \"Business calls. But I wouldn't want to miss the chance of\nmeeting a friend of my friend.\" He inclined his head slightly toward\nK.'s uncle, who seemed very happy with his new acquaintance, but he was\nnot the sort of person to express his feelings of deference and\nresponded to the office director's words with embarrassed, but loud,\nlaughter. A horrible sight! K. was able to quietly watch everything as\nnobody paid any attention to him, the office director took over as\nleader of the conversation as seemed to be his habit once he had been\ncalled forward, the lawyer listened attentively with his hand to his\near, his initial weakness having perhaps only had the function of\ndriving away his new visitors. K.'s uncle served as\ncandle-bearer--balancing the candle on his thigh while the office\ndirector frequently glanced nervously at it--and was soon free of his\nembarrassment and was quickly enchanted not only by the office\ndirector's speaking manner but also by the gentle, waving\nhand-movements with which he accompanied it. K., leaning against the\nbedpost, was totally ignored by the office director, perhaps\ndeliberately, and served the old man only as audience. And besides, he\nhad hardly any idea what the conversation was about and his thoughts\nsoon turned to the care assistant and the ill treatment she had suffered\nfrom his uncle. Soon after, he began to wonder whether he had not seen\nthe office director somewhere before, perhaps among the people who were\nat his first hearing. He may have been mistaken, but thought the office\ndirector might well have been among the old gentlemen with the thin\nbeards in the first row.\nThere was then a noise that everyone heard from the hallway as if\nsomething of porcelain were being broken. \"I'll go and see what's\nhappened,\" said K., who slowly left the room as if giving the others\nthe chance to stop him. He had hardly stepped into the hallway, finding\nhis bearings in the darkness with his hand still firmly holding the\ndoor, when another small hand, much smaller than K.'s own, placed itself\non his and gently shut the door. It was the carer who had been waiting\nthere. \"Nothing has happened,\" she whispered to him, \"I just threw a\nplate against the wall to get you out of there.\" \"I was thinking about\nyou, as well,\" replied K. uneasily. \"So much the better,\" said the\ncarer. \"Come with me.\" A few steps along, they came to a frosted glass\ndoor which the carer opened for him. \"Come in here,\" she said. It was\nclearly the lawyer's office, fitted out with old, heavy furniture, as\nfar as could be seen in the moonlight which now illuminated just a\nsmall, rectangular section of the floor by each of the three big\nwindows. \"This way,\" said the carer, pointing to a dark trunk with a\ncarved, wooden backrest. When he had sat down, K. continued to look\nround the room, it was a large room with a high ceiling, the clients of\nthis lawyer for the poor must have felt quite lost in it. K. thought he\ncould see the little steps with which visitors would approach the\nmassive desk. But then he forgot about all of this and had eyes only\nfor the carer who sat very close beside him, almost pressing him against\nthe armrest. \"I did think,\" she said, \"you would come out here to me by\nyourself without me having to call you first. It was odd. First you\nstare at me as soon as you come in, and then you keep me waiting. And\nyou ought to call me Leni, too,\" she added quickly and suddenly, as if\nno moment of this conversation should be lost. \"Gladly,\" said K. \"But\nas for its being odd, Leni, that's easy to explain. Firstly, I had to\nlisten to what the old men were saying and couldn't leave without a\ngood reason, but secondly I'm not a bold person, if anything I'm quite\nshy, and you, Leni, you didn't really look like you could be won over in\none stroke, either.\" \"That's not it,\" said Leni, laying one arm on the\narmrest and looking at K., \"you didn't like me, and I don't suppose you\nlike me now, either.\" \"Liking wouldn't be very much,\" said K.,\nevasively. \"Oh!\" she exclaimed with a smile, thus making use of K.'s\ncomment to gain an advantage over him. So K. remained silent for a\nwhile. By now, he had become used to the darkness in the room and was\nable to make out various fixtures and fittings. He was especially\nimpressed by a large picture hanging to the right of the door, he leant\nforward in order to see it better. It depicted a man wearing a judge's\nrobes; he was sitting on a lofty throne gilded in a way that shone\nforth from the picture. The odd thing about the picture was that this\njudge was not sitting there in dignified calm but had his left arm\npressed against the back and armrest, his right arm, however, was\ncompletely free and only grasped the armrest with his hand, as if about\nto jump up any moment in vigorous outrage and make some decisive comment\nor even to pass sentence. The accused was probably meant to be imagined\nat the foot of the steps, the top one of which could be seen in the\npicture, covered with a yellow carpet. \"That might be my judge,\" said\nK., pointing to the picture with one finger. \"I know him,\" said Leni\nlooking up at the picture, \"he comes here quite often. That picture is\nfrom when he was young, but he can never have looked anything like it,\nas he's tiny, minute almost. But despite that, he had himself made to\nlook bigger in the picture as he's madly vain, just like everyone round\nhere. But even I'm vain and that makes me very unhappy that you don't\nlike me.\" K. replied to that last comment merely by embracing Leni and\ndrawing her towards him, she lay her head quietly on his shoulder. To\nthe rest of it, though, he said, \"What rank is he?\" \"He's an examining\njudge,\" she said, taking hold of the hand with which K. held her and\nplaying with his fingers. \"Just an examining judge once again,\" said K.\nin disappointment, \"the senior officials keep themselves hidden. But\nhere he is sitting on a throne.\" \"That's all just made up,\" said Leni\nwith her face bent over K.'s hand, \"really he's sitting on a kitchen\nchair with an old horse blanket folded over it. But do you have to be\nalways thinking about your trial?\" she added slowly. \"No, not at all,\"\nsaid K., \"I probably even think too little about it.\" \"That's not the\nmistake you're making,\" said Leni, \"you're too unyielding, that's what\nI've heard.\" \"Who said that?\" asked K., he felt her body against his\nchest and looked down on her rich, dark, tightly-bound hair. \"I'd be\nsaying too much if I told you that,\" answered Leni. \"Please don't ask\nfor names, but do stop making these mistakes of yours, stop being so\nunyielding, there's nothing you can do to defend yourself from this\ncourt, you have to confess. So confess to them as soon as you get the\nchance. It's only then that they give you the chance to get away, not\ntill then. Only, without help from outside even that's impossible, but\nyou needn't worry about getting this help as I want to help you\nmyself.\" \"You understand a lot about this court and what sort of tricks\nare needed,\" said K. as he lifted her, since she was pressing in much\ntoo close to him, onto his lap. \"That's alright, then,\" she said, and\nmade herself comfortable on his lap by smoothing out her skirt and\nadjusting her blouse. Then she hung both her arms around his neck, leant\nback and took a long look at him. \"And what if I don't confess, could\nyou not help me then?\" asked K. to test her out. I'm accumulating women\nto help me, he thought to himself almost in amazement, first Miss\nB\u00fcrstner, then the court usher's wife, and now this little care\nassistant who seems to have some incomprehensible need for me. The way\nshe sits on my lap as if it were her proper place! \"No,\" answered Leni,\nslowly shaking her head, \"I couldn't help you then. But you don't want\nmy help anyway, it means nothing to you, you're too stubborn and won't\nbe persuaded.\" Then, after a while she asked, \"Do you have a lover?\"\n\"No,\" said K. \"Oh, you must have,\" she said. \"Well, I have really,\" said\nK. \"Just think, I've even betrayed her while I'm carrying her photograph\nwith me.\" Leni insisted he show her a photograph of Elsa, and then,\nhunched on his lap, studied the picture closely. The photograph was not\none that had been taken while Elsa was posing for it, it showed her just\nafter she had been in a wild dance such as she liked to do in wine bars,\nher skirt was still flung out as she span round, she had placed her\nhands on her firm hips and, with her neck held taut, looked to one side\nwith a laugh; you could not see from the picture whom her laugh was\nintended for. \"She's very tightly laced,\" said Leni, pointing to the\nplace where she thought this could be seen. \"I don't like her, she's\nclumsy and crude. But maybe she's gentle and friendly towards you,\nthat's the impression you get from the picture. Big, strong girls like\nthat often don't know how to be anything but gentle and friendly. Would\nshe be capable of sacrificing herself for you, though?\" \"No,\" said K.,\n\"she isn't gentle or friendly, and nor would she be capable of\nsacrificing herself for me. But I've never yet asked any of those things\nof her. I've never looked at this picture as closely as you.\" \"You can't\nthink much of her, then,\" said Leni. \"She can't be your lover after\nall.\" \"Yes she is,\" said K., \"I'm not going to take my word back on\nthat.\" \"Well she might be your lover now, then,\" said Leni, \"but you\nwouldn't miss her much if you lost her or if you exchanged her for\nsomebody else, me for instance.\" \"That is certainly conceivable,\" said\nK. with a smile, \"but she does have one major advantage over you, she\nknows nothing about my trial, and even if she did she wouldn't think\nabout it. She wouldn't try to persuade me to be less unyielding.\" \"Well\nthat's no advantage,\" said Leni. \"If she's got no advantage other than\nthat, I can keep on hoping. Has she got any bodily defects?\" \"'Bodily\ndefects'?\" asked K. \"Yeah,\" said Leni, \"as I do have a bodily defect,\njust a little one. Look.\" She spread the middle and ring fingers of her\nright hand apart from each other. Between those fingers the flap of skin\nconnecting them reached up almost as far as the top joint of the little\nfinger. In the darkness, K. did not see at first what it was she wanted\nto show him, so she led his hand to it so that he could feel. \"What a\nfreak of nature,\" said K., and when he had taken a look at the whole\nhand he added, \"What a pretty claw!\" Leni looked on with a kind of pride\nas K. repeatedly opened and closed her two fingers in amazement, until,\nfinally, he briefly kissed them and let go. \"Oh!\" she immediately\nexclaimed, \"you kissed me!\" Hurriedly, and with her mouth open, she\nclambered up K.'s lap with her knees. He was almost aghast as he looked\nup at her, now that she was so close to him there was a bitter,\nirritating smell from her, like pepper, she grasped his head, leant out\nover him, and bit and kissed his neck, even biting into his hair. \"I've\ntaken her place!\" she exclaimed from time to time. \"Just look, now\nyou've taken me instead of her!\" Just then, her knee slipped out and,\nwith a little cry, she nearly fell down onto the carpet, K. tried to\nhold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down with her.\n\"Now you're mine,\" she said. Her last words to him as he left were,\n\"Here's the key to the door, come whenever you want,\" and she planted an\nundirected kiss on his back. When he stepped out the front door there\nwas a light rain falling, he was about to go to the middle of the street\nto see if he could still glimpse Leni at the window when K.'s uncle\nleapt out of a car that K., thinking of other things, had not seen\nwaiting outside the building. He took hold of K. by both arms and shoved\nhim against the door as if he wanted to nail him to it. \"Young man,\" he\nshouted, \"how could you do a thing like that?! Things were going well\nwith this business of yours, now you've caused it terrible damage. You\nslip off with some dirty, little thing who, moreover, is obviously the\nlawyer's beloved, and stay away for hours. You don't even try to find an\nexcuse, don't try to hide anything, no, you're quite open about it, you\nrun off with her and stay there. And meanwhile we're sitting there, your\nuncle who's going to such effort for you, the lawyer who needs to be won\nover to your side, and above all the office director, a very important\ngentleman who is in direct command of your affair in its present stage.\nWe wanted to discuss how best to help you, I had to handle the lawyer",

            "text": "Lawyer--Manufacturer--Painter\nOne winter morning--snow was falling in the dull light outside--K. was\nsitting in his office, already extremely tired despite the early hour.\nHe had told the servitor he was engaged in a major piece of work and\nnone of the junior staff should be allowed in to see him, so he would\nnot be disturbed by them at least. But instead of working he turned\nround in his chair, slowly moved various items around his desk, but\nthen, without being aware of it, he lay his arm stretched out on the\ndesk top and sat there immobile with his head sunk down on his chest.\nHe was no longer able to get the thought of the trial out of his head.\nHe had often wondered whether it might not be a good idea to work out a\nwritten defence and hand it in to the court. It would contain a short\ndescription of his life and explain why he had acted the way he had at\neach event that was in any way important, whether he now considered he\nhad acted well or ill, and his reasons for each. There was no doubt of\nthe advantages a written defence of this sort would have over relying\non the lawyer, who was anyway not without his shortcomings. K. had no\nidea what actions the lawyer was taking; it was certainly not a lot, it\nwas more than a month since the lawyer had summoned him, and none of\nthe previous discussions had given K. the impression that this man would\nbe able to do much for him. Most importantly, he had asked him hardly\nany questions. And there were so many questions here to be asked.\nAsking questions was the most important thing. K. had the feeling that\nhe would be able to ask all the questions needed here himself. The\nlawyer, in contrast, did not ask questions but did all the talking\nhimself or sat silently facing him, leant forward slightly over the\ndesk, probably because he was hard of hearing, pulled on a strand of\nhair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet, perhaps\nat the very spot where K. had lain with Leni. Now and then he would give\nK. some vague warning of the sort you give to children. His speeches\nwere as pointless as they were boring, and K. decided that when the\nfinal bill came he would pay not a penny for them. Once the lawyer\nthought he had humiliated K. sufficiently, he usually started something\nthat would raise his spirits again. He had already, he would then say,\nwon many such cases, partly or in whole, cases which may not really have\nbeen as difficult as this one but which, on the face of it, had even\nless hope of success. He had a list of these cases here in the\ndrawer--here he would tap on one or other of the drawers in his\ndesk--but could, unfortunately, not show them to K. as they dealt with\nofficial secrets. Nonetheless, the great experience he had acquired\nthrough all these cases would, of course, be of benefit to K. He had, of\ncourse, begun work straight away and was nearly ready to submit the\nfirst documents. They would be very important because the first\nimpression made by the defence will often determine the whole course of\nthe proceedings. Unfortunately, though, he would still have to make it\nclear to K. that the first documents submitted are sometimes not even\nread by the court. They simply put them with the other documents and\npoint out that, for the time being, questioning and observing the\naccused are much more important than anything written. If the applicant\nbecomes insistent, then they add that before they come to any decision,\nas soon as all the material has been brought together, with due regard,\nof course, to all the documents, then these first documents to have been\nsubmitted will also be checked over. But unfortunately, even this is not\nusually true, the first documents submitted are usually mislaid or lost\ncompletely, and even if they do keep them right to the end they are\nhardly read, although the lawyer only knew about this from rumour. This\nis all very regrettable, but not entirely without its justifications.\nBut K. should not forget that the trial would not be public, if the\ncourt deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that\nsays it has to be. As a result, the accused and his defence don't have\naccess even to the court records, and especially not to the indictment,\nand that means we generally don't know--or at least not precisely--what\nthe first documents need to be about, which means that if they do\ncontain anything of relevance to the case it's only by a lucky\ncoincidence. If anything about the individual charges and the reasons\nfor them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused is\nbeing questioned, then it's possible to work out and submit documents\nthat really direct the issue and present proof, but not before.\nConditions like this, of course, place the defence in a very\nunfavourable and difficult position. But that is what they intend. In\nfact, defence is not really allowed under the law, it's only tolerated,\nand there is even some dispute about whether the relevant parts of the\nlaw imply even that. So strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a\ncounsel acknowledged by the court, and anyone who comes before this\ncourt as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer. The\neffect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the whole\nprocedure, the next time K. is in the court offices he might like to\nhave a look in at the lawyers' room, just so that he's seen it. He might\nwell be quite shocked by the people he sees assembled there. The room\nthey've been allocated, with its narrow space and low ceiling, will be\nenough to show what contempt the court has for these people. The only\nlight in the room comes through a little window that is so high up that,\nif you want to look out of it, you first have to get one of your\ncolleagues to support you on his back, and even then the smoke from the\nchimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face\nblack. In the floor of this room--to give yet another example of the\nconditions there--there is a hole that's been there for more than a\nyear, it's not so big that a man could fall through, but it is big\nenough for your foot to disappear through it. The lawyers' room is on\nthe second floor of the attic; if your foot does go through it will hang\ndown into the first floor of the attic underneath it, and right in the\ncorridor where the litigants are waiting. It's no exaggeration when\nlawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace. Complaints to the\nmanagement don't have the slightest effect, but the lawyers are strictly\nforbidden to alter anything in the room at their own expense. But even\ntreating the lawyers in this way has its reasons. They want, as far as\npossible, to prevent any kind of defence, everything should be made the\nresponsibility of the accused. Not a bad point of view, basically, but\nnothing could be more mistaken than to think from that that lawyers are\nnot necessary for the accused in this court. On the contrary, there is\nno court where they are less needed than here. This is because\nproceedings are generally kept secret not only from the public but also\nfrom the accused. Only as far as that is possible, of course, but it is\npossible to a very large extent. And the accused doesn't get to see the\ncourt records either, and it's very difficult to infer what's in the\ncourt records from what's been said during questioning based on them,\nespecially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is faced\nwith every possible worry to distract him. This is when the defence\nbegins. Counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be present\nwhile the accused is being questioned, so afterwards, and if possible\nstill at the door of the interview room, he has to learn what he can\nabout it from him and extract whatever he can that might be of use, even\nthough what the accused has to report is often very confused. But that\nis not the most important thing, as there's really not a lot that can be\nlearned in this way, although in this, as with anything else, a\ncompetent man will learn more than another. Nonetheless, the most\nimportant thing is the lawyer's personal connections, that's where the\nreal value of taking counsel lies. Now K. will most likely have already\nlearned from his own experience that, among its very lowest orders, the\ncourt organisation does have its imperfections, the court is strictly\nclosed to the public, but staff who forget their duty or who take bribes\ndo, to some extent, show where the gaps are. This is where most lawyers\nwill push their way in, this is where bribes are paid and information\nextracted, there have even, in earlier times at least, been incidents\nwhere documents have been stolen. There's no denying that some\nsurprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused in\nthis way, for a limited time, and these petty advocates then strut to\nand fro on the basis of them and attract new clients, but for the\nfurther course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing\ngood. The only things of real value are honest personal contacts,\ncontacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower\ngrades, you understand. That is the only way the progress of the trial\ncan be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it's true, but from then\non it becomes more and more visible. There are, of course, not many\nlawyers who can do this, and K. has made a very good choice in this\nmatter. There were probably no more than one or two who had as many\ncontacts as Dr. Huld, but they don't bother with the company of the\nlawyers' room and have nothing to do with it. This means they have all\nthe less contact with the court officials. It is not at all necessary\nfor Dr. Huld to go to the court, wait in the ante-rooms for the\nexamining judges to turn up, if they turn up, and try to achieve\nsomething which, according to the judges' mood is usually more apparent\nthan real and most often not even that. No, K. has seen for himself that\nthe court officials, including some who are quite high up, come forward\nwithout being asked, are glad to give information which is fully open or\nat least easy to understand, they discuss the next stages in the\nproceedings, in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quite\nwilling to adopt the other person's point of view. However, when this\nhappens, you should never trust them too far, as however firmly they may\nhave declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant they\nmight well go straight back to their offices and write a report for the\ncourt that says just the opposite, and might well be even harder on the\ndefendant than the original view, the one they insist they've been fully\ndissuaded from. And, of course, there's no way of defending yourself\nfrom this, something said in private is indeed in private and cannot\nthen be used in public, it's not something that makes it easy for the\ndefence to keep those gentlemen's favour. On the other hand, it's also\ntrue that the gentlemen don't become involved with the defence--which\nwill of course be done with great expertise--just for philanthropic\nreasons or in order to be friendly, in some respects it would be truer\nto say that they, too, have it allocated to them. This is where the\ndisadvantages of a court structure that, right from the start,\nstipulates that all proceedings take place in private, come into force.\nIn normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public,\nand they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normal\ntrials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudge\nhere and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especially\ndifficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are very\nsimple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, with\ntheir laws, and so they don't have the right feel for human\nrelationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this.\nThat's when they come for advice to the lawyer, with a servant behind\nthem carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret. You could\nhave seen many gentlemen at this window, gentlemen of whom you would\nleast expect it, staring out this window in despair on the street below\nwhile the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he can\ngive them good advice. And at times like that it's also possible to see\nhow exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions and\nhow they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it's just\nnot in their natures to overcome. But they're not in an easy position,\nto regard their positions as easy would be to do them an injustice. The\ndifferent ranks and hierarchies of the court are endless, and even\nsomeone who knows his way around them cannot always tell what's going to\nhappen. But even for the junior officials, the proceedings in the\ncourtrooms are usually kept secret, so they are hardly able to see how\nthe cases they work with proceed, court affairs appear in their range of\nvision often without their knowing where they come from and they move on\nfurther without their learning where they go. So civil servants like\nthis are not able to learn the things you can learn from studying the\nsuccessive stages that individual trials go through, the final verdict\nor the reasons for it. They're only allowed to deal with that part of\nthe trial which the law allocates them, and they usually know less about\nthe results of their work after it's left them than the defence does,\neven though the defence will usually stay in contact with the accused\nuntil the trial is nearly at its end, so that the court officials can\nlearn many useful things from the defence. Bearing all this in mind,\ndoes it still surprise K. that the officials are irritated and often\nexpress themselves about the litigants in unflattering ways--which is an\nexperience shared by everyone. All the officials are irritated, even\nwhen they appear calm. This causes many difficulties for the junior\nadvocates, of course. There is a story, for instance, that has very much\nthe ring of truth about it. It goes like this: One of the older\nofficials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter\nfor the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the\ncontributions from the lawyers. He had been studying it for a day and a\nnight without a break--as these officials are indeed hard working,\nno-one works as hard as they do. When it was nearly morning, and he had\nbeen working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he\nwent to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a\nlawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps.\nThe lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed\nwith each other what they should do; on the one hand they had actually\nno right to be allowed into the building so that there was hardly\nanything that they could legally do to the official and, as I've already\nmentioned, they would have to be careful not to set all the officials\nagainst them. On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day\nlost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way\ninside. In the end, they agreed that they would try to tire the old man\nout. One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let\nhimself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long\nas it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the\nbottom of the steps. That went on for about an hour until the old\ngentleman, who was already exhausted from working all night, was very\ntired and went back to his office. Those who were at the bottom of the\nsteps could not believe it at first, so they sent somebody out to go and\nlook behind the door to see if there really was no-one there, and only\nthen did they all gather together and probably didn't even dare to\ncomplain, as it's far from being the lawyers' job to introduce any\nimprovements in the court system, or even to want to. Even the most\njunior lawyer can understand the relationship there to some extent, but\none significant point is that almost every defendant, even very simple\npeople, begins to think of suggestions for improving the court as soon\nas his proceedings have begun, many of them often even spend time and\nenergy on the matter that could be spent far better elsewhere. The only\nright thing to do is to learn how to deal with the situation as it is.\nEven if it were possible to improve any detail of it--which is anyway no\nmore than superstitious nonsense--the best that they could achieve,\nalthough doing themselves incalculable harm in the process, is that they\nwill have attracted the special attention of the officials for any case\nthat comes up in the future, and the officials are always ready to seek\nrevenge. Never attract attention to yourself! Stay calm, however much it\ngoes against your character! Try to gain some insight into the size of\nthe court organism and how, to some extent, it remains in a state of\nsuspension, and that even if you alter something in one place you'll\ndraw the ground out from under your feet and might fall, whereas if an\nenormous organism like the court is disrupted in any one place it finds\nit easy to provide a substitute for itself somewhere else. Everything is\nconnected with everything else and will continue without any change or\nelse, which is quite probable, even more closed, more attentive, more\nstrict, more malevolent. So it's best to leave the work to the lawyers\nand not to keep disturbing them. It doesn't do much good to make\naccusations, especially if you can't make it clear what they're based on\nand their full significance, but it must be said that K. caused a great\ndeal of harm to his own case by his behaviour towards the office\ndirector, he was a very influential man but now he might as well be\nstruck off the list of those who might do anything for K. If the trial\nis mentioned, even just in passing, it's quite obvious that he's\nignoring it. These officials are in many ways just like children. Often,\nsomething quite harmless--although K.'s behaviour could unfortunately\nnot be called harmless--will leave them feeling so offended that they\nwill even stop talking with good friends of theirs, they turn away when\nthey see them and do everything they can to oppose them. But then, with\nno particular reason, surprisingly enough, some little joke that was\nonly ever attempted because everything seemed so hopeless will make them\nlaugh and they'll be reconciled. It's both difficult and hard at the\nsame time to deal with them, and there's hardly any reason for it. It's\nsometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to\nencompass so much that it's at all possible ever to have any success in\none's work here. On the other hand, there are also dark moments, such as\neveryone has, when you think you've achieved nothing at all, when it\nseems that the only trials to come to a good end are those that were\ndetermined to have a good end from the start and would do so without any\nhelp, while all the others are lost despite all the running to and fro,\nall the effort, all the little, apparent successes that gave such joy.\nThen you no longer feel very sure of anything and, if asked about a\ntrial that was doing well by its own nature but which was turned for the\nworse because you assisted in it, would not even dare deny that. And\neven that is a kind of self-confidence, but then it's the only one\nthat's left. Lawyers are especially vulnerable to fits of depression of\nthat sort--and they are no more than fits of depression of course--when\na case is suddenly taken out of their hands after they've been\nconducting it satisfactorily for some time. That's probably the worst\nthat can happen to a lawyer. It's not that the accused takes the case\naway from him, that hardly ever happens, once a defendant has taken on\na certain lawyer he has to stay with him whatever happens. How could he\never carry on by himself after he's taken on help from a lawyer? No,\nthat just doesn't happen, but what does sometimes happen is that the\ntrial takes on a course where the lawyer may not go along with it.\nClient and trial are both simply taken away from the lawyer; and then\neven contact with the court officials won't help, however good they are,\nas they don't know anything themselves. The trial will have entered a\nstage where no more help can be given, where it's being processed in\ncourts to which no-one has any access, where the defendant cannot even\nbe contacted by his lawyer. You come home one day and find all the\ndocuments you've submitted, which you've worked hard to create and which\nyou had the best hopes for, lying on the desk, they've been sent back as\nthey can't be carried through to the next stage in the trial, they're\njust worthless scraps of paper. It doesn't mean that the case has been\nlost, not at all, or at least there is no decisive reason for supposing\nso, it's just that you don't know anything more about the case and won't\nbe told anything of what's happening. Well, cases like that are the\nexceptions, I'm glad to say, and even if K.'s trial is one of them, it's\nstill, for the time being, a long way off. But there was still plenty of\nopportunity for lawyers to get to work, and K. could be sure they would\nbe made use of. As he had said, the time for submitting documents was\nstill in the future and there was no rush to prepare them, it was much\nmore important to start the initial discussions with the appropriate\nofficials, and they had already taken place. With varying degrees of\nsuccess, it must be said. It was much better not to give away any\ndetails before their time, as in that way K. could only be influenced\nunfavourably and his hopes might be raised or he might be made too\nanxious, better just to say that some individuals have spoken very\nfavourably and shown themselves very willing to help, although others\nhave spoken less favourably, but even they have not in any way refused\nto help. So all in all, the results are very encouraging, only you\nshould certainly not draw any particular conclusions as all preliminary\nproceedings begin in the same way and it was only the way they developed\nfurther that would show what the value of these preliminary proceedings\nhas been. Anyway, nothing has been lost yet, and if we can succeed in\ngetting the office director, despite everything, on our side--and\nseveral actions have been undertaken to this end--then everything is a\nclean wound, as a surgeon would say, and we can wait for the results\nwith some comfort.\nWhen he started talking on in this way the lawyer was quite tireless.\nHe went through it all again every time K. went to see him. There was\nalways some progress, but he could never be told what sort of progress\nit was. The first set of documents to be submitted were being worked on\nbut still not ready, which usually turned out to be a great advantage\nthe next time K. went to see him as the earlier occasion would have\nbeen a very bad time to put them in, which they could not then have\nknown. If K., stupefied from all this talking, ever pointed out that\neven considering all these difficulties progress was very slow, the\nlawyer would object that progress was not slow at all, but that they\nmight have progressed far further if K. had come to him at the right\ntime. But he had come to him late and that lateness would bring still\nfurther difficulties, and not only where time was concerned. The only\nwelcome interruption during these visits was always when Leni contrived\nto bring the lawyer his tea while K. was there. Then she would stand\nbehind K.--pretending to watch the lawyer as he bent greedily over his\ncup, poured the tea in and drank--and secretly let K. hold her hand.\nThere was always complete silence. The lawyer drank. K. squeezed Leni's\nhand and Leni would sometimes dare to gently stroke K.'s hair. \"Still\nhere, are you?\" the lawyer would ask when he was ready. \"I wanted to\ntake the dishes away,\" said Leni, they would give each other's hands a\nfinal squeeze, the lawyer would wipe his mouth and then start talking at\nK. again with renewed energy.\nWas the lawyer trying to comfort K. or to confuse him? K. could not\ntell, but it seemed clear to him that his defence was not in good\nhands. Maybe everything the lawyer said was quite right, even though he\nobviously wanted to make himself as conspicuous as possible and\nprobably had never even taken on a case as important as he said K.'s\nwas. But it was still suspicious how he continually mentioned his\npersonal contacts with the civil servants. Were they to be exploited\nsolely for K.'s benefit. The lawyer never forgot to mention that they\nwere dealing only with junior officials, which meant officials who were\ndependent on others, and the direction taken in each trial could be\nimportant for their own furtherment. Could it be that they were making\nuse of the lawyer to turn trials in a certain direction, which would,\nof course, always be at the cost of the defendant. It certainly did not\nmean that they would do that in every trial, that was not likely at all,\nand there were probably also trials where they gave the lawyer\nadvantages and all the room he needed to turn it in the direction he\nwanted, as it would also be to their advantage to keep his reputation\nintact. If that really was their relationship, how would they direct\nK.'s trial which, as the lawyer had explained, was especially difficult\nand therefore important enough to attract great attention from the very\nfirst time it came to court? There could not be much doubt about what\nthey would do. The first signs of it could already be seen in the fact\nthat the first documents still had not been submitted even though the\ntrial had already lasted several months, and that, according to the\nlawyer, everything was still in its initial stages, which was very\neffective, of course, in making the defendant passive and keeping him\nhelpless. Then he could be suddenly surprised with the verdict, or at\nleast with a notification that the hearing had not decided in his favour\nand the matter would be passed on to a higher office.\nIt was essential that K. take a hand in it himself. On winter's\nmornings such as this, when he was very tired and everything dragged\nitself lethargically through his head, this belief of his seemed\nirrefutable. He no longer felt the contempt for the trial that he had\nhad earlier. If he had been alone in the world it would have been easy\nfor him to ignore it, although it was also certain that, in that case,\nthe trial would never have arisen in the first place. But now, his uncle\nhad already dragged him to see the lawyer, he had to take account of his\nfamily; his job was no longer totally separate from the progress of the\ntrial, he himself had carelessly--with a certain, inexplicable\ncomplacency--mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned about\nit in ways he did not know, his relationship with Miss B\u00fcrstner seemed\nto be in trouble because of it. In short, he no longer had any choice\nwhether he would accept the trial or turn it down, he was in the middle\nof it and had to defend himself. If he was tired, then that was bad.\nBut there was no reason to worry too much before he needed to. He had\nbeen capable of working himself up to his high position in the bank in\na relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone,\nnow he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that\npossible for him to the trial, and there was no doubt that it had to\nturn out well. The most important thing, if something was to be\nachieved, was to reject in advance any idea that he might be in any way\nguilty. There was no guilt. The trial was nothing but a big piece of\nbusiness, just like he had already concluded to the benefit of the bank\nmany times, a piece of business that concealed many lurking dangers\nwaiting in ambush for him, as they usually did, and these dangers would\nneed to be defended against. If that was to be achieved then he must not\nentertain any idea of guilt, whatever he did, he would need to look\nafter his own interests as closely as he could. Seen in this way, there\nwas no choice but to take his representation away from the lawyer very\nsoon, at best that very evening. The lawyer had told him, as he talked\nto him, that that was something unheard of and would probably do him a\ngreat deal of harm, but K. could not tolerate any impediment to his\nefforts where his trial was concerned, and these impediments were\nprobably caused by the lawyer himself. But once he had shaken off the\nlawyer the documents would need to be submitted straight away and, if\npossible, he would need to see to it that they were being dealt with\nevery day. It would of course not be enough, if that was to be done, for\nK. to sit in the corridor with his hat under the bench like the others.\nDay after day, he himself, or one of the women or somebody else on his\nbehalf, would have to run after the officials and force them to sit at\ntheir desks and study K.'s documents instead of looking out on the\ncorridor through the grating. There could be no let-up in these efforts,\neverything would need to be organised and supervised, it was about time\nthat the court came up against a defendant who knew how to defend and\nmake use of his rights.\nBut when K. had the confidence to try and do all this the difficulty of\ncomposing the documents was too much for him. Earlier, just a week or\nso before, he could only have felt shame at the thought of being made\nto write out such documents himself; it had never entered his head that\nthe task could also be difficult. He remembered one morning when,\nalready piled up with work, he suddenly shoved everything to one side\nand took a pad of paper on which he sketched out some of his thoughts on\nhow documents of this sort should proceed. Perhaps he would offer them\nto that slow-witted lawyer, but just then the door of the manager's\noffice opened and the deputy director entered the room with a loud\nlaugh. K. was very embarrassed, although the deputy director, of\ncourse, was not laughing at K.'s documents, which he knew nothing about,\nbut at a joke he had just heard about the stock-exchange, a joke which\nneeded an illustration if it was to be understood, and now the\ndeputy director leant over K.'s desk, took his pencil from his hand,\nand drew the illustration on the writing pad that K. had intended for\nhis ideas about his case.\nK. now had no more thoughts of shame, the documents had to be prepared\nand submitted. If, as was very likely, he could find no time to do it\nin the office he would have to do it at home at night. If the nights\nweren't enough he would have to take a holiday. Above all, he could not\nstop half way, that was nonsense not only in business but always and\neverywhere. Needless to say, the documents would mean an almost endless\namount of work. It was easy to come to the belief, not only for those\nof an anxious disposition, that it was impossible ever to finish it.\nThis was not because of laziness or deceit, which were the only things\nthat might have hindered the lawyer in preparing it, but because he did\nnot know what the charge was or even what consequences it might bring,\nso that he had to remember every tiny action and event from the whole\nof his life, looking at them from all sides and checking and\nreconsidering them. It was also a very disheartening job. It would have\nbeen more suitable as a way of passing the long days after he had\nretired and become senile. But now, just when K. needed to apply all his\nthoughts to his work, when he was still rising and already posed a\nthreat to the deputy director, when every hour passed so quickly and he\nwanted to enjoy the brief evenings and nights as a young man, this was\nthe time he had to start working out these documents. Once more, he\nbegan to feel resentment. Almost involuntarily, only to put an end to\nit, his finger felt for the button of the electric bell in the\nante-room. As he pressed it he glanced up to the clock. It was eleven\no'clock, two hours, he had spent a great deal of his costly time just\ndreaming and his wits were, of course, even more dulled than they had\nbeen before. But the time had, nonetheless, not been wasted, he had come\nto some decisions that could be of value. As well as various pieces of\nmail, the servitors brought two visiting cards from gentlemen who had\nalready been waiting for K. for some time. They were actually very\nimportant clients of the bank who should not really have been kept\nwaiting under any circumstances. Why had they come at such an awkward\ntime, and why, the gentlemen on the other side of the closed door seemed\nto be asking, was the industrious K. using up the best business time for\nhis private affairs? Tired from what had gone before, and tired in\nanticipation of what was to follow, K. stood up to receive the first of\nthem.\nHe was a short, jolly man, a manufacturer who K. knew well. He\napologised for disturbing K. at some important work, and K., for his\npart, apologised for having kept the manufacturer waiting for so long.\nBut even this apology was spoken in such a mechanical way and with such\nfalse intonation that the manufacturer would certainly have noticed if\nhe had not been fully preoccupied with his business affairs. Instead,\nhe hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets,\nspread them out in front of K., explained several items, corrected a\nlittle mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced\nover it all, and reminded K. of a similar piece of business he'd\nconcluded with him about a year before, mentioning in passing that this\ntime there was another bank spending great effort to get his business,\nand finally stopped speaking in order to learn K.'s opinion on the\nmatter. And K. had indeed, at first, been closely following what the\nmanufacturer was saying, he too was aware of how important the deal\nwas, but unfortunately it did not last, he soon stopped listening,\nnodded at each of the manufacturer's louder exclamations for a short\nwhile, but eventually he stopped doing even that and did no more than\nstare at the bald head bent over the papers, asking himself when the\nmanufacturer would finally realise that everything he was saying was\nuseless. When he did stop talking, K. really thought at first that this\nwas so that he would have the chance to confess that he was incapable of\nlistening. Instead, seeing the anticipation on the manufacturer's face,\nobviously ready to counter any objections made, he was sorry to realise\nthat the business discussion had to be continued. So he bent his head as\nif he'd been given an order and began slowly to move his pencil over the\npapers, now and then he would stop and stare at one of the figures. The\nmanufacturer thought there must be some objection, perhaps his figures\nweren't really sound, perhaps they weren't the decisive issue, whatever\nhe thought, the manufacturer covered the papers with his hand and began\nonce again, moving very close to K., to explain what the deal was all\nabout. \"It is difficult,\" said K., pursing his lips. The only thing\nthat could offer him any guidance were the papers, and the manufacturer\nhad covered them from his view, so he just sank back against the arm of\nthe chair. Even when the door of the manager's office opened and\nrevealed not very clearly, as if through a veil, the deputy director, he\ndid no more than look up weakly. K. thought no more about the matter, he\nmerely watched the immediate effect of the deputy director's appearance\nand, for him, the effect was very pleasing; the manufacturer\nimmediately jumped up from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputy\ndirector, although K. would have liked to make him ten times livelier as\nhe feared the deputy director might disappear again. He need not have\nworried, the two gentlemen met each other, shook each other's hand and\nwent together over to K.'s desk. The manufacturer said he was sorry to\nfind the chief clerk so little inclined to do business, pointing to K.\nwho, under the view of the deputy director, had bent back down over the\npapers. As the two men leant over the desk and the manufacturer made\nsome effort to gain and keep the deputy director's attention, K. felt as\nif they were much bigger than they really were and that their\nnegotiations were about him. Carefully and slowly turning his eyes\nupwards, he tried to learn what was taking place above him, took one of\nthe papers from his desk without looking to see what it was, lay it on\nthe flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the level\nof the two men himself. He had no particular plan in mind as he did\nthis, but merely felt this was how he would act if only he had finished\npreparing that great document that was to remove his burden entirely.\nThe deputy director had been paying all his attention to the\nconversation and did no more than glance at the paper, he did not read\nwhat was written on it at all as what was important for the chief clerk\nwas not important for him, he took it from K.'s hand saying, \"Thank you,\nI'm already familiar with everything,\" and laid it calmly back on the\ndesk. K. gave him a bitter, sideways look. But the deputy director did\nnot notice this at all, or if he did notice it it only raised his\nspirits, he frequently laughed out loud, one time he clearly embarrassed\nthe manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him\nimmediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on\nhimself, and finally invited him into his office where they could bring\nthe matter to its conclusion. \"It's a very important matter,\" said the\nmanufacturer. \"I understand that completely. And I'm sure the chief\nclerk ...\"--even as he said this he was actually speaking only to the\nmanufacturer--\"will be very glad to have us take it off his hands. This\nis something that needs calm consideration. But he seems to be\nover-burdened today, there are even some people in the room outside\nwho've been waiting there for hours for him.\" K. still had enough\ncontrol of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct his\nfriendly, albeit stiff, smile only at the manufacturer, he made no other\nretaliation, bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands on\nhis desk like a clerk, and watched as the two gentlemen, still talking,\ntook the papers from his desk and disappeared into the manager's office.\nIn the doorway, the manufacturer turned and said he wouldn't make his\nfarewell with K. just yet, he would of course let the chief clerk know\nabout the success of his discussions but he also had a little something\nto tell him about.\nAt last, K. was by himself. It did not enter his head to show anyone\nelse into his office and only became vaguely aware of how nice it was\nthat the people outside thought he was still negotiating with the\nmanufacturer and, for this reason, he could not let anyone in to see\nhim, not even the servitor. He went over to the window, sat down on the\nledge beside it, held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto the\nsquare outside. The snow was still falling, the weather still had not\nbrightened up at all.\nHe remained a long time sitting in this way, not knowing what it\nactually was that made him so anxious, only occasionally did he glance,\nslightly startled, over his shoulder at the door to the outer room\nwhere, mistakenly, he thought he'd heard some noise. No-one came, and\nthat made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed his\nface with cold water and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to his\nplace by the window. The decision to take his defence into his own\nhands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed. All\nthe while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had\nlittle basic affect on him, he had observed it from afar as something\nthat was scarcely able to reach him directly, when it suited him he\nlooked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his head\nback again whenever he wanted. Now, in contrast, if he was to conduct\nhis defence himself, he would have to devote himself entirely to the\ncourt--for the time being, at least--success would mean, later on, his\ncomplete and conclusive liberation, but if he was to achieve this he\nwould have to place himself, to start with, in far greater danger than\nhe had been in so far. If he ever felt tempted to doubt this, then his\nexperience with the deputy director and the manufacturer that day would\nbe quite enough to convince him of it. How could he have sat there\ntotally convinced of the need to do his own defence? How would it be\nlater? What would his life be like in the days ahead? Would he find the\nway through it all to a happy conclusion? Did a carefully worked out\ndefence--and any other sort would have made no sense--did a carefully\nworked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himself off from\neverything else as much as he could? Would he survive that? And how was\nhe to succeed in conducting all this at the bank? It involved much more\nthan just submitting some documents that he could probably prepare in a\nfew days' leave, although it would have been great temerity to ask for\ntime off from the bank just at that time, it was a whole trial and there\nwas no way of seeing how long it might last. This was an enormous\ndifficulty that had suddenly been thrown into K.'s life!\nAnd was he supposed to be doing the bank's work at a time like this? He\nlooked down at his desk. Was he supposed to let people in to see him\nand go into negotiations with them at a time like this? While his trial\ntrundled on, while the court officials upstairs in the attic room sat\nlooking at the papers for this trial, should he be worrying about the\nbusiness of the bank? Did this not seem like a kind of torture,\nacknowledged by the court, connected with the trial and which followed\nhim around? And is it likely that anyone in the bank, when judging his\nwork, would take any account of his peculiar situation? No-one and\nnever. There were those who knew about his trial, although it was not\nquite clear who knew about it or how much. But he hoped rumours had not\nreached as far as the deputy director, otherwise he would obviously\nsoon find a way of making use of it to harm K., he would show neither\ncomradeship nor humaneness. And what about the director? It was true\nthat he was well disposed towards K., and as soon as he heard about the\ntrial he would probably try to do everything he could to make it easier\nfor him, but he would certainly not devote himself to it. K. at one\ntime had provided the counter-balance to what the deputy director said\nbut the director was now coming more and more under his influence, and\nthe deputy director would also exploit the weakened condition of the\ndirector to strengthen his own power. So what could K. hope for? Maybe\nconsiderations of this sort weakened his power of resistance, but it\nwas still necessary not to deceive oneself and to see everything as\nclearly as it could be seen at that moment.\nFor no particular reason, just to avoiding returning to his desk for a\nwhile, he opened the window. It was difficult to open and he had to\nturn the handle with both his hands. Then, through the whole height and\nbreadth of the window, the mixture of fog and smoke was drawn into the\nroom, filling it with a slight smell of burning. A few flakes of snow\nwere blown in with it. \"It's a horrible autumn,\" said the manufacturer,\nwho had come into the room unnoticed after seeing the deputy director\nand now stood behind K. K. nodded and looked uneasily at the\nmanufacturer's briefcase, from which he would now probably take the\npapers and inform K. of the result of his negotiations with the deputy\ndirector. However, the manufacturer saw where K. was looking, knocked\non his briefcase and without opening it said, \"You'll be wanting to\nhear how things turned out. I've already got the contract in my pocket,\nalmost. He's a charming man, your deputy director--he's got his\ndangers, though.\" He laughed as he shook K.'s hand and wanted to make\nhim laugh with him. But to K., it once more seemed suspicious that the\nmanufacturer did not want to show him the papers and saw nothing about\nhis comments to laugh at. \"Chief clerk,\" said the manufacturer, \"I\nexpect the weather's been affecting your mood, has it? You're looking\nso worried today.\" \"Yes,\" said K., raising his hand and holding the\ntemple of his head, \"headaches, worries in the family.\" \"Quite right,\"\nsaid the manufacturer, who was always in a hurry and could never listen\nto anyone for very long, \"everyone has his cross to bear.\" K. had\nunconsciously made a step towards the door as if wanting to show the\nmanufacturer out, but the manufacturer said, \"Chief clerk, there's\nsomething else I'd like to mention to you. I'm very sorry if it's\nsomething that'll be a burden to you today of all days but I've been to\nsee you twice already, lately, and each time I forgot all about it. If I\ndelay it any longer it might well lose its point altogether. That would\nbe a pity, as I think what I've got to say does have some value.\" Before\nK. had had the time to answer, the manufacturer came up close to him,\ntapped his knuckle lightly on his chest and said quietly, \"You've got a\ntrial going on, haven't you?\" K. stepped back and immediately exclaimed,\n\"That's what the deputy director's been telling you!\" \"No, no,\" said\nthe manufacturer, \"how would the deputy director know about it?\" \"And\nwhat about you?\" asked K., already more in control of himself. \"I hear\nthings about the court here and there,\" said the manufacturer, \"and that\neven applies to what it is that I wanted to tell you about.\" \"There are\nso many people who have connections with the court!\" said K. with\nlowered head, and he led the manufacturer over to his desk. They sat\ndown where they had been before, and the manufacturer said, \"I'm afraid\nit's not very much that I've got to tell you about. Only, in matters\nlike this, it's best not to overlook the tiniest details. Besides, I\nreally want to help you in some way, however modest my help might be.\nWe've been good business partners up till now, haven't we? Well then.\"\nK. wanted to apologise for his behaviour in the conversation earlier\nthat day, but the manufacturer would tolerate no interruption, shoved\nhis briefcase up high in his armpit to show that he was in a hurry, and\ncarried on. \"I know about your case through a certain Titorelli. He's a\npainter, Titorelli's just his artistic name, I don't even know what his\nreal name is. He's been coming to me in my office for years from time to\ntime, and brings little pictures with him which I buy more or less just\nfor the sake of charity as he's hardly more than a beggar. And they're\nnice pictures, too, moorland landscapes and that sort of thing. We'd\nboth got used to doing business in this way and it always went smoothly.\nOnly, one time these visits became a bit too frequent, I began to tell\nhim off for it, we started talking and I became interested how it was\nthat he could earn a living just by painting, and then I learned to my\namazement that his main source of income was painting portraits. 'I work\nfor the court,' he said, 'what court?' said I. And that's when he told\nme about the court. I'm sure you can imagine how amazed I was at being\ntold all this. Ever since then I learn something new about the court\nevery time he comes to visit, and so little by little I get to\nunderstand something of how it works. Anyway, Titorelli talks a lot and\nI often have to push him away, not only because he's bound to be lying\nbut also, most of all, because a businessman like me who's already close\nto breaking point under the weight of his own business worries can't pay\ntoo much attention to other people's. But all that's just by the by.\nPerhaps--this is what I've been thinking--perhaps Titorelli might be\nable to help you in some small way, he knows lots of judges and even if\nhe can't have much influence himself he can give you some advice about\nhow to get some influential people on your side. And even if this\nadvice doesn't turn out to make all the difference I still think it'll\nbe very important once you've got it. You're nearly a lawyer yourself.\nThat's what I always say, Mr. K. the chief clerk is nearly a lawyer. Oh\nI'm sure this trial of yours will turn out all right. So do you want to\ngo and see Titorelli, then. If I ask him to he'll certainly do\neverything he possibly can. I really do think you ought to go. It\nneedn't be today, of course, just some time, when you get the chance.\nAnd anyway--I want to tell you this too--you don't actually have to go\nand see Titorelli, this advice from me doesn't place you under any\nobligation at all. No, if you think you can get by without Titorelli\nit'll certainly be better to leave him completely out of it. Maybe\nyou've already got a clear idea of what you're doing and Titorelli could\nupset your plans. No, if that's the case then of course you shouldn't go\nthere under any circumstances! And it certainly won't be easy to take\nadvice from a lad like that. Still, it's up to you. Here's the letter of\nrecommendation and here's the address.\"\nDisappointed, K. took the letter and put it in his pocket. Even at\nbest, the advantage he might derive from this recommendation was\nincomparably smaller than the damage that lay in the fact of the\nmanufacturer knowing about his trial, and that the painter was spreading\nthe news about. It was all he could manage to give the manufacturer, who\nwas already on his way to the door, a few words of thanks. \"I'll go\nthere,\" he said as he took his leave of the manufacturer at the door,\n\"or, as I'm very busy at present, I'll write to him, perhaps he would\nlike to come to me in my office some time.\" \"I was sure you'd find the\nbest solution,\" said the manufacturer. \"Although I had thought you'd\nprefer to avoid inviting people like this Titorelli to the bank and\ntalking about the trial here. And it's not always a good idea to send\nletters to people like Titorelli, you don't know what might happen to\nthem. But you're bound to have thought everything through and you know\nwhat you can and can't do.\" K. nodded and accompanied the manufacturer\non through the ante-room. But despite seeming calm on the outside he was\nactually very shocked; he had told the manufacturer he would write to\nTitorelli only to show him in some way that he valued his\nrecommendations and would consider the opportunity to speak with\nTitorelli without delay, but if he had thought Titorelli could offer any\nworthwhile assistance he would not have delayed. But it was only the\nmanufacturer's comment that made K. realise what dangers that could lead\nto. Was he really able to rely on his own understanding so little? If it\nwas possible that he might invite a questionable character into the bank\nwith a clear letter, and ask advice from him about his trial, separated\nfrom the deputy director by no more than a door, was it not possible or\neven very likely that there were also other dangers he had failed to see\nor that he was even running towards? There was not always someone\nbeside him to warn him. And just now, just when he would have to act\nwith all the strength he could muster, now a number of doubts of a sort\nhe had never before known had presented themselves and affected his own\nvigilance! The difficulties he had been feeling in carrying out his\noffice work; were they now going to affect the trial too? Now, at least,\nhe found himself quite unable to understand how he could have intended\nto write to Titorelli and invite him into the bank.\nHe shook his head at the thought of it once more as the servitor came\nup beside him and drew his attention to the three gentlemen who were\nwaiting on a bench in the ante-room. They had already been waiting to\nsee K. for a long time. Now that the servitor was speaking with K. they\nhad stood up and each of them wanted to make use of the opportunity to\nsee K. before the others. It had been negligent of the bank to let them\nwaste their time here in the waiting room, but none of them wanted to\ndraw attention to this. \"Mr. K., ...\" one of them was saying, but K.\nhad told the servitor to fetch his winter coat and said to the three of\nthem, as the servitor helped him to put it on, \"Please forgive me,\ngentlemen, I'm afraid I have no time to see you at present. Please do\nforgive me but I have some urgent business to settle and have to leave\nstraight away. You've already seen yourselves how long I've been\ndelayed. Would you be so kind as to come back tomorrow or some time? Or\nperhaps we could settle your affairs by telephone. Or perhaps you would\nlike to tell me now, briefly, what it's about and I can then give you a\nfull answer in writing. Whatever, the best thing will be for you to\ncome here again.\" The gentlemen now saw that their wait had been\ntotally pointless, and these suggestions of K.'s left them so astounded\nthat they looked at each other without a word. \"That's agreed then, is\nit?\" asked K., who had turned toward the servitor bringing him his hat.\nThrough the open door of K.'s office they could see that the snowfall\noutside had become much heavier. So K. turned the collar of his coat up\nand buttoned it up high under his chin. Just then the deputy director\ncame out of the adjoining room, smiled as he saw K. negotiating with\nthe gentlemen in his winter coat, and asked, \"Are you about to go out?\"\n\"Yes,\" said K., standing more upright, \"I have to go out on some\nbusiness.\" But the deputy director had already turned towards the\ngentlemen. \"And what about these gentlemen?\" he asked. \"I think they've\nalready been waiting quite a long time.\" \"We've already come to an\nunderstanding,\" said K. But now the gentlemen could be held back no\nlonger, they surrounded K. and explained that they would not have been\nwaiting for hours if it had not been about something important that had\nto be discussed now, at length and in private. The deputy director\nlistened to them for a short while, he also looked at K. as he held his\nhat in his hand cleaning the dust off it here and there, and then he\nsaid, \"Gentlemen, there is a very simple way to solve this. If you\nwould prefer it, I'll be very glad to take over these negotiations\ninstead of the chief clerk. Your business does, of course, need to be\ndiscussed without delay. We are businessmen like yourselves and know the\nvalue of a businessman's time. Would you like to come this way?\" And he\nopened the door leading to the ante-room of his own office.\nThe deputy director seemed very good at appropriating everything that\nK. was now forced to give up! But was K. not giving up more than he\nabsolutely had to? By running off to some unknown painter, with, as he\nhad to admit, very little hope of any vague benefit, his renown was\nsuffering damage that could not be repaired. It would probably be much\nbetter to take off his winter coat again and, at the very least, try to\nwin back the two gentlemen who were certainly still waiting in the next\nroom. If K. had not then glimpsed the deputy director in his office,\nlooking for something from his bookshelves as if they were his own, he\nwould probably even have made the attempt. As K., somewhat agitated,\napproached the door the deputy director called out, \"Oh, you've still\nnot left!\" He turned his face toward him--its many deep folds seemed to\nshow strength rather than age--and immediately began once more to\nsearch. \"I'm looking for a copy of a contract,\" he said, \"which this\ngentleman insists you must have. Could you help me look for it, do you\nthink?\" K. made a step forward, but the deputy director said, \"thank\nyou, I've already found it,\" and with a big package of papers, which\ncertainly must have included many more documents than just the copy of\nthe contract, he turned and went back into his own office.\n\"I can't deal with him right now,\" K. said to himself, \"but once my\npersonal difficulties have been settled, then he'll certainly be the\nfirst to get the effect of it, and he certainly won't like it.\"\nSlightly calmed by these thoughts, K. gave the servitor, who had already\nlong been holding the door to the corridor open for him, the task of\ntelling the director, when he was able, that K. was going out of the\nbank on a business matter. As he left the bank he felt almost happy at\nthe thought of being able to devote more of himself to his own business\nfor a while.",

            "text": "He went straight to the painter, who lived in an outlying part of town\nwhich was very near to the court offices, although this area was even\npoorer, the houses were darker, the streets were full of dirt that\nslowly blew about over the half-melted snow. In the great gateway to\nthe building where the painter lived only one of the two doors was open,\na hole had been broken open in the wall by the other door, and as K.\napproached it a repulsive, yellow, steaming liquid shot out causing\nsome rats to scurry away into the nearby canal. Down by the staircase\nthere was a small child lying on its belly crying, but it could hardly\nbe heard because of the noise from a metal-workshop on the other side\nof the entrance hall, drowning out any other sound. The door to the\nworkshop was open, three workers stood in a circle around some piece of\nwork that they were beating with hammers. A large tin plate hung on the\nwall, casting a pale light that pushed its way in between two of the\nworkers, lighting up their faces and their work-aprons. K. did no more\nthan glance at any of these things, he wanted to get things over with\nhere as soon as possible, to exchange just a few words to find out how\nthings stood with the painter and go straight back to the bank. Even if\nhe had just some tiny success here it would still have a good effect on\nhis work at the bank for that day. On the third floor he had to slow\ndown his pace, he was quite out of breath--the steps, just like the\nheight of each floor, were much higher than they needed to be and he'd\nbeen told that the painter lived right up in the attic. The air was\nalso quite oppressive, there was no proper stairwell and the narrow\nsteps were closed in by walls on both sides with no more than a small,\nhigh window here and there. Just as K. paused for a while some young\ngirls ran out of one of the flats and rushed higher up the stairs,\nlaughing. K. followed them slowly, caught up with one of the girls who\nhad stumbled and been left behind by the others, and asked her as they\nwent up side by side, \"Is there a painter, Titorelli, who lives here?\"\nThe girl, hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked, jabbed\nhim with her elbow and looked at him sideways. Her youth and her bodily\ndefects had done nothing to stop her being already quite depraved. She\ndid not smile once, but looked at K. earnestly, with sharp, acquisitive\neyes. K. pretended not to notice her behaviour and asked, \"Do you know\nTitorelli, the painter?\" She nodded and asked in reply, \"What d'you\nwant to see him for?\" K. thought it would be to his advantage quickly to\nfind out something more about Titorelli. \"I want to have him paint my\nportrait,\" he said. \"Paint your portrait?\" she asked, opening her mouth\ntoo wide and lightly hitting K. with her hand as if he had said\nsomething extraordinarily surprising or clumsy, with both hands she\nlifted her skirt, which was already very short, and, as fast as she\ncould, she ran off after the other girls whose indistinct shouts lost\nthemselves in the heights. At the next turn of the stairs, however, K.\nencountered all the girls once more. The hunchbacked girl had clearly\ntold them about K.'s intentions and they were waiting for him. They\nstood on both sides of the stairs, pressing themselves against the wall\nso that K. could get through between them, and smoothed their aprons\ndown with their hands. All their faces, even in this guard of honour,\nshowed a mixture of childishness and depravity. Up at the head of the\nline of girls, who now, laughing, began to close in around K., was the\nhunchback who had taken on the role of leader. It was thanks to her\nthat K. found the right direction without delay--he would have continued\nup the stairs straight in front of him, but she showed him that to\nreach Titorelli he would need to turn off to one side. The steps that\nled up to the painter were especially narrow, very long without any\nturning, the whole length could be seen in one glance and, at the top,\nat Titorelli's closed door, it came to its end. This door was much\nbetter illuminated than the rest of the stairway by the light from a\nsmall skylight set obliquely above it, it had been put together from\nunpainted planks of wood and the name 'Titorelli' was painted on it in\nbroad, red brushstrokes. K. was no more than half way up the steps,\naccompanied by his retinue of girls, when, clearly the result of the\nnoise of all those footsteps, the door opened slightly and in the crack\na man who seemed to be dressed in just his nightshirt appeared. \"Oh!\" he\ncried, when he saw the approaching crowd, and vanished. The hunchbacked\ngirl clapped her hands in glee and the other girls crowded in behind K.\nto push him faster forward.\nThey still had not arrived at the top, however, when the painter up\nabove them suddenly pulled the door wide open and, with a deep bow,\ninvited K. to enter. The girls, on the other hand, he tried to keep\naway, he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged\nhim and however much they tried to get in--if they could not get in with\nhis permission they would try to force their way in against his will.\nThe only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under\nhis outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her by\nthe skirt, span her once round and set her down again by the door with\nthe other girls who, unlike the first, had not dared to cross the\ndoorstep while the painter had left his post. K. did not know what he\nwas to make of all this, as they all seemed to be having fun. One behind\nthe other, the girls by the door stretched their necks up high and\ncalled out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but\nwhich K. did not understand, and even the painter laughed as the\nhunchback whirled round in his hand. Then he shut the door, bowed once\nmore to K., offered him his hand and introduced himself, saying,\n\"Titorelli, painter.\" K. pointed to the door, behind which the girls\nwere whispering, and said, \"You seem to be very popular in this\nbuilding.\" \"Ach, those brats!\" said the painter, trying in vain to\nfasten his nightshirt at the neck. He was also bare-footed and, apart\nfrom that, was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of yellowish linen\ntrousers held up with a belt whose free end whipped to and fro. \"Those\nkids are a real burden for me,\" he continued. The top button of his\nnightshirt came off and he gave up trying to fasten it, fetched a chair\nfor K. and made him sit down on it. \"I painted one of them once--she's\nnot here today--and ever since then they've been following me about. If\nI'm here they only come in when I allow it, but as soon as I've gone out\nthere's always at least one of them in here. They had a key made to my\ndoor and lend it round to each other. It's hard to imagine what a pain\nthat is. Suppose I come back home with a lady I'm going to paint, I open\nthe door with my own key and find the hunchback there or something, by\nthe table painting her lips red with my paintbrush, and meanwhile her\nlittle sisters will be keeping guard for her, moving about and causing\nchaos in every corner of the room. Or else, like happened yesterday, I\nmight come back home late in the evening--please forgive my appearance\nand the room being in a mess, it is to do with them--so, I might come\nhome late in the evening and want to go to bed, then I feel something\npinching my leg, look under the bed and pull another of them out from\nunder it. I don't know why it is they bother me like this, I expect\nyou've just seen that I do nothing to encourage them to come near me.\nAnd they make it hard for me to do my work too, of course. If I didn't\nget this studio for nothing I'd have moved out a long time ago.\" Just\nthen, a little voice, tender and anxious, called out from under the\ndoor, \"Titorelli, can we come in now?\" \"No,\" answered the painter. \"Not\neven just me, by myself?\" the voice asked again. \"Not even just you,\"\nsaid the painter, as he went to the door and locked it.\nMeanwhile, K. had been looking round the room, if it had not been\npointed out it would never have occurred to him that this wretched\nlittle room could be called a studio. It was hardly long enough or\nbroad enough to make two steps. Everything, floor, walls and ceiling,\nwas made of wood, between the planks narrow gaps could be seen. Across\nfrom where K. was, the bed stood against the wall under a covering of\nmany different colours. In the middle of the room a picture stood on an\neasel, covered over with a shirt whose arms dangled down to the ground.\nBehind K. was the window through which the fog made it impossible to\nsee further than the snow covered roof of the neighbouring building.\nThe turning of the key in the lock reminded K. that he had not wanted\nto stay too long. So he drew the manufacturer's letter out from his\npocket, held it out to the painter and said, \"I learned about you from\nthis gentleman, an acquaintance of yours, and it's on his advice that\nI've come here.\" The painter glanced through the letter and threw it\ndown onto the bed. If the manufacturer had not said very clearly that\nTitorelli was an acquaintance of his, a poor man who was dependent on\nhis charity, then it would really have been quite possible to believe\nthat Titorelli did not know him or at least that he could not remember\nhim. This impression was augmented by the painter's asking, \"Were you\nwanting to buy some pictures or did you want to have yourself painted?\"\nK. looked at the painter in astonishment. What did the letter actually\nsay? K. had taken it as a matter of course that the manufacturer had\nexplained to the painter in his letter that K. wanted nothing more with\nhim than to find out more about his trial. He had been far too rash in\ncoming here! But now he had to give the painter some sort of answer\nand, glancing at the easel, said, \"Are you working on a picture\ncurrently?\" \"Yes,\" said the painter, and he took the shirt hanging over\nthe easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter. \"It's a portrait.\nQuite a good piece of work, although it's not quite finished yet.\" This\nwas a convenient coincidence for K., it gave him a good opportunity to\ntalk about the court as the picture showed, very clearly, a judge.\nWhat's more, it was remarkably similar to the picture in the lawyer's\noffice, although this one showed a quite different judge, a heavy man\nwith a full beard which was black and bushy and extended to the sides\nfar up the man's cheeks. The lawyer's picture was also an oil painting,\nwhereas this one had been made with pastel colours and was pale and\nunclear. But everything else about the picture was similar, as this\njudge, too, was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemed\nominously about to rise from it. At first K. was about to say, \"He\ncertainly is a judge,\" but he held himself back for the time being and\nwent closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail. There\nwas a large figure shown in the middle of the throne's back rest which\nK. could not understand and asked the painter about it. That'll need\nsome more work done on it, the painter told him, and taking a pastel\ncrayon from a small table he added a few strokes to the edges of the\nfigure but without making it any clearer as far as K. could make out.\n\"That's the figure of justice,\" said the painter, finally. \"Now I see,\"\nsaid K., \"here's the blindfold and here are the scales. But aren't those\nwings on her heels, and isn't she moving?\" \"Yes,\" said the painter, \"I\nhad to paint it like that according to the contract. It's actually the\nfigure of justice and the goddess of victory all in one.\" \"That is not a\ngood combination,\" said K. with a smile. \"Justice needs to remain\nstill, otherwise the scales will move about and it won't be possible to\nmake a just verdict.\" \"I'm just doing what the client wanted,\" said the\npainter. \"Yes, certainly,\" said K., who had not meant to criticise\nanyone by that comment. \"You've painted the figure as it actually\nappears on the throne.\" \"No,\" said the painter, \"I've never seen that\nfigure or that throne, it's all just invention, but they told me what\nit was I had to paint.\" \"How's that?\" asked K. pretending not fully to\nunderstand what the painter said. \"That is a judge sitting on the\njudge's chair, isn't it?\" \"Yes,\" said the painter, \"but that judge\nisn't very high up and he's never sat on any throne like that.\" \"And he\nhas himself painted in such a grand pose. He's sitting there just like\nthe president of the court.\" \"Yeah, gentlemen like this are very vain,\"\nsaid the painter. \"But they have permission from higher up to get\nthemselves painted like this. It's laid down quite strictly just what\nsort of portrait each of them can get for himself. Only it's a pity that\nyou can't make out the details of his costume and pose in this picture,\npastel colours aren't really suitable for showing people like this.\"\n\"Yes,\" said K., \"it does seem odd that it's in pastel colours.\" \"That's\nwhat the judge wanted,\" said the painter, \"it's meant to be for a\nwoman.\" The sight of the picture seemed to make him feel like working,\nhe rolled up his shirtsleeves, picked up a few of the crayons, and K.\nwatched as a reddish shadow built up around the head of the judge under\ntheir quivering tips and radiated out the to edges of the picture. This\nshadow play slowly surrounded the head like a decoration or lofty\ndistinction. But around the figure of Justice, apart from some\ncoloration that was barely noticeable, it remained light, and in this\nbrightness the figure seemed to shine forward so that it now looked\nlike neither the God of Justice nor the God of Victory, it seemed now,\nrather, to be a perfect depiction of the God of the Hunt. K. found the\npainter's work more engrossing than he had wanted; but finally he\nreproached himself for staying so long without having done anything\nrelevant to his own affair. \"What's the name of this judge?\" he asked\nsuddenly. \"I'm not allowed to tell you that,\" the painter answered. He\nwas bent deeply over the picture and clearly neglecting his guest who,\nat first, he had received with such care. K. took this to be just a\nfoible of the painter's, and it irritated him as it made him lose time.\n\"I take it you must be a trustee of the court,\" he said. The painter\nimmediately put his crayons down, stood upright, rubbed his hands\ntogether and looked at K. with a smile. \"Always straight out with the\ntruth,\" he said. \"You want to learn something about the court, like it\nsays in your letter of recommendation, but then you start talking about\nmy pictures to get me on your side. Still, I won't hold it against you,\nyou weren't to know that that was entirely the wrong thing to try with\nme. Oh, please!\" he said sharply, repelling K.'s attempt to make some\nobjection. He then continued, \"And besides, you're quite right in your\ncomment that I'm a trustee of the court.\" He made a pause, as if\nwanting to give K. the time to come to terms with this fact. The girls\ncould once more be heard from behind the door. They were probably\npressed around the keyhole, perhaps they could even see into the room\nthrough the gaps in the planks. K. forewent the opportunity to excuse\nhimself in some way as he did not wish to distract the painter from what\nhe was saying, or else perhaps he didn't want him to get too far above\nhimself and in this way make himself to some extent unattainable, so he\nasked, \"Is that a publicly acknowledged position?\" \"No,\" was the\npainter's curt reply, as if the question prevented him saying any more.\nBut K. wanted him to continue speaking and said, \"Well, positions like\nthat, that aren't officially acknowledged, can often have more influence\nthan those that are.\" \"And that's how it is with me,\" said the painter,\nand nodded with a frown. \"I was talking about your case with the\nmanufacturer yesterday, and he asked me if I wouldn't like to help you,\nand I answered: 'He can come and see me if he likes,' and now I'm\npleased to see you here so soon. This business seems to be quite\nimportant to you, and, of course, I'm not surprised at that. Would you\nnot like to take your coat off now?\" K. had intended to stay for only a\nvery short time, but the painter's invitation was nonetheless very\nwelcome. The air in the room had slowly become quite oppressive for him,\nhe had several times looked in amazement at a small, iron stove in the\ncorner that certainly could not have been lit, the heat of the room was\ninexplicable. As he took off his winter overcoat and also unbuttoned\nhis frock coat the painter said to him in apology, \"I must have warmth.\nAnd it is very cosy here, isn't it. This room's very good in that\nrespect.\" K. made no reply, but it was actually not the heat that made\nhim uncomfortable but, much more, the stuffiness, the air that almost\nmade it more difficult to breathe, the room had probably not been\nventilated for a long time. The unpleasantness of this was made all the\nstronger for K. when the painter invited him to sit on the bed while he\nhimself sat down on the only chair in the room in front of the easel.\nThe painter even seemed to misunderstand why K. remained at the edge of\nthe bed and urged K. to make himself comfortable, and as he hesitated\nhe went over to the bed himself and pressed K. deep down into the\nbedclothes and pillows. Then he went back to his seat and at last he\nasked his first objective question, which made K. forget everything\nelse. \"You're innocent, are you?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said K. He felt a\nsimple joy at answering this question, especially as the answer was\ngiven to a private individual and therefore would have no consequences.\nUp till then no-one had asked him this question so openly. To make the\nmost of his pleasure he added, \"I am totally innocent.\" \"So,\" said the\npainter, and he lowered his head and seemed to be thinking. Suddenly he\nraised his head again and said, \"Well if you're innocent it's all very\nsimple.\" K. began to scowl, this supposed trustee of the court was\ntalking like an ignorant child. \"My being innocent does not make things\nsimple,\" said K. Despite everything, he couldn't help smiling and\nslowly shook his head. \"There are many fine details in which the court\ngets lost, but in the end it reaches into some place where originally\nthere was nothing and pulls enormous guilt out of it.\" \"Yeah, yeah,\nsure,\" said the painter, as if K. had been disturbing his train of\nthought for no reason. \"But you are innocent, aren't you?\" \"Well of\ncourse I am,\" said K. \"That's the main thing,\" said the painter. There\nwas no counter-argument that could influence him, but although he had\nmade up his mind it was not clear whether he was talking this way\nbecause of conviction or indifference. K., then, wanted to find out and\nsaid therefore, \"I'm sure you're more familiar with the court than I am,\nI know hardly more about it than what I've heard, and that's been from\nmany very different people. But they were all agreed on one thing, and\nthat was that when ill thought-out accusations are made they are not\nignored, and that once the court has made an accusation it is convinced\nof the guilt of the defendant and it's very hard to make it think\notherwise.\" \"Very hard?\" the painter asked, throwing one hand up in the\nair. \"It's impossible to make it think otherwise. If I painted all the\njudges next to each other here on canvas, and you were trying to defend\nyourself in front of it, you'd have more success with them than you'd\never have with the real court.\" \"Yes,\" said K. to himself, forgetting\nthat he had only gone there to investigate the painter.\nOne of the girls behind the door started up again, and asked,\n\"Titorelli, is he going to go soon?\" \"Quiet!\" shouted the painter at\nthe door, \"Can't you see I'm talking with the gentleman?\" But this was\nnot enough to satisfy the girl and she asked, \"You going to paint his\npicture?\" And when the painter didn't answer she added, \"Please don't\npaint him, he's an 'orrible bloke.\" There followed an incomprehensible,\ninterwoven babble of shouts and replies and calls of agreement. The\npainter leapt over to the door, opened it very slightly--the girls'\nclasped hands could be seen stretching through the crack as if they\nwanted something--and said, \"If you're not quiet I'll throw you all\ndown the stairs. Sit down here on the steps and be quiet.\" They probably\ndid not obey him immediately, so that he had to command, \"Down on the\nsteps!\" Only then it became quiet.\n\"I'm sorry about that,\" said the painter as he returned to K. K. had\nhardly turned towards the door, he had left it completely up to the\npainter whether and how he would place him under his protection if he\nwanted to. Even now, he made hardly any movement as the painter bent\nover him and, whispering into his ear in order not to be heard outside,\nsaid, \"These girls belong to the court as well.\" \"How's that?\" asked\nK., as he leant his head to one side and looked at the painter. But the\npainter sat back down on his chair and, half in jest, half in\nexplanation, \"Well, everything belongs to the court.\" \"That is\nsomething I had never noticed until now,\" said K. curtly, this general\ncomment of the painter's made his comment about the girls far less\ndisturbing. Nonetheless, K. looked for a while at the door, behind which\nthe girls were now sitting quietly on the steps. Except, that one of\nthem had pushed a drinking straw through a crack between the planks and\nwas moving it slowly up and down. \"You still don't seem to have much\ngeneral idea of what the court's about,\" said the painter, who had\nstretched his legs wide apart and was tapping loudly on the floor with\nthe tip of his foot. \"But as you're innocent you won't need it anyway.\nI'll get you out of this by myself.\" \"How do you intend to do that?\"\nasked K. \"You did say yourself not long ago that it's quite impossible\nto go to the court with reasons and proofs.\" \"Only impossible for\nreasons and proofs you take to the court yourself,\" said the painter,\nraising his forefinger as if K. had failed to notice a fine distinction.\n\"It goes differently if you try to do something behind the public court,\nthat's to say in the consultation rooms, in the corridors or here, for\ninstance, in my studio.\" K. now began to find it far easier to believe\nwhat the painter was saying, or rather it was largely in agreement with\nwhat he had also been told by others. In fact it was even quite\npromising. If it really was so easy to influence the judges through\npersonal contacts as the lawyer had said then the painter's contacts\nwith these vain judges was especially important, and at the very least\nshould not be undervalued. And the painter would fit in very well in the\ncircle of assistants that K. was slowly gathering around himself. He had\nbeen noted at the bank for his talent in organising, here, where he was\nplaced entirely on his own resources, would be a good opportunity to\ntest that talent to its limits. The painter observed the effect his\nexplanation had had on K. and then, with a certain unease, said, \"Does\nit not occur to you that the way I'm speaking is almost like a lawyer?\nIt's the incessant contact with the gentlemen of the court has that\ninfluence on me. I gain a lot by it, of course, but I lose a lot,\nartistically speaking.\" \"How did you first come into contact with the\njudges, then?\" asked K., he wanted first to gain the painter's trust\nbefore he took him into his service. \"That was very easy,\" said the\npainter, \"I inherited these contacts. My father was court painter before\nme. It's a position that's always inherited. They can't use new people\nfor it, the rules governing how the various grades of officials are\npainted are so many and varied, and, above all, so secret that no-one\noutside of certain families even knows them. In the drawer there, for\ninstance, I've got my father's notes, which I don't show to anyone. But\nyou're only able to paint judges if you know what they say. Although,\neven if I lost them no-one could ever dispute my position because of all\nthe rules I just carry round in my head. All the judges want to be\npainted like the old, great judges were, and I'm the only one who can do\nthat.\" \"You are to be envied,\" said K., thinking of his position at the\nbank. \"Your position is quite unassailable, then?\" \"Yes, quite\nunassailable,\" said the painter, and he raised his shoulders in pride.\n\"That's how I can even afford to help some poor man facing trial now and\nthen.\" \"And how do you do that?\" asked K., as if the painter had not\njust described him as a poor man. The painter did not let himself be\ndistracted, but said, \"In your case, for instance, as you're totally\ninnocent, this is what I'll do.\" The repeated mention of K.'s innocence\nwas becoming irksome to him. It sometimes seemed to him as if the\npainter was using these comments to make a favourable outcome to the\ntrial a precondition for his help, which of course would make the help\nitself unnecessary. But despite these doubts K. forced himself not to\ninterrupt the painter. He did not want to do without the painter's help,\nthat was what he had decided, and this help did not seem in any way less\nquestionable than that of the lawyer. K. valued the painter's help far\nmore highly because it was offered in a way that was more harmless and\nopen.\nThe painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and continued in a\nsubdued voice: \"I forgot to ask you: what sort of acquittal is it you\nwant. There are three possibilities: absolute acquittal, apparent\nacquittal and deferment. Absolute acquittal is the best, of course,\nonly there's nothing I could do to get that sort of outcome. I don't\nthink there's anyone at all who could do anything to get an absolute\nacquittal. Probably the only thing that could do that is if the accused\nis innocent. As you are innocent it could actually be possible and you\ncould depend on your innocence alone. In that case you won't need me or\nany other kind of help.\"\nAt first, K. was astonished at this orderly explanation, but then, just\nas quietly as the painter, he said, \"I think you're contradicting\nyourself.\" \"How's that?\" asked the painter patiently, leaning back with\na smile. This smile made K. feel as if he were examining not the words\nof the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedures of the\ncourt itself. Nonetheless, he continued unabashed and said, \"You\nremarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasoned\nproofs, you later restricted this to the open court, and now you go so\nfar as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court. That\nentails a contradiction. Moreover, you said earlier that the judges can\nbe influenced personally but now you insist that an absolute acquittal,\nas you call it, can never be attained through personal influence. That\nentails a second contradiction.\" \"It's quite easy to clear up these\ncontradictions,\" said the painter. \"We're talking about two different\nthings here, there's what it says in the law and there's what I know\nfrom my own experience, you shouldn't get the two confused. I've never\nseen it in writing, but the law does, of course, say on the one hand\nthat the innocent will be set free, but on the other hand it doesn't\nsay that the judges can be influenced. But in my experience it's the\nother way round. I don't know of any absolute acquittals but I do know\nof many times when a judge has been influenced. It's possible, of\ncourse, that there was no innocence in any of the cases I know about.\nBut is that likely? Not a single innocent defendant in so many cases?\nWhen I was a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us\nabout court cases at home, and the judges that came to his studio talked\nabout the court, in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I\nhardly ever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of\nit when I could, I've listened to countless trials at important stages\nin their development, I've followed them closely as far as they could\nbe followed, and I have to say that I've never seen a single\nacquittal.\" \"So. Not a single acquittal,\" said K., as if talking to\nhimself and his hopes. \"That confirms the impression I already have of\nthe court. So there's no point in it from this side either. They could\nreplace the whole court with a single hangman.\" \"You shouldn't\ngeneralise,\" said the painter, dissatisfied, \"I've only been talking\nabout my own experience.\" \"Well that's enough,\" said K., \"or have you\nheard of any acquittals that happened earlier?\" \"They say there have\nbeen some acquittals earlier,\" the painter answered, \"but it's very hard\nto be sure about it. The courts don't make their final conclusions\npublic, not even the judges are allowed to know about them, so that all\nwe know about these earlier cases are just legends. But most of them did\ninvolve absolute acquittals, you can believe that, but they can't be\nproved. On the other hand, you shouldn't forget all about them either,\nI'm sure there is some truth to them, and they are very beautiful, I've\npainted a few pictures myself depicting these legends.\" \"My assessment\nwill not be altered by mere legends,\" said K. \"I don't suppose it's\npossible to cite these legends in court, is it?\" The painter laughed.\n\"No, you can't cite them in court,\" he said. \"Then there's no point in\ntalking about them,\" said K., he wanted, for the time being, to accept\nanything the painter told him, even if he thought it unlikely or\ncontradicted what he had been told by others. He did not now have the\ntime to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even to\ndisprove it, he would have achieved as much as he could if the painter\nwould help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive. As a\nresult, he said, \"So let's pay no more attention to absolute acquittal,\nbut you mentioned two other possibilities.\" \"Apparent acquittal and\ndeferment. They're the only possibilities,\" said the painter. \"But\nbefore we talk about them, would you not like to take your coat off? You\nmust be hot.\" \"Yes,\" said K., who until then had paid attention to\nnothing but the painter's explanations, but now that he had had the heat\npointed out to him his brow began to sweat heavily. \"It's almost\nunbearable.\" The painter nodded as if he understood K.'s discomfort very\nwell. \"Could we not open the window?\" asked K. \"No,\" said the painter.\n\"It's only a fixed pane of glass, it can't be opened.\" K. now realised\nthat all this time he had been hoping the painter would suddenly go over\nto the window and pull it open. He had prepared himself even for the fog\nthat he would breathe in through his open mouth. The thought that here\nhe was entirely cut off from the air made him feel dizzy. He tapped\nlightly on the bedspread beside him and, with a weak voice, said, \"That\nis very inconvenient and unhealthy.\" \"Oh no,\" said the painter in\ndefence of his window, \"as it can't be opened this room retains the heat\nbetter than if the window were double glazed, even though it's only a\nsingle pane. There's not much need to air the room as there's so much\nventilation through the gaps in the wood, but when I do want to I can\nopen one of my doors, or even both of them.\" K. was slightly consoled\nby this explanation and looked around to see where the second door was.\nThe painter saw him do so and said, \"It's behind you, I had to hide it\nbehind the bed.\" Only then was K. able to see the little door in the\nwall. \"It's really much too small for a studio here,\" said the painter,\nas if he wanted to anticipate an objection K. would make. \"I had to\narrange things as well as I could. That's obviously a very bad place for\nthe bed, in front of the door. For instance when the judge I'm painting\nat present comes he always comes through the door by the bed, and I've\neven given him a key to this door so that he can wait for me here in the\nstudio when I'm not home. Although nowadays he usually comes early in\nthe morning when I'm still asleep. And of course, it always wakes me up\nwhen I hear the door opened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am. If\nyou could hear the way I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the\nmorning you'd lose all respect for judges. I suppose I could take the\nkey away from him but that'd only make things worse. It only takes a\ntiny effort to break any of the doors here off their hinges.\" All the\ntime the painter was speaking, K. was considering whether he should take\noff his coat, but he finally realised that, if he didn't do so, he would\nbe quite unable to stay here any longer, so he took off his frock coat\nand lay it on his knee so that he could put it back on again as soon as\nthe conversation was over. He had hardly done this when one of the girls\ncalled out, \"Now he's taken his coat off!\" and they could all be heard\npressing around the gaps in the planks to see the spectacle for\nthemselves. \"The girls think I'm going to paint your portrait,\" said the\npainter, \"and that's why you're taking your coat off.\" \"I see,\" said K.,\nonly slightly amused by this, as he felt little better than he had\nbefore even though he now sat in his shirtsleeves. With some irritation\nhe asked, \"What did you say the two other possibilities were?\" He had\nalready forgotten the terms used. \"Apparent acquittal and deferment,\"\nsaid the painter. \"It's up to you which one you choose. You can get\neither of them if I help you, but it'll take some effort of course, the\ndifference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentrated\neffort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it has\nto be sustained. Now then, apparent acquittal. If that's what you want\nI'll write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of paper. The\ntext for an assertion of this sort was passed down to me from my father\nand it's quite unassailable. I take this assertion round to the judges I\nknow. So I'll start off with the one I'm currently painting, and put\nthe assertion to him when he comes for his sitting this evening. I'll\nlay the assertion in front of him, explain that you're innocent and give\nhim my personal guarantee of it. And that's not just a superficial\nguarantee, it's a real one and it's binding.\" The painter's eyes seemed\nto show some reproach of K. for wanting to impose that sort of\nresponsibility on him. \"That would be very kind of you,\" said K. \"And\nwould the judge then believe you and nonetheless not pass an absolute\nacquittal?\" \"It's like I just said,\" answered the painter. \"And anyway,\nit's not entirely sure that all the judges would believe me, many of\nthem, for instance, might want me to bring you to see them personally.\nSo then you'd have to come along too. But at least then, if that\nhappens, the matter is half way won, especially as I'd teach you in\nadvance exactly how you'd need to act with the judge concerned, of\ncourse. What also happens, though, is that there are some judges who'll\nturn me down in advance, and that's worse. I'll certainly make several\nattempts, but still, we'll have to forget about them, but at least we\ncan afford to do that as no one judge can pass the decisive verdict.\nThen when I've got enough judges' signatures on this document I take it\nto the judge who's concerned with your case. I might even have his\nsignature already, in which case things develop a bit quicker than they\nwould do otherwise. But there aren't usually many hold ups from then\non, and that's the time that the defendant can feel most confident.\nIt's odd, but true, that people feel more confidence in this time than\nthey do after they've been acquitted. There's no particular exertion\nneeded now. When he has the document asserting the defendant's\ninnocence, guaranteed by a number of other judges, the judge can acquit\nyou without any worries, and although there are still several\nformalities to be gone through there's no doubt that that's what he'll\ndo as a favour to me and several other acquaintances. You, however, walk\nout the court and you're free.\" \"So, then I'll be free,\" said K.,\nhesitantly. \"That's right,\" said the painter, \"but only apparently free\nor, to put it a better way, temporarily free, as the most junior judges,\nthe ones I know, they don't have the right to give the final acquittal.\nOnly the highest judge can do that, in the court that's quite out of\nreach for you, for me and for all of us. We don't know how things look\nthere and, incidentally, we don't want to know. The right to acquit\npeople is a major privilege and our judges don't have it, but they do\nhave the right to free people from the indictment. That's to say, if\nthey're freed in this way then for the time being the charge is\nwithdrawn but it's still hanging over their heads and it only takes an\norder from higher up to bring it back into force. And as I'm in such\ngood contact with the court I can also tell you how the difference\nbetween absolute and apparent acquittal is described, just in a\nsuperficial way, in the directives to the court offices. If there's an\nabsolute acquittal all proceedings should stop, everything disappears\nfrom the process, not just the indictment but the trial and even the\nacquittal disappears, everything just disappears. With an apparent\nacquittal it's different. When that happens, nothing has changed except\nthat the case for your innocence, for your acquittal and the grounds for\nthe acquittal have been made stronger. Apart from that, proceedings go\non as before, the court offices continue their business and the case\ngets passed to higher courts, gets passed back down to the lower courts\nand so on, backwards and forwards, sometimes faster, sometimes slower,\nto and fro. It's impossible to know exactly what's happening while this\nis going on. Seen from outside it can sometimes seem that everything has\nbeen long since forgotten, the documents have been lost and the\nacquittal is complete. No-one familiar with the court would believe it.\nNo documents ever get lost, the court forgets nothing. One day--no-one\nexpects it--some judge or other picks up the documents and looks more\nclosely at them, he notices that this particular case is still active,\nand orders the defendant's immediate arrest. I've been talking here as\nif there's a long delay between apparent acquittal and re-arrest, that\nis quite possible and I do know of cases like that, but it's just as\nlikely that the defendant goes home after he's been acquitted and finds\nsomebody there waiting to re-arrest him. Then, of course, his life as a\nfree man is at an end.\" \"And does the trial start over again?\" asked K.,\nfinding it hard to believe. \"The trial will always start over again,\"\nsaid the painter, \"but there is, once again as before, the possibility\nof getting an apparent acquittal. Once again, the accused has to muster\nall his strength and mustn't give up.\" The painter said that last phrase\npossibly as a result of the impression that K., whose shoulders had\ndropped somewhat, gave on him. \"But to get a second acquittal,\" asked\nK., as if in anticipation of further revelations by the painter, \"is\nthat not harder to get than the first time?\" \"As far as that's\nconcerned,\" answered the painter, \"there's nothing you can say for\ncertain. You mean, do you, that the second arrest would have an adverse\ninfluence on the judge and the verdict he passes on the defendant.\nThat's not how it happens. When the acquittal is passed the judges are\nalready aware that re-arrest is likely. So when it happens it has hardly\nany effect. But there are countless other reasons why the judges' mood\nand their legal acumen in the case can be altered, and efforts to obtain\nthe second acquittal must therefore be suited to the new conditions, and\ngenerally just as vigorous as the first.\" \"But this second acquittal\nwill once again not be final,\" said K., shaking his head. \"Of course\nnot,\" said the painter, \"the second acquittal is followed by the third\narrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrest and so on. That's what\nis meant by the term apparent acquittal.\" K. was silent. \"You clearly\ndon't think an apparent acquittal offers much advantage,\" said the\npainter, \"perhaps deferment would suit you better. Would you like me to\nexplain what deferment is about?\" K. nodded. The painter had leant back\nand spread himself out in his chair, his nightshirt was wide open, he\nhad pushed his hand inside and was stroking his breast and his sides.\n\"Deferment,\" said the painter, looking vaguely in front of himself for a\nwhile as if trying to find a perfectly appropriate explanation,\n\"deferment consists of keeping proceedings permanently in their earliest\nstages. To do that, the accused and those helping him need to keep in\ncontinuous personal contact with the court, especially those helping\nhim. I repeat, this doesn't require so much effort as getting an\napparent acquittal, but it probably requires a lot more attention. You\nmust never let the trial out of your sight, you have to go and see the\nappropriate judge at regular intervals as well as when something in\nparticular comes up and, whatever you do, you have to try and remain\nfriendly with him; if you don't know the judge personally you have to\ninfluence him through the judges you do know, and you have to do it\nwithout giving up on the direct discussions. As long as you don't fail\nto do any of these things you can be reasonably sure the trial won't get\npast its first stages. The trial doesn't stop, but the defendant is\nalmost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he'd been acquitted.\nCompared with an apparent acquittal, deferment has the advantage that\nthe defendant's future is less uncertain, he's safe from the shock of\nbeing suddenly re-arrested and doesn't need to fear the exertions and\nstress involved in getting an apparent acquittal just when everything\nelse in his life would make it most difficult. Deferment does have\ncertain disadvantages of its own though, too, and they shouldn't be\nunder-estimated. I don't mean by this that the defendant is never free,\nhe's never free in the proper sense of the word with an apparent\nacquittal either. There's another disadvantage. Proceedings can't be\nprevented from moving forward unless there are some at least ostensible\nreasons given. So something needs to seem to be happening when looked at\nfrom the outside. This means that from time to time various injunctions\nhave to be obeyed, the accused has to be questioned, investigations have\nto take place and so on. The trial's been artificially constrained\ninside a tiny circle, and it has to be continuously spun round within\nit. And that, of course, brings with it certain unpleasantnesses for the\naccused, although you shouldn't imagine they're all that bad. All of\nthis is just for show, the interrogations, for instance, they're only\nvery short, if you ever don't have the time or don't feel like going to\nthem you can offer an excuse, with some judges you can even arrange the\ninjunctions together a long time in advance, in essence all it means is\nthat, as the accused, you have to report to the judge from time to\ntime.\" Even while the painter was speaking those last words K. had laid\nhis coat over his arm and had stood up. Immediately, from outside the\ndoor, there was a cry of \"He's standing up now!\" \"Are you leaving\nalready?\" asked the painter, who had also stood up. \"It must be the air\nthat's driving you out. I'm very sorry about that. There's still a lot I\nneed to tell you. I had to put everything very briefly but I hope at\nleast it was all clear.\" \"Oh yes,\" said K., whose head was aching from\nthe effort of listening. Despite this affirmation the painter summed it\nall up once more, as if he wanted to give K. something to console him on\nhis way home. \"Both have in common that they prevent the defendant being\nconvicted,\" he said. \"But they also prevent his being properly\nacquitted,\" said K. quietly, as if ashamed to acknowledge it. \"You've\ngot it, in essence,\" said the painter quickly. K. placed his hand on his\nwinter overcoat but could not bring himself to put it on. Most of all he\nwould have liked to pack everything together and run out to the fresh\nair. Not even the girls could induce him to put his coat on, even though\nthey were already loudly telling each other that he was doing so. The\npainter still had to interpret K.'s mood in some way, so he said, \"I\nexpect you've deliberately avoided deciding between my suggestions yet.\nThat's good. I would even have advised against making a decision\nstraight away. There's no more than a hair's breadth of difference\nbetween the advantages and disadvantages. Everything has to be carefully\nweighed up. But the most important thing is you shouldn't lose too much\ntime.\" \"I'll come back here again soon,\" said K., who had suddenly\ndecided to put his frock coat on, threw his overcoat over his shoulder\nand hurried over to the door behind which the girls now began to scream.\nK. thought he could even see the screaming girls through the door.\n\"Well, you'll have to keep your word,\" said the painter, who had not\nfollowed him, \"otherwise I'll come to the bank to ask about it myself.\"\n\"Will you open this door for me,\" said K. pulling at the handle which,\nas he noticed from the resistance, was being held tightly by the girls\non the other side. \"Do you want to be bothered by the girls?\" asked the\npainter. \"It's better if you use the other way out,\" he said, pointing\nto the door behind the bed. K. agreed to this and jumped back to the\nbed. But instead of opening that door the painter crawled under the bed\nand from underneath it asked K., \"Just a moment more, would you not like\nto see a picture I could sell to you?\" K. did not want to be impolite,\nthe painter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in\nthe future, and because of K.'s forgetfulness there had been no mention\nof any payment for the painter's help, so K. could not turn him down now\nand allowed him to show him the picture, even though he was quivering\nwith impatience to get out of the studio. From under the bed, the\npainter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings. They were so covered in\ndust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust\nswirled around in front of K.'s eyes, robbing him of breath for some\ntime. \"Moorland landscape,\" said the painter passing the picture to K.\nIt showed two sickly trees, well separated from each other in dark\ngrass. In the background there was a multi-coloured sunset. \"That's\nnice,\" said K. \"I'll buy it.\" K. expressed himself in this curt way\nwithout any thought, so he was glad when the painter did not take this\namiss and picked up a second painting from the floor. \"This is a\ncounterpart to the first picture,\" said the painter. Perhaps it had been\nintended as a counterpart, but there was not the slightest difference to\nbe seen between it and the first picture, there were the trees, there\nthe grass and there the sunset. But this was of little importance to K.\n\"They are beautiful landscapes,\" he said, \"I'll buy them both and hang\nthem in my office.\" \"You seem to like this subject,\" said the painter,\npicking up a third painting, \"good job I've still got another, similar\npicture here.\" The picture though, was not similar, rather it was\nexactly the same moorland landscape. The painter was fully exploiting\nthis opportunity to sell off his old pictures. \"I'll take this one too,\"\nsaid K. \"How much do the three paintings cost?\" \"We can talk about that\nnext time,\" said the painter. \"You're in a hurry now, and we'll still be\nin contact. And besides, I'm glad you like the paintings, I'll give you\nall the paintings I've got down here. They're all moorland landscapes,\nI've painted a lot of moorland landscapes. A lot of people don't like\nthat sort of picture because they're too gloomy, but there are others,\nand you're one of them, who love gloomy themes.\" But K. was not in the\nmood to hear about the professional experiences of this painter cum\nbeggar. \"Wrap them all up!\" he called out, interrupting the painter as\nhe was speaking, \"my servant will come to fetch them in the morning.\"\n\"There's no need for that,\" said the painter. \"I expect I can find a\nporter for you who can go with you now.\" And, at last, he leant over the\nbed and unlocked the door. \"Just step on the bed, don't worry about\nthat,\" said the painter, \"that's what everyone does who comes in here.\"\nEven without this invitation, K. had shown no compunction in already\nplacing his foot in the middle of the bed covers, then he looked out\nthrough the open door and drew his foot back again. \"What is that?\" he\nasked the painter. \"What are you so surprised at?\" he asked, surprised\nin his turn. \"Those are court offices. Didn't you know there are court\noffices here. There are court offices in almost every attic, why should\nthis building be any different? Even my studio is actually one of the\ncourt offices but the court put it at my disposal.\" It was not so much\nfinding court offices even here that shocked K., he was mainly shocked\nat himself, at his own na\u00efvety in court matters. It seemed to him that\none of the most basic rules governing how a defendant should behave was\nalways to be prepared, never allow surprises, never to look,\nunsuspecting, to the right when the judge stood beside him to his\nleft--and this was the very basic rule that he was continually\nviolating. A long corridor extended in front of him, air blew in from it\nwhich, compared with the air in the studio, was refreshing. There were\nbenches set along each side of the corridor just as in the waiting area\nfor the office he went to himself. There seemed to be precise rules\ngoverning how offices should be equipped. There did not seem to be many\npeople visiting the offices that day. There was a man there, half\nsitting, half laying, his face was buried in his arm on the bench and he\nseemed to be sleeping; another man was standing in the half-dark at the\nend of the corridor. K. now climbed over the bed, the painter followed\nhim with the pictures. They soon came across a servant of the court--K.\nwas now able to recognise all the servants of the court from the gold\nbuttons they wore on their civilian clothes below the normal\nbuttons--and the painter instructed him to go with K. carrying the\npictures. K. staggered more than he walked, his handkerchief pressed\nover his mouth. They had nearly reached the exit when the girls stormed\nin on them, so K. had not been able to avoid them. They had clearly seen\nthat the second door of the studio had been opened and had gone around\nto impose themselves on him from this side. \"I can't come with you any\nfurther!\" called out the painter with a laugh as the girls pressed in.\n\"Goodbye, and don't hesitate too long!\" K. did not even look round at\nhim. Once on the street he took the first cab he came across. He now had\nto get rid of the servant, whose gold button continually caught his eye\neven if it caught no-one else's. As a servant, the servant of the court\nwas going to sit on the coach-box. But K. chased him down from there. It\nwas already well into the afternoon when K. arrived in front of the\nbank. He would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared\nthere might be some occasion when he would have to let the painter see\nhe still had them. So he had the pictures taken to his office and locked\nthem in the lowest drawer of his desk so that he could at least keep\nthem safe from the deputy director's view for the next few days.",

He had set his legs slightly apart, his\nhands, in which he held his hat, were behind his back. Merely by being\nin possession of a thick overcoat he felt his advantage over this thin\nlittle man. \"Oh God,\" he said and, shocked, raised one hand in front of\nhis face as if in defence, \"no, no, what can you be thinking?\" \"You look\nhonest enough,\" said K. with a smile, \"but come along anyway.\" K.\nindicated with his hat which way the man was to go and let him go ahead\nof him. \"What is your name then?\" asked K. on the way. \"Block. I'm a\nbusinessman,\" said the small man, twisting himself round as he thus\nintroduced himself, although K. did not allow him to stop moving. \"Is\nthat your real name?\" asked K. \"Of course it is,\" was the man's reply,\n\"why do you doubt it?\" \"I thought you might have some reason to keep\nyour name secret,\" said K.

He's very unwell today, but if you\nwant I'll tell him you're here. But you can certainly spend the night\nwith me. It's so long since you were last here, even the lawyer has been\nasking about you. Don't neglect your case! And I've got some things to\ntell you that I've learned about. But now, before anything else, take\nyour coat off!\" She helped him off with his coat, took the hat off his\nhead, ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up, then she ran\nback and saw to the soup. \"Do you want me to tell him you're here\nstraight away or take him his soup first?\" \"Tell him I'm here first,\"\nsaid K. He was in a bad mood, he had originally intended a detailed\ndiscussion of his business with Leni, especially the question of his\ngiving the lawyer notice, but now he no longer wanted to because of the\npresence of the businessman. Now he considered his affair too important\nto let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps change some\nof his decisions, and so he called Leni back even though she was already\non her way to the lawyer. \"Bring him his soup first,\" he said, \"I want",

The sooner it\nwas carried out the more harm would be avoided. And moreover, perhaps\nthe businessman had something to say on the matter.\nK. turned round, the businessman hardly noticed it as he was about to\nstand up. \"Stay where you are,\" said K. and pulled up a chair beside\nhim. \"Have you been a client of the lawyer's for a long time?\" asked K.\n\"Yes,\" said the businessman, \"a very long time.\" \"How many years has he\nbeen representing you so far, then?\" asked K. \"I don't know how you\nmean,\" said the businessman, \"he's been my business lawyer--I buy and\nsell cereals--he's been my business lawyer since I took the business\nover, and that's about twenty years now, but perhaps you mean my own\ntrial and he's been representing me in that since it started, and\nthat's been more than five years. Yes, well over five years,\" he then\nadded, pulling out an old briefcase, \"I've got everything written down;\nI can tell you the exact dates if you like. It's so hard to remember\neverything. Probably, my trial's been going on much longer than that,\nit started soon after the death of my wife, and that's been more than\nfive and a half years now.\" K. moved in closer to him. \"So the lawyer\ntakes on ordinary legal business, does he?\" he asked. This combination\nof criminal and commercial business seemed surprisingly reassuring for\nK. \"Oh yes,\" said the businessman, and then he whispered, \"They even\nsay he's more efficient in jurisprudence than he is in other matters.\"\nBut then he seemed to regret saying this, and he laid a hand on K.'s\nshoulder and said, \"Please don't betray me to him, will you.\" K. patted\nhis thigh to reassure him and said, \"No, I don't betray people.\" \"He\ncan be so vindictive, you see,\" said the businessman. \"I'm sure he won't\ndo anything against such a faithful client as you,\" said K. \"Oh, he\nmight do,\" said the businessman, \"when he gets cross it doesn't matter\nwho it is, and anyway, I'm not really faithful to him.\" \"How's that\nthen?\" asked K. \"I'm not sure I should tell you about it,\" said the\nbusinessman hesitantly. \"I think it'll be alright,\" said K. \"Well then,\"\nsaid the businessman, \"I'll tell you about some of it, but you'll have\nto tell me a secret too, then we can support each other with the\nlawyer.\" \"You are very careful,\" said K., \"but I'll tell you a secret\nthat will set your mind completely at ease. Now tell me, in what way\nhave you been unfaithful to the lawyer?\" \"I've ...\" said the businessman\nhesitantly, and in a tone as if he were confessing something\ndishonourable, \"I've taken on other lawyers besides him.\" \"That's not so\nserious,\" said K., a little disappointed. \"It is, here,\" said the\nbusinessman, who had had some difficulty breathing since making his\nconfession but who now, after hearing K.'s comment, began to feel more\ntrust for him. \"That's not allowed. And it's allowed least of all to\ntake on petty lawyers when you've already got a proper one. And that's\njust what I have done, besides him I've got five petty lawyers.\" \"Five!\"\nexclaimed K., astonished at this number, \"Five lawyers besides this\none?\" The businessman nodded. \"I'm even negotiating with a sixth one.\"\n\"But why do you need so many lawyers?\" asked K. \"I need all of them,\"\nsaid the businessman. \"Would you mind explaining that to me?\" asked K.\n\"I'd be glad to,\" said the businessman. \"Most of all, I don't want to\nlose my case, well that's obvious. So that means I mustn't neglect\nanything that might be of use to me; even if there's very little hope of\na particular thing being of any use I can't just throw it away. So\neverything I have I've put to use in my case. I've taken all the money\nout of my business, for example, the offices for my business used to\noccupy nearly a whole floor, but now all I need is a little room at the\nback where I work with one apprentice. It wasn't just using up the money\nthat caused the difficulty, of course, it was much more to do with me\nnot working at the business as much as I used to.

            "text": "what I want to learn more about.\" \"I can't tell you very much about\nthat,\" said the businessman, \"at first I tried to do that too but I soon\nhad to give it up again. It wears you out too much, and it's really not\nmuch use. And it turned out to be quite impossible to work there\nyourself and to negotiate, at least for me it was. It's a heavy strain\nthere just sitting and waiting. You know yourself what the air is like\nin those offices.\" \"How do you know I've been there, then?\" asked K. \"I\nwas in the waiting room myself when you went through.\" \"What a\ncoincidence that is!\" exclaimed K., totally engrossed and forgetting how\nridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier. \"So you saw me!\nYou were in the waiting room when I went through. Yes, I did go through\nit one time.\" \"It isn't such a big coincidence,\" said the businessman,\n\"I'm there nearly every day.\" \"I expect I'll have to go there quite\noften myself now,\" said K., \"although I can hardly expect to be shown\nthe same respect as I was then. They all stood up for me. They must have\nthought I was a judge.\" \"No,\" said the businessman, \"we were greeting\nthe servant of the court. We knew you were a defendant. That sort of\nnews spreads very quickly.\" \"So you already knew about that,\" said K.,\n\"the way I behaved must have seemed very arrogant to you. Did you\ncriticise me for it afterwards?\" \"No,\" said the businessman, \"quite the\nopposite. That was just stupidity.\" \"What do you mean, 'stupidity'?\"\nasked K. \"Why are you asking about it?\" said the businessman in some\nirritation. \"You still don't seem to know the people there and you might\ntake it wrong. Don't forget in proceedings like this there are always\nlots of different things coming up to talk about, things that you just\ncan't understand with reason alone, you just get too tired and\ndistracted for most things and so, instead, people rely on superstition.\nI'm talking about the others, but I'm no better myself. One of these\nsuperstitions, for example, is that you can learn a lot about the\noutcome of a defendant's case by looking at his face, especially the\nshape of his lips. There are lots who believe that, and they said they\ncould see from the shape of your lips that you'd definitely be found\nguilty very soon. I repeat that all this is just a ridiculous\nsuperstition, and in most cases it's completely disproved by the facts,\nbut when you live in that society it's hard to hold yourself back from\nbeliefs like that. Just think how much effect that superstition can\nhave. You spoke to one of them there, didn't you? He was hardly able to\ngive you an answer. There are lots of things there that can make you\nconfused, of course, but one of them, for him, was the appearance of\nyour lips. He told us all later he thought he could see something in\nyour lips that meant he'd be convicted himself.\" \"On my lips?\" asked K.,\npulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself. \"I can see nothing\nspecial about my lips. Can you?\" \"Nor can I,\" said the businessman,\n\"nothing at all.\" \"These people are so superstitious!\" exclaimed K.\n\"Isn't that what I just told you?\" asked the businessman. \"Do you then\nhave that much contact with each other, exchanging each other's\nopinions?\" said K. \"I've kept myself completely apart so far.\" \"They\ndon't normally have much contact with each other,\" said the businessman,\n\"that would be impossible, there are so many of them. And they don't\nhave much in common either. If a group of them ever thinks they have\nfound something in common it soon turns out they were mistaken. There's\nnothing you can do as a group where the court's concerned. Each case is\nexamined separately, the court is very painstaking. So there's nothing\nto be achieved by forming into a group, only sometimes an individual\nwill achieve something in secret; and it's only when that's been done\nthe others learn about it; nobody knows how it was done. So there's no\nsense of togetherness, you meet people now and then in the waiting\nrooms, but we don't talk much there. The superstitious beliefs were\nestablished a long time ago and they spread all by themselves.\" \"I saw\nthose gentlemen in the waiting room,\" said K., \"it seemed so pointless\nfor them to be waiting in that way.\" \"Waiting is not pointless,\" said\nthe businessman, \"it's only pointless if you try and interfere yourself.\nI told you just now I've got five lawyers besides this one. You might\nthink--I thought it myself at first--you might think I could leave the\nwhole thing entirely up to them now. That would be entirely wrong. I can\nleave it up to them less than when I had just the one. Maybe you don't\nunderstand that, do you?\" \"No,\" said K., and to slow the businessman\ndown, who had been speaking too fast, he laid his hand on the\nbusinessman's to reassure him, \"but I'd like just to ask you to speak a\nlittle more slowly, these are many very important things for me, and I\ncan't follow exactly what you're saying.\" \"You're quite right to remind\nme of that,\" said the businessman, \"you're new to all this, a junior.\nYour trial is six months old, isn't it. Yes, I've heard about it. Such a\nnew case! But I've already thought all these things through countless\ntimes, to me they're the most obvious things in the world.\" \"You must be\nglad your trial has already progressed so far, are you?\" asked K., he\ndid not wish to ask directly how the businessman's affairs stood, but\nreceived no clear answer anyway. \"Yes, I've been working at my trial for\nfive years now,\" said the businessman as his head sank, \"that's no small\nachievement.\" Then he was silent for a while. K. listened to hear\nwhether Leni was on her way back. On the one hand he did not want her to\ncome back too soon as he still had many questions to ask and did not\nwant her to find him in this intimate discussion with the businessman,\nbut on the other hand it irritated him that she stayed so long with the\nlawyer when K. was there, much longer than she needed to give him his\nsoup. \"I still remember it exactly,\" the businessman began again, and K.\nimmediately gave him his full attention, \"when my case was as old as\nyours is now. I only had this one lawyer at that time but I wasn't very\nsatisfied with him.\" Now I'll find out everything, thought K., nodding\nvigorously as if he could thereby encourage the businessman to say\neverything worth knowing. \"My case,\" the businessman continued, \"didn't\nmove on at all, there were some hearings that took place and I went to\nevery one of them, collected materials, handed all my business books to\nthe court--which I later found was entirely unnecessary--I ran back and\nforth to the lawyer, and he submitted various documents to the court\ntoo....\" \"Various documents?\" asked K. \"Yes, that's right,\" said the\nbusinessman. \"That's very important for me,\" said K., \"in my case he's\nstill working on the first set of documents. He still hasn't done\nanything. I see now that he's been neglecting me quite disgracefully.\"\n\"There can be lots of good reasons why the first documents still aren't\nready,\" said the businessman, \"and anyway, it turned out later on that\nthe ones he submitted for me were entirely worthless. I even read one of\nthem myself, one of the officials at the court was very helpful. It was\nvery learned, but it didn't actually say anything. Most of all, there\nwas lots of Latin, which I can't understand, then pages and pages of\ngeneral appeals to the court, then lots of flattery for particular\nofficials, they weren't named, these officials, but anyone familiar with\nthe court must have been able to guess who they were, then there was\nself-praise by the lawyer where he humiliated himself to the court in a\nway that was downright dog-like, and then endless investigations of\ncases from the past which were supposed to be similar to mine. Although,\nas far as I was able to follow them, these investigations had been\ncarried out very carefully. Now, I don't mean to criticise the lawyer's\nwork with all of this, and the document I read was only one of many, but\neven so, and this is something I will say, at that time I couldn't see\nany progress in my trial at all.\" \"And what sort of progress had you\nbeen hoping for?\" asked K. \"That's a very sensible question,\" said the\nbusinessman with a smile, \"it's only very rare that you see any progress\nin these proceedings at all. But I didn't know that then. I'm a\nbusinessman, much more in those days than now, I wanted to see some\ntangible progress, it should have all been moving to some conclusion or\nat least should have been moving on in some way according to the rules.\nInstead of which there were just more hearings, and most of them went\nthrough the same things anyway; I had all the answers off pat like in a\nchurch service; there were messengers from the court coming to me at\nwork several times a week, or they came to me at home or anywhere else\nthey could find me; and that was very disturbing of course (but at least\nnow things are better in that respect, it's much less disturbing when\nthey contact you by telephone), and rumours about my trial even started\nto spread among some of the people I do business with, and especially my\nrelations, so I was being made to suffer in many different ways but\nthere was still not the slightest sign that even the first hearing would\ntake place soon. So I went to the lawyer and complained about it. He\nexplained it all to me at length, but refused to do anything I asked\nfor, no-one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds, he said, to\ntry and insist on it in any of the documents submitted--like I was\nasking--was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me. I\nthought to myself: What this lawyer can't or won't do another lawyer\nwill. So I looked round for other lawyers. And before you say anything:\nnone of them asked for a definite date for the main trial and none of\nthem got one, and anyway, apart from one exception which I'll talk about\nin a minute, it really is impossible, that's one thing this lawyer\ndidn't mislead me about; but besides, I had no reason to regret turning\nto other lawyers. Perhaps you've already heard how Dr. Huld talks about\nthe petty lawyers, he probably made them sound very contemptible to you,\nand he's right, they are contemptible. But when he talks about them and\ncompares them with himself and his colleagues there's a small error\nrunning through what he says, and, just for your interest, I'll tell you\nabout it. When he talks about the lawyers he mixes with he sets them\napart by calling them the 'great lawyers'. That's wrong, anyone can call\nhimself 'great' if he wants to, of course, but in this case only the\nusage of the court can make that distinction. You see, the court says\nthat besides the petty lawyers there are also minor lawyers and great\nlawyers. This one and his colleagues are only minor lawyers, and the\ndifference in rank between them and the great lawyers, who I've only\never heard about and never seen, is incomparably greater than between\nthe minor lawyers and the despised petty lawyers.\" \"The great lawyers?\"\nasked K. \"Who are they then? How do you contact them?\" \"You've never\nheard about them, then?\" said the businessman. \"There's hardly anyone\nwho's been accused who doesn't spend a lot of time dreaming about the\ngreat lawyers once he's heard about them. It's best if you don't let\nyourself be misled in that way. I don't know who the great lawyers are,\nand there's probably no way of contacting them. I don't know of any case\nI can talk about with certainty where they've taken any part. They do\ndefend a lot of people, but you can't get hold of them by your own\nefforts, they only defend those who they want to defend. And I don't\nsuppose they ever take on cases that haven't already got past the lower\ncourts. Anyway, it's best not to think about them, as if you do it makes\nthe discussions with the other lawyers, all their advice and all that\nthey do manage to achieve, seem so unpleasant and useless, I had that\nexperience myself, just wanted to throw everything away and lay at home\nin bed and hear nothing more about it. But that, of course, would be the\nstupidest thing you could do, and you wouldn't be left in peace in bed\nfor very long either.\" \"So you weren't thinking about the great lawyers\nat that time?\" asked K. \"Not for very long,\" said the businessman, and\nsmiled again, \"you can't forget about them entirely, I'm afraid,\nespecially in the night when these thoughts come so easily. But I wanted\nimmediate results in those days, so I went to the petty lawyers.\"\n\"Well look at you two sat huddled together!\" called Leni as she came\nback with the dish and stood in the doorway. They were indeed sat close\ntogether, if either of them turned his head even slightly it would have\nknocked against the other's, the businessman was not only very small\nbut also sat hunched down, so that K. was also forced to bend down low\nif he wanted to hear everything. \"Not quite yet!\" called out K., to turn\nLeni away, his hand, still resting on the businessman's hand, twitching\nwith impatience. \"He wanted me to tell him about my trial,\" said the\nbusinessman to Leni. \"Carry on, then, carry on,\" she said. She spoke to\nthe businessman with affection but, at the same time, with\ncondescension. K. did not like that, he had begun to learn that the man\nwas of some value after all, he had experience at least, and he was\nwilling to share it. Leni was probably wrong about him. He watched her\nin irritation as Leni now took the candle from the businessman's\nhand--which he had been holding on to all this time--wiped his hand\nwith her apron and then knelt beside him to scratch off some wax that\nhad dripped from the candle onto his trousers. \"You were about to tell\nme about the petty lawyers,\" said K., shoving Leni's hand away with no\nfurther comment. \"What's wrong with you today?\" asked Leni, tapped him\ngently and carried on with what she had been doing. \"Yes, the petty\nlawyers,\" said the businessman, putting his hand to his brow as if\nthinking hard. K. wanted to help him and said, \"You wanted immediate\nresults and so went to the petty lawyers.\" \"Yes, that's right,\" said\nthe businessman, but did not continue with what he'd been saying. \"Maybe\nhe doesn't want to speak about it in front of Leni,\" thought K.,\nsuppressing his impatience to hear the rest straight away, and stopped\ntrying to press him.\n\"Have you told him I'm here?\" he asked Leni. \"Course I have,\" she said,\n\"he's waiting for you. Leave Block alone now, you can talk to Block\nlater, he'll still be here.\" K. still hesitated. \"You'll still be\nhere?\" he asked the businessman, wanting to hear the answer from him and\nnot wanting Leni to speak about the businessman as if he weren't there,\nhe was full of secret resentment towards Leni today. And once more it\nwas only Leni who answered. \"He often sleeps here.\" \"He sleeps here?\"\nexclaimed K., he had thought the businessman would just wait there for\nhim while he quickly settled his business with the lawyer, and then\nthey would leave together to discuss everything thoroughly and\nundisturbed. \"Yes,\" said Leni, \"not everyone's like you, Josef, allowed\nto see the lawyer at any time you like. Don't even seem surprised that\nthe lawyer, despite being ill, still receives you at eleven o'clock at\nnight. You take it far too much for granted, what your friends do for\nyou. Well, your friends, or at least I do, we like to do things for you.\nI don't want or need any more thanks than that you're fond of me.\" \"Fond\nof you?\" thought K. at first, and only then it occurred to him, \"Well,\nyes, I am fond of her.\" Nonetheless, what he said, forgetting all the\nrest, was, \"He receives me because I am his client. If I needed anyone\nelse's help I'd have to beg and show gratitude whenever I do anything.\"\n\"He's really nasty today, isn't he?\" Leni asked the businessman. \"Now\nit's me who's not here,\" thought K., and nearly lost his temper with\nthe businessman when, with the same rudeness as Leni, he said, \"The\nlawyer also has other reasons to receive him. His case is much more\ninteresting than mine. And it's only in its early stages too, it\nprobably hasn't progressed very far so the lawyer still likes to deal\nwith him. That'll all change later on.\" \"Yeah, yeah,\" said Leni, looking\nat the businessman and laughing. \"He doesn't half talk!\" she said,\nturning to face K. \"You can't believe a word he says. He's as talkative\nas he is sweet. Maybe that's why the lawyer can't stand him. At least,\nhe only sees him when he's in the right mood. I've already tried hard to\nchange that but it's impossible. Just think, there are times when I tell\nhim Block's here and he doesn't receive him until three days later. And\nif Block isn't on the spot when he's called then everything's lost and\nit all has to start all over again. That's why I let Block sleep here,\nit wouldn't be the first time Dr. Huld has wanted to see him in the\nnight. So now Block is ready for that. Sometimes, when he knows Block is\nstill here, he'll even change his mind about letting him in to see him.\"\nK. looked questioningly at the businessman. The latter nodded and,\nalthough he had spoken quite openly with K. earlier, seemed to be\nconfused with shame as he said, \"Yes, later on you become very dependent\non your lawyer.\" \"He's only pretending to mind,\" said Leni. \"He likes to\nsleep here really, he's often said so.\" She went over to a little door\nand shoved it open. \"Do you want to see his bedroom?\" she asked. K.\nwent over to the low, windowless room and looked in from the doorway.\nThe room contained a narrow bed which filled it completely, so that to\nget into the bed you would need to climb over the bedpost. At the head\nof the bed there was a niche in the wall where, fastidiously tidy, stood\na candle, a bottle of ink, and a pen with a bundle of papers which were\nprobably to do with the trial. \"You sleep in the maid's room?\" asked\nK., as he went back to the businessman. \"Leni's let me have it,\"\nanswered the businessman, \"it has many advantages.\" K. looked long at\nhim; his first impression of the businessman had perhaps not been right;\nhe had experience as his trial had already lasted a long time, but he\nhad paid a heavy price for this experience. K. was suddenly unable to\nbear the sight of the businessman any longer. \"Bring him to bed, then!\"\nhe called out to Leni, who seemed to understand him. For himself, he\nwanted to go to the lawyer and, by dismissing him, free himself from not\nonly the lawyer but also from Leni and the businessman. But before he\nhad reached the door the businessman spoke to him gently. \"Excuse me,\nsir,\" he said, and K. looked round crossly. \"You've forgotten your\npromise,\" said the businessman, stretching his hand out to K.\nimploringly from where he sat. \"You were going to tell me a secret.\"\n\"That is true,\" said K., as he glanced at Leni, who was watching him\ncarefully, to check on her. \"So listen; it's hardly a secret now anyway.\nI'm going to see the lawyer now to sack him.\" \"He's sacking him!\" yelled\nthe businessman, and he jumped up from his chair and ran around the\nkitchen with his arms in the air. He kept on shouting, \"He's sacking his\nlawyer!\" Leni tried to rush at K. but the businessman got in her way so\nthat she shoved him away with her fists. Then, still with her hands\nballed into fists, she ran after K. who, however, had been given a long\nstart. He was already inside the lawyer's room by the time Leni caught\nup with him. He had almost closed the door behind himself, but Leni held\nthe door open with her foot, grabbed his arm and tried to pull him back.\nBut he put such pressure on her wrist that, with a sigh, she was forced\nto release him. She did not dare go into the room straight away, and K.\nlocked the door with the key.",

He had been reading something by the light of a candle but now he\nlaid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on, looking at K.\nsharply through them. Instead of apologising K. said, \"I'll be leaving\nagain soon.\" As he had not apologised the lawyer ignored what K. said,\nand replied, \"I won't let you in this late again next time.\" \"I find\nthat quite acceptable,\" said K. The lawyer looked at him quizzically.\n\"Sit down,\" he said. \"As you wish,\" said K., drawing a chair up to the\nbedside table and sitting down. \"It seemed to me that you locked the\ndoor,\" said the lawyer. \"Yes,\" said K., \"it was because of Leni.\" He\nhad no intention of letting anyone off lightly. But the lawyer asked\nhim, \"Was she being importunate again?\" \"Importunate?\" asked K. \"Yes,\"\nsaid the lawyer, laughing as he did so, had a fit of coughing and then,\nonce it had passed, began to laugh again. \"I'm sure you must have\nnoticed how importunate she can be sometimes,\" he said, and patted K.'s\nhand which K. had rested on the bedside table and which he now snatched\nback. \"You don't attach much importance to it, then,\" said the lawyer\nwhen K. was silent, \"so much the better. Otherwise I might have needed\nto apologise to you. It is a peculiarity of Leni's. I've long since\nforgiven her for it, and I wouldn't be talking of it now, if you hadn't\nlocked the door just now. Anyway, perhaps I should at least explain this\npeculiarity of hers to you, but you seem rather disturbed, the way\nyou're looking at me, and so that's why I'll do it, this peculiarity of\nhers consists in this: Leni finds most of the accused attractive. She\nattaches herself to each of them, loves each of them, even seems to be\nloved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling me\nabout them when I allow her to. I am not so astonished by all of this as\nyou seem to be. If you look at them in the right way the accused really\ncan be attractive, quite often. But that is a remarkable and to some\nextent scientific phenomenon. Being indicted does not cause any clear,\nprecisely definable change in a person's appearance, of course. But\nit's not like with other legal matters, most of them remain in their\nusual way of life and, if they have a good lawyer looking after them,\nthe trial doesn't get in their way. But there are nonetheless those who\nhave experience in these matters who can look at a crowd, however big,\nand tell you which among them is facing a charge. How can they do that,\nyou will ask? My answer will not please you. It is simply that those who\nare facing a charge are the most attractive. It cannot be their guilt\nthat makes them attractive as not all of them are guilty--at least\nthat's what I, as a lawyer, have to say--and nor can it be the proper\npunishment that has made them attractive as not all of them are\npunished, so it can only be that the proceedings levelled against them\ntake some kind of hold on them. Whatever the reason, some of these\nattractive people are indeed very attractive. But all of them are\nattractive, even Block, pitiful worm that he is.\" As the lawyer\nfinished what he was saying, K. was fully in control of himself, he had\neven nodded conspicuously at his last few words in order to confirm to\nhimself the view he had already formed: that the lawyer was trying to\nconfuse him, as he always did, by making general and irrelevant\nobservations, and thus distract him from the main question of what he\nwas actually doing for K.'s trial. The lawyer must have noticed that K.\nwas offering him more resistance than before, as he became silent,\ngiving K. the chance to speak himself, and then, as K. also remained\nsilent, he asked, \"Did you have a particular reason for coming to see\nme today?\" \"Yes,\" said K., putting his hand up to slightly shade his\neyes from the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer\nbetter, \"I wanted to tell you that I'm withdrawing my representation\nfrom you, with immediate effect.\" \"Do I understand you rightly?\" asked\nthe lawyer as he half raised himself in his bed and supported himself\nwith one hand on the pillow. \"I think you do,\" said K., sitting stiffly\nupright as if waiting in ambush. \"Well we can certainly discuss this\nplan of yours,\" said the lawyer after a pause. \"It's not a plan any\nmore,\" said K. \"That may be,\" said the lawyer, \"but we still mustn't\nrush anything.\" He used the word 'we', as if he had no intention of\nletting K. go free, and as if, even if he could no longer represent him,\nhe could still at least continue as his adviser. \"Nothing is being\nrushed,\" said K., standing slowly up and going behind his chair,\n\"everything has been well thought out and probably even for too long.\nThe decision is final.\" \"Then allow me to say a few words,\" said the\nlawyer, throwing the bed cover to one side and sitting on the edge of\nthe bed. His naked, white-haired legs shivered in the cold. He asked K.\nto pass him a blanket from the couch. K. passed him the blanket and\nsaid, \"You are running the risk of catching cold for no reason.\" \"The\ncircumstances are important enough,\" said the lawyer as he wrapped the\nbed cover around the top half of his body and then the blanket around\nhis legs. \"Your uncle is my friend and in the course of time I've become\nfond of you as well. I admit that quite openly. There's nothing in that\nfor me to be ashamed of.\" It was very unwelcome for K. to hear the old\nman speak in this touching way, as it forced him to explain himself more\nfully, which he would rather have avoided, and he was aware that it also\nconfused him even though it could never make him reverse his decision.\n\"Thank you for feeling so friendly toward me,\" he said, \"and I also\nrealise how deeply involved you've been in my case, as deeply as\npossible for yourself and to bring as much advantage as possible to me.\nNonetheless, I have recently come to the conviction that it is not\nenough. I would naturally never attempt, considering that you are so\nmuch older and more experienced than I am, to convince you of my\nopinion; if I have ever unintentionally done so then I beg your\nforgiveness, but, as you have just said yourself, the circumstances are\nimportant enough and it is my belief that my trial needs to be\napproached with much more vigour than has so far been the case.\" \"I\nsee,\" said the lawyer, \"you've become impatient.\" \"I am not impatient,\"\nsaid K., with some irritation and he stopped paying so much attention to\nhis choice of words. \"When I first came here with my uncle you probably\nnoticed I wasn't greatly concerned about my case, and if I wasn't\nreminded of it by force, as it were, I would forget about it completely.\nBut my uncle insisted I should allow you to represent me and I did so as\na favour to him. I could have expected the case to be less of a burden\nthan it had been, as the point of taking on a lawyer is that he should\ntake on some of its weight. But what actually happened was the opposite.\nBefore, the trial was never such a worry for me as it has been since\nyou've been representing me. When I was by myself I never did anything\nabout my case, I was hardly aware of it, but then, once there was\nsomeone representing me, everything was set for something to happen, I\nwas always, without cease, waiting for you to do something, getting more\nand more tense, but you did nothing. I did get some information about\nthe court from you that I probably could not have got anywhere else, but\nthat can't be enough when the trial, supposedly in secret, is getting\ncloser and closer to me.\" K. had pushed the chair away and stood erect,\nhis hands in the pockets of his frock coat. \"After a certain point in\nthe proceedings,\" said the lawyer quietly and calmly, \"nothing new of\nany importance ever happens. So many litigants, at the same stage in\ntheir trials, have stood before me just like you are now and spoken in\nthe same way.\" \"Then these other litigants,\" said K., \"have all been\nright, just as I am. That does not show that I'm not.\" \"I wasn't trying\nto show that you were mistaken,\" said the lawyer, \"but I wanted to add\nthat I expected better judgement from you than from the others,\nespecially as I've given you more insight into the workings of the court\nand my own activities than I normally do. And now I'm forced to accept\nthat, despite everything, you have too little trust in me. You don't\nmake it easy for me.\" How the lawyer was humiliating himself to K.! He\nwas showing no regard for the dignity of his position, which on this\npoint, must have been at its most sensitive. And why did he do that? He\ndid seem to be very busy as a lawyer as well a rich man, neither the\nloss of income nor the loss of a client could have been of much\nimportance to him in themselves. He was moreover unwell and should have\nbeen thinking of passing work on to others. And despite all that he held\non tightly to K. Why? Was it something personal for his uncle's sake, or\ndid he really see K.'s case as one that was exceptional and hoped to be\nable to distinguish himself with it, either for K.'s sake or--and this\npossibility could never be excluded--for his friends at the court. It\nwas not possible to learn anything by looking at him, even though K. was\nscrutinizing him quite brazenly. It could almost be supposed he was\ndeliberately hiding his thoughts as he waited to see what effect his\nwords would have. But he clearly deemed K.'s silence to be favourable\nfor himself and he continued, \"You will have noticed the size of my\noffice, but that I don't employ any staff to help me. That used to be\nquite different, there was a time when several young lawyers were\nworking for me but now I work alone. This is partly to do with changes\nin the way I do business, in that I concentrate nowadays more and more\non matters such as your own case, and partly to do with the ever deeper\nunderstanding that I acquire from these legal matters. I found that I\ncould never let anyone else deal with this sort of work unless I wanted\nto harm both the client and the job I had taken on. But the decision to\ndo all the work myself had its obvious result: I was forced to turn\nalmost everyone away who asked me to represent them and could only\naccept those I was especially interested in--well there are enough\ncreatures who leap at every crumb I throw down, and they're not so very\nfar away. Most importantly, I became ill from over-work. But despite\nthat I don't regret my decision, quite possibly I should have turned\nmore cases away than I did, but it did turn out to be entirely necessary\nfor me to devote myself fully to the cases I did take on, and the\nsuccessful results showed that it was worth it. I once read a\ndescription of the difference between representing someone in ordinary\nlegal matters and in legal matters of this sort, and the writer\nexpressed it very well. This is what he said: some lawyers lead their\nclients on a thread until judgement is passed, but there are others who\nimmediately lift their clients onto their shoulders and carry them all\nthe way to the judgement and beyond. That's just how it is. But it was\nquite true when I said I never regret all this work. But if, as in your\ncase, they are so fully misunderstood, well, then I come very close to\nregretting it.\" All this talking did more to make K. impatient than to\npersuade him. From the way the lawyer was speaking, K. thought he could\nhear what he could expect if he gave in, the delays and excuses would\nbegin again, reports of how the documents were progressing, how the mood\nof the court officials had improved, as well as all the enormous\ndifficulties--in short all that he had heard so many times before would\nbe brought out again even more fully, he would try to mislead K. with\nhopes that were never specified and to make him suffer with threats that\nwere never clear. He had to put a stop to that, so he said, \"What will\nyou undertake on my behalf if you continue to represent me?\" The lawyer\nquietly accepted even this insulting question, and answered, \"I should\ncontinue with what I've already been doing for you.\" \"That's just what I\nthought,\" said K., \"and now you don't need to say another word.\" \"I will\nmake one more attempt,\" said the lawyer as if whatever had been making\nK. so annoyed was affecting him too. \"You see, I have the impression\nthat you have not only misjudged the legal assistance I have given you\nbut also that that misjudgement has led you to behave in this way, you\nseem, although you are the accused, to have been treated too well or, to\nput it a better way, handled with neglect, with apparent neglect. Even\nthat has its reason; it is often better to be in chains than to be free.\nBut I would like to show you how other defendants are treated, perhaps\nyou will succeed in learning something from it. What I will do is I will\ncall Block in, unlock the door and sit down here beside the bedside\ntable.\" \"Be glad to,\" said K., and did as the lawyer suggested; he was\nalways ready to learn something new. But to make sure of himself for any\nevent he added, \"but you do realise that you are no longer to be my\nlawyer, don't you?\" \"Yes,\" said the lawyer. \"But you can still change\nyour mind today if you want to.\" He lay back down in the bed, pulled the\nquilt up to his chin and turned to face the wall. Then he rang.\nLeni appeared almost the moment he had done so. She looked hurriedly at\nK. and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened; she seemed to\nbe reassured by the sight of K. sitting calmly at the lawyer's bed. She\nsmiled and nodded to K., K. looked blankly back at her. \"Fetch Block,\"\nsaid the lawyer. But instead of going to fetch him, Leni just went to\nthe door and called out, \"Block! To the lawyer!\" Then, probably because\nthe lawyer had turned his face to the wall and was paying no attention,\nshe slipped in behind K.'s chair. From then on, she bothered him by\nleaning forward over the back of the chair or, albeit very tenderly and\ncarefully, she would run her hands through his hair and over his\ncheeks. K. eventually tried to stop her by taking hold of one hand, and\nafter some resistance Leni let him keep hold of it. Block came as soon\nas he was called, but he remained standing in the doorway and seemed to\nbe wondering whether he should enter or not. He raised his eyebrows and\nlowered his head as if listening to find out whether the order to\nattend the lawyer would be repeated. K. could have encouraged him to\nenter, but he had decided to make a final break not only with the\nlawyer but with everything in his home, so he kept himself motionless.\nLeni was also silent. Block noticed that at least no-one was chasing\nhim away, and, on tiptoe, he entered the room, his face was tense, his\nhands were clenched behind his back. He left the door open in case he\nneeded to go back again. K. did not even glance at him, he looked\ninstead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could not be seen\nas he had squeezed up very close to the wall. Then his voice was heard:\n\"Block here?\" he asked. Block had already crept some way into the room\nbut this question seemed to give him first a shove in the breast and\nthen another in the back, he seemed about to fall but remained\nstanding, deeply bowed, and said, \"At your service, sir.\" \"What do you\nwant?\" asked the lawyer, \"you've come at a bad time.\" \"Wasn't I\nsummoned?\" asked Block, more to himself than the lawyer. He held his\nhands in front of himself as protection and would have been ready to run\naway any moment. \"You were summoned,\" said the lawyer, \"but you have\nstill come at a bad time.\" Then, after a pause he added, \"You always\ncome at a bad time.\" When the lawyer started speaking Block had stopped\nlooking at the bed but stared rather into one of the corners, just\nlistening, as if the light from the speaker were brighter than Block\ncould bear to look at. But it was also difficult for him to listen, as\nthe lawyer was speaking into the wall and speaking quickly and quietly.\n\"Would you like me to go away again, sir?\" asked Block. \"Well you're\nhere now,\" said the lawyer. \"Stay!\" It was as if the lawyer had not done\nas Block had wanted but instead threatened him with a stick, as now\nBlock really began to shake. \"I went to see,\" said the lawyer, \"the\nthird judge yesterday, a friend of mine, and slowly brought the\nconversation round to the subject of you. Do you want to know what he\nsaid?\" \"Oh, yes please,\" said Block. The lawyer did not answer\nimmediately, so Block repeated his request and lowered his head as if\nabout to kneel down. But then K. spoke to him: \"What do you think you're\ndoing?\" he shouted. Leni had wanted to stop him from calling out and so\nhe took hold of her other hand. It was not love that made him squeeze it\nand hold on to it so tightly, she sighed frequently and tried to\ndisengage her hands from him. But Block was punished for K.'s outburst,\nas the lawyer asked him, \"Who is your lawyer?\" \"You are, sir,\" said\nBlock. \"And who besides me?\" the lawyer asked. \"No-one besides you,\nsir,\" said Block. \"And let there be no-one besides me,\" said the lawyer.\nBlock fully understood what that meant, he glowered at K., shaking his\nhead violently. If these actions had been translated into words they\nwould have been coarse insults. K. had been friendly and willing to\ndiscuss his own case with someone like this! \"I won't disturb you any\nmore,\" said K., leaning back in his chair. \"You can kneel down or creep\non all fours, whatever you like. I won't bother with you any more.\" But\nBlock still had some sense of pride, at least where K. was concerned,\nand he went towards him waving his fists, shouting as loudly as he dared\nwhile the lawyer was there. \"You shouldn't speak to me like that, that's\nnot allowed. Why are you insulting me? Especially here in front of the\nlawyer, where both of us, you and me, we're only tolerated because of\nhis charity. You're not a better person than me, you've been accused of\nsomething too, you're facing a charge too. If, in spite of that, you're\nstill a gentleman then I'm just as much a gentleman as you are, if not\neven more so. And I want to be spoken to as a gentleman, especially by\nyou. If you think being allowed to sit there and quietly listen while I\ncreep on all fours as you put it makes you something better than me,\nthen there's an old legal saying you ought to bear in mind: If you're\nunder suspicion it's better to be moving than still, as if you're still\nyou can be in the pan of the scales without knowing it and be weighed\nalong with your sins.\" K. said nothing. He merely looked in amazement at\nthis distracted being, his eyes completely still. He had gone through\nsuch changes in just the last few hours! Was it the trial that was\nthrowing him from side to side in this way and stopped him knowing who\nwas friend and who was foe? Could he not see the lawyer was deliberately\nhumiliating him and had no other purpose today than to show off his\npower to K., and perhaps even thereby subjugate K.? But if Block was\nincapable of seeing that, or if he so feared the lawyer that no such\ninsight would even be of any use to him, how was it that he was either\nso sly or so bold as to lie to the lawyer and conceal from him the fact\nthat he had other lawyers working on his behalf? And how did he dare to\nattack K., who could betray his secret any time he liked? But he dared\neven more than this, he went to the lawyer's bed and began there to make\ncomplaints about K. \"Dr. Huld, sir,\" he said, \"did you hear the way this\nman spoke to me? You can count the length of his trial in hours, and he\nwants to tell me what to do when I've been involved in a legal case for\nfive years. He even insults me. He doesn't know anything, but he insults\nme, when I, as far as my weak ability allows, when I've made a close\nstudy of how to behave with the court, what we ought to do and what the\ncourt practices are.\" \"Don't let anyone bother you,\" said the lawyer,\n\"and do what seems to you to be right.\" \"I will,\" said Block, as if\nspeaking to himself to give himself courage, and with a quick glance to\nthe side he knelt down close beside the bed. \"I'm kneeling now, Dr.\nHuld, sir,\" he said. But the lawyer remained silent. With one hand,\nBlock carefully stroked the bed cover. In the silence while he did so,\nLeni, as she freed herself from K.'s hands, said, \"You're hurting me.\nLet go of me. I'm going over to Block.\" She went over to him and sat on\nthe edge of the bed. Block was very pleased at this and with lively,\nbut silent, gestures he immediately urged her to intercede for him with\nthe lawyer. It was clear that he desperately needed to be told something\nby the lawyer, although perhaps only so that he could make use of the\ninformation with his other lawyers. Leni probably knew very well how\nthe lawyer could be brought round, pointed to his hand and pursed her\nlips as if making a kiss. Block immediately performed the hand-kiss and,\nat further urging from Leni, repeated it twice more. But the lawyer",

            "text": "In the Cathedral\nA very important Italian business contact of the bank had come to visit\nthe city for the first time and K. was given the task of showing him\nsome of its cultural sights. At any other time he would have seen this\njob as an honour but now, when he was finding it hard even to maintain\nhis current position in the bank, he accepted it only with reluctance.\nEvery hour that he could not be in the office was a cause of concern\nfor him, he was no longer able to make use of his time in the office\nanything like as well as he had previously, he spent many hours merely\npretending to do important work, but that only increased his anxiety\nabout not being in the office. Then he sometimes thought he saw the\ndeputy director, who was always watching, come into K.'s office, sit at\nhis desk, look through his papers, receive clients who had almost\nbecome old friends of K., and lure them away from him, perhaps he even\ndiscovered mistakes, mistakes that seemed to threaten K. from a\nthousand directions when he was at work now, and which he could no\nlonger avoid. So now, if he was ever asked to leave the office on\nbusiness or even needed to make a short business trip, however much an\nhonour it seemed--and tasks of this sort happened to have increased\nsubstantially recently--there was always the suspicion that they wanted\nto get him out of his office for a while and check his work, or at\nleast the idea that they thought he was dispensable. It would not have\nbeen difficult for him to turn down most of these jobs, but he did not\ndare to do so because, if his fears had the slightest foundation,\nturning the jobs down would have been an acknowledgement of them. For\nthis reason, he never demurred from accepting them, and even when he\nwas asked to go on a tiring business trip lasting two days he said\nnothing about having to go out in the rainy autumn weather when he had a\nsevere chill, just in order to avoid the risk of not being asked to go.\nWhen, with a raging headache, he arrived back from this trip he learned\nthat he had been chosen to accompany the Italian business contact the\nfollowing day. The temptation for once to turn the job down was very\ngreat, especially as it had no direct connection with business, but\nthere was no denying that social obligations towards this business\ncontact were in themselves important enough, only not for K., who knew\nquite well that he needed some successes at work if he was to maintain\nhis position there and that, if he failed in that, it would not help\nhim even if this Italian somehow found him quite charming; he did not\nwant to be removed from his workplace for even one day, as the fear of\nnot being allowed back in was too great, he knew full well that the fear\nwas exaggerated but it still made him anxious. However, in this case it\nwas almost impossible to think of an acceptable excuse, his knowledge\nof Italian was not great but still good enough; the deciding factor was\nthat K. had earlier known a little about art history and this had\nbecome widely known around the bank in extremely exaggerated form, and\nthat K. had been a member of the Society for the Preservation of City\nMonuments, albeit only for business reasons. It was said that this\nItalian was an art lover, so the choice of K. to accompany him was a\nmatter of course.\nIt was a very rainy and stormy morning when K., in a foul temper at the\nthought of the day ahead of him, arrived early at seven o'clock in the\noffice so that he could at least do some work before his visitor would\nprevent him. He had spent half the night studying a book of Italian\ngrammar so that he would be somewhat prepared and was very tired; his\ndesk was less attractive to him than the window where he had spent far\ntoo much time sitting of late, but he resisted the temptation and sat\ndown to his work. Unfortunately, just then the servitor came in and\nreported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief clerk\nwas already in his office; if he was, then would he please be so kind\nas to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was\nalready there. \"I'll come straight away,\" said K. He put a small\ndictionary in his pocket, took a guide to the city's tourist sites\nunder his arm that he had compiled for strangers, and went through the",

            "text": "deputy director's office into that of the director. He was glad he had\ncome into the office so early and was able to be of service\nimmediately, nobody could seriously have expected that of him. The\ndeputy director's office was, of course, still as empty as the middle\nof the night, the servitor had probably been asked to summon him too\nbut without success. As K. entered the reception room two men stood up\nfrom the deep armchairs where they had been sitting. The director gave\nhim a friendly smile, he was clearly very glad that K. was there, he\nimmediately introduced him to the Italian who shook K.'s hand\nvigorously and joked that somebody was an early riser. K. did not quite\nunderstand whom he had in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use\nand it took K. a little while to guess its meaning. He replied with a\nfew bland phrases which the Italian received once more with a laugh,\npassing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his blue-grey, bushy\nmoustache. This moustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting\nto come close to it and sniff. When they had all sat down and begun a\nlight preliminary conversation, K. was disconcerted to notice that he\nunderstood no more than fragments of what the Italian said. When he\nspoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was very\ninfrequent, mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be\nenjoying himself so much his head shook. When he was talking in this\nway his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which\nseemed to K. to have nothing to do with Italian but which the director\nnot only understood but also spoke, although K. ought to have foreseen\nthis as the Italian came from the south of his country where the\ndirector had also spent several years. Whatever the cause, K. realised\nthat the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely\ntaken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and his\nmoustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered\nsome help in understanding what he said. K. began to anticipate many\ndifficulties, he gave up trying to understand what the Italian\nsaid--with the director there, who could understand him so easily, it\nwould have been pointless effort--and for the time being did no more\nthan scowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in\nthe armchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored\njacket and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands\nfreely to try and depict something that K. could not grasp, even though\nhe was leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight. K.\nhad nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange\nbetween the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his\nalarm, although fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly\ngetting up, turning round and leaving. Eventually the Italian looked at\nthe clock and jumped up. After taking his leave from the director he\nturned to K., pressing himself so close to him that K. had to push his\nchair back just so that he could move. The director had, no doubt, seen\nthe anxiety in K.'s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of\nItalian, he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so\nadroit and unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor\ncomments, whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into\nwhat the Italian said so that K. could understand. K. learned in this\nway that the Italian first had a few business matters to settle, that\nhe unfortunately had only a little time at his disposal, that he\ncertainly did not intend to rush round to see every monument in the\ncity, that he would much rather--at least as long as K. would agree, it\nwas entirely his decision--just see the cathedral and to do so\nthoroughly. He was extremely pleased to be accompanied by someone who\nwas so learned and so pleasant--by this he meant K., who was occupied\nnot with listening to the Italian but the director--and asked if he\nwould be so kind, if the time was suitable, to meet him in the cathedral\nin two hours' time at about ten o'clock. He hoped he would certainly be\nable to be there at that time. K. made an appropriate reply, the Italian\nshook first the director's hand and then K.'s, then the director's again\nand went to the door, half turned to the two men who followed him and\ncontinuing to talk without a break. K. remained together with the\ndirector for a short while, although the director looked especially\nunhappy today. He thought he needed to apologise to K. for something and\ntold him--they were standing intimately close together--he had thought\nat first he would accompany the Italian himself, but then--he gave no\nmore precise reason than this--then he decided it would be better to\nsend K. with him. He should not be surprised if he could not understand\nthe Italian at first, he would be able to very soon, and even if he\nreally could not understand very much he said it was not so bad, as it\nwas really not so important for the Italian to be understood. And\nanyway, K.'s knowledge of Italian was surprisingly good, the director\nwas sure he would get by very well. And with that, it was time for K. to\ngo. He spent the time still remaining to him with a dictionary, copying\nout obscure words he would need to guide the Italian round the\ncathedral. It was an extremely irksome task, servitors brought him the\nmail, bank staff came with various queries and, when they saw that K.\nwas busy, stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to\nthem, the deputy director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and\ncame in frequently, took the dictionary from his hand and flicked\nthrough its pages, clearly for no purpose, when the door to the\nante-room opened even clients would appear from the half-darkness and\nbow timidly to him--they wanted to attract his attention but were not\nsure whether he had seen them--all this activity was circling around K.\nwith him at its centre while he compiled the list of words he would\nneed, then looked them up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then\npractised their pronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart.\nThe good intentions he had had earlier, though, seemed to have left him\ncompletely, it was the Italian who had caused him all this effort and\nsometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionary\nunder some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation, but then\nhe realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the\nItalian without saying a word, so, in an even greater rage, he pulled\nthe dictionary back out again.",

            "text": "In the distance there was a large triangle of candles flickering on the\nmain altar, K. was not certain whether he had seen them earlier.\nPerhaps they had only just been lit. Church staff creep silently as\npart of their job, you don't notice them. When K. happened to turn\nround he also saw a tall, stout candle attached to a column not far\nbehind him. It was all very pretty, but totally inadequate to illuminate\nthe pictures which were usually left in the darkness of the side\naltars, and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper. It was\ndiscourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him,\nthere would have been nothing to see, they would have had to content\nthemselves with seeking out a few pictures with K.'s electric pocket\ntorch and looking at them one small part at a time. K. went over to a\nnearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for, he went up a\nfew steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at the altar\npicture by the light of his torch. The eternal light hung disturbingly\nin front of it. The first thing that K. partly saw and partly guessed at\nwas a large knight in armour who was shown at the far edge of the\npainting. He was leaning on his sword that he had stuck into the naked\nground in front of him where only a few blades of grass grew here and\nthere. He seemed to be paying close attention to something that was\nbeing played out in front of him. It was astonishing to see how he stood\nthere without going any closer. Perhaps it was his job to stand guard.\nIt was a long time since K. had looked at any pictures and he studied\nthe knight for a long time even though he had continually to blink as\nhe found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch. Then when\nhe moved the light to the other parts of the picture he found an\ninterment of Christ shown in the usual way, it was also a comparatively\nnew painting. He put his torch away and went back to his place.\nThere seemed to be no point in waiting for the Italian any longer, but\noutside it was certainly raining heavily, and as it was not so cold in\nthe cathedral as K. had expected he decided to stay there for the time\nbeing. Close by him was the great pulpit, there were two plain golden\ncrosses attached to its little round roof which were lying almost flat\nand whose tips crossed over each other. The outside of the pulpit's\nbalustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down to the\ncolumn supporting it, little angels could be seen among the leaves,\nsome of them lively and some of them still. K. walked up to the pulpit\nand examined it from all sides, its stonework had been sculpted with\ngreat care, it seemed as if the foliage had trapped a deep darkness\nbetween and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner, K. lay his\nhand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone, until then he\nhad been totally unaware of this pulpit's existence. Then K. happened\nto notice one of the church staff standing behind the next row of pews,\nhe wore a loose, creased, black cassock, he held a snuff box in his\nleft hand and he was watching K. Now what does he want? thought K. Do I\nseem suspicious to him? Does he want a tip? But when the man in the\ncassock saw that K. had noticed him he raised his right hand, a pinch\nof snuff still held between two fingers, and pointed in some vague\ndirection. It was almost impossible to understand what this behaviour\nmeant, K. waited a while longer but the man in the cassock did not stop\ngesturing with his hand and even augmented it by nodding his head. \"Now\nwhat does he want?\" asked K. quietly, he did not dare call out loud\nhere; but then he drew out his purse and pushed his way through the\nnearest pews to reach the man. He, however, immediately gestured to\nturn down this offer, shrugged his shoulders and limped away. As a child\nK. had imitated riding on a horse with the same sort of movement as\nthis limp. \"This old man is like a child,\" thought K., \"he doesn't have\nthe sense for anything more than serving in a church. Look at the way\nhe stops when I stop, and how he waits to see whether I'll continue.\"\nWith a smile, K. followed the old man all the way up the side nave and\nalmost as far as the main altar, all this time the old man continued to\npoint at something but K. deliberately avoided looking round, he was",

            "text": "only pointing in order to make it harder for K. to follow him.\nEventually, K. did stop following, he did not want to worry the old man\ntoo much, and he also did not want to frighten him away completely in\ncase the Italian turned up after all.\nWhen he entered the central nave to go back to where he had left the\nalbum, he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next to\nthe stalls by the altar where the choir sat. It was very simple, made\nof plain white stone, and so small that from a distance it looked like\nan empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been. It\ncertainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full step\nback from the balustrade, and, although there was no decoration on it,\nthe top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man of\naverage height would not be able stand upright and would have to remain\nbent forward over the balustrade. In all, it looked as if it had been\nintended to make the priest suffer, it was impossible to understand why\nthis pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available\nwhich were large and so artistically decorated.\nAnd K. would certainly not have noticed this little pulpit if there had\nnot been a lamp fastened above it, which usually meant there was a\nsermon about to be given. So was a sermon to be given now? In this\nempty church? K. looked down at the steps which, pressed close against\nthe column, led up to the pulpit. They were so narrow they seemed to be\nthere as decoration on the column rather than for anyone to use. But\nunder the pulpit--K. grinned in astonishment--there really was a priest\nstanding with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the steps and\nlooking at K. Then he nodded very slightly, so that K. crossed himself\nand genuflected as he should have done earlier. With a little swing,\nthe priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps. Was there\nreally a sermon about to begin? Maybe the man in the cassock had not\nbeen really so demented, and had meant to lead K.'s way to the\npreacher, which in this empty church would have been very necessary.\nAnd there was also, somewhere in front of a picture of the Virgin Mary,\nan old woman who should have come to hear the sermon. And if there was\nto be a sermon why had it not been introduced on the organ? But the\norgan remained quiet and merely looked out weakly from the darkness of\nits great height.\nK. now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible, if he\ndid not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during the\nsermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted, he had\nlost so much time when he should have been in his office, there had\nlong been no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer, he looked\nat his watch, it was eleven. But could there really be a sermon given?\nCould K. constitute the entire congregation? How could he when he was\njust a stranger who wanted to look at the church? That, basically, was\nall he was. The idea of a sermon, now, at eleven o'clock, on a workday,\nin hideous weather, was nonsense. The priest--there was no doubt that\nhe was a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face--was clearly\ngoing up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by\nmistake.\nBut there had been no mistake, the priest seemed rather to check that\nthe lamp was lit and turned it a little higher, then he slowly turned\nto face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its angular\nrail with both hands. He stood there like that for a while and, without\nturning his head, looked around. K. had moved back a long way and leant\nhis elbows on the front pew. Somewhere in the church--he could not have\nsaid exactly where--he could make out the man in the cassock hunched\nunder his bent back and at peace, as if his work were completed. In the\ncathedral it was now very quiet! But K. would have to disturb that\nsilence, he had no intention of staying there; if it was the priest's\nduty to preach at a certain time regardless of the circumstances then\nhe could, and he could do it without K.'s taking part, and K.'s\npresence would do nothing to augment the effect of it. So K. began\nslowly to move, felt his way on tiptoe along the pew, arrived at the\nbroad aisle and went along it without being disturbed, except for the\nsound of his steps, however light, which rang out on the stone floor\nand resounded from the vaulting, quiet but continuous at a repeating,\nregular pace. K. felt slightly abandoned as, probably observed by the\npriest, he walked by himself between the empty pews, and the size of\nthe cathedral seemed to be just at the limit of what a man could bear.\nWhen he arrived back at where he had been sitting he did not hesitate\nbut simply reached out for the album he had left there and took it with\nhim. He had nearly left the area covered by pews and was close to the\nempty space between himself and the exit when, for the first time, he\nheard the voice of the priest. A powerful and experienced voice. It\npierced through the reaches of the cathedral ready waiting for it! But\nthe priest was not calling out to the congregation, his cry was quite\nunambiguous and there was no escape from it, he called \"Josef K.!\"\nK. stood still and looked down at the floor. In theory he was still\nfree, he could have carried on walking, through one of three dark\nlittle wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there. It\nwould simply mean he had not understood, or that he had understood but\nchose not to pay attention to it. But if he once turned round he would\nbe trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understood\nperfectly well, that he really was the Josef K. the priest had called\nto and that he was willing to follow. If the priest had called out\nagain K. would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything\nwas silent as K. also waited, he turned his head slightly as he wanted\nto see what the priest was doing now. He was merely standing in the\npulpit as before, but it was obvious that he had seen K. turn his head.\nIf K. did not now turn round completely it would have been like a child\nplaying hide and seek. He did so, and the priest beckoned him with his\nfinger. As everything could now be done openly he ran--because of\ncuriosity and the wish to get it over with--with long flying leaps\ntowards the pulpit. At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest he\nstill seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply\ndown with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit. And\nK. did as he was told, standing in that place he had to bend his head a\nlong way back just to see the priest. \"You are Josef K.,\" said the\npriest, and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whose\nmeaning was unclear. \"Yes,\" said K., he considered how freely he had\nalways given his name in the past, for some time now it had been a\nburden to him, now there were people who knew his name whom he had\nnever seen before, it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and\nonly then for people to know who you were. \"You have been accused,\"\nsaid the priest, especially gently. \"Yes,\" said K., \"so I have been\ninformed.\" \"Then you are the one I am looking for,\" said the priest. \"I\nam the prison chaplain.\" \"I see,\" said K. \"I had you summoned here,\"\nsaid the priest, \"because I wanted to speak to you.\" \"I knew nothing of\nthat,\" said K. \"I came here to show the cathedral to a gentleman from\nItaly.\" \"That is beside the point,\" said the priest. \"What are you\nholding in your hand? Is it a prayer book?\" \"No,\" answered K., \"it's an\nalbum of the city's tourist sights.\" \"Put it down,\" said the priest. K.\nthrew it away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across",

Although I do\nstill have some documents to submit.\" \"How do you imagine it will end?\"\nasked the priest. \"At first I thought it was bound to end well,\" said\nK., \"but now I have my doubts about it. I don't know how it will end. Do\nyou know?\" \"I don't,\" said the priest, \"but I fear it will end badly.\nYou are considered guilty. Your case will probably not even go beyond a\nminor court. Provisionally at least, your guilt is seen as proven.\"\n\"But I'm not guilty,\" said K., \"there's been a mistake. How is it even\npossible for someone to be guilty? We're all human beings here, one\nlike the other.\" \"That is true,\" said the priest, \"but that is how the\nguilty speak.\" \"Do you presume I'm guilty too?\" asked K. \"I make no\npresumptions about you,\" said the priest. \"I thank you for that,\" said\nK. \"but everyone else involved in these proceedings has something\nagainst me and presumes I'm guilty. They even influence those who\naren't involved. My position gets harder all the time.\" \"You don't\nunderstand the facts,\" said the priest, \"the verdict does not come\nsuddenly, proceedings continue until a verdict is reached gradually.\"\n\"I see,\" said K., lowering his head. \"What do you intend to do about\nyour case next?\" asked the priest. \"I still need to find help,\" said\nK., raising his head to see what the priest thought of this. \"There are\nstill certain possibilities I haven't yet made use of.\" \"You look for\ntoo much help from people you don't know,\" said the priest\ndisapprovingly, \"and especially from women. Can you really not see\nthat's not the help you need?\" \"Sometimes, in fact quite often, I could\nbelieve you're right,\" said K., \"but not always. Women have a lot of\npower. If I could persuade some of the women I know to work together\nwith me then I would be certain to succeed. Especially in a court like\nthis that seems to consist of nothing but woman-chasers. Show the\nexamining judge a woman in the distance and he'll run right over the\ndesk, and the accused, just to get to her as soon as he can.\" The\npriest lowered his head down to the balustrade, only now did the roof\nover the pulpit seem to press him down. What sort of dreadful weather\ncould it be outside? It was no longer just a dull day, it was deepest\nnight. None of the stained glass in the main window shed even a flicker\nof light on the darkness of the walls. And this was the moment when the\nman in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar, one\nby one. \"Are you cross with me?\" asked K. \"Maybe you don't know what\nsort of court it is you serve.\" He received no answer. \"Well, it's just\nmy own experience,\" said K. Above him there was still silence. \"I didn't\nmean to insult you,\" said K. At that, the priest screamed down at K.:\n\"Can you not see two steps in front of you?\" He shouted in anger, but it\nwas also the scream of one who sees another fall and, shocked and\nwithout thinking, screams against his own will.\nThe two men, then, remained silent for a long time. In the darkness\nbeneath him, the priest could not possibly have seen K. distinctly,\nalthough K. was able to see him clearly by the light of the little\nlamp. Why did the priest not come down? He had not given a sermon, he\nhad only told K. a few things which, if he followed them closely, would\nprobably cause him more harm than good. But the priest certainly seemed\nto mean well, it might even be possible, if he would come down and\nco-operate with him, it might even be possible for him to obtain some\nacceptable piece of advice that could make all the difference, it\nmight, for instance, be able to show him not so much to influence the\nproceedings but how to break free of them, how to evade them, how to\nlive away from them. K. had to admit that this was something he had had\non his mind quite a lot of late. If the priest knew of such a\npossibility he might, if K. asked him, let him know about it, even\nthough he was part of the court himself and even though, when K. had\ncriticised the court, he had held down his gentle nature and actually\nshouted at K.\n\"Would you not like to come down here?\" asked K. \"If you're not going\nto give a sermon come down here with me.\" \"Now I can come down,\" said\nthe priest, perhaps he regretted having shouted at K. As he took down\nthe lamp from its hook he said, \"to start off with I had to speak to\nyou from a distance. Otherwise I'm too easily influenced and forget my\nduty.\"\nK. waited for him at the foot of the steps. While he was still on one\nof the higher steps as he came down them the priest reached out his\nhand for K. to shake. \"Can you spare me a little of your time?\" asked\nK. \"As much time as you need,\" said the priest, and passed him the\nlittle lamp for him to carry. Even at close distance the priest did not\nlose a certain solemnity that seemed to be part of his character. \"You\nare very friendly towards me,\" said K., as they walked up and down\nbeside each other in the darkness of one of the side naves. \"That makes\nyou an exception among all those who belong to the court. I can trust\nyou more than any of the others I've seen. I can speak openly with you.\"\n\"Don't fool yourself,\" said the priest. \"How would I be fooling myself?\"\nasked K. \"You fool yourself in the court,\" said the priest, \"it talks\nabout this self-deceit in the opening paragraphs to the law. In front of\nthe law there is a doorkeeper. A man from the countryside comes up to\nthe door and asks for entry. But the doorkeeper says he can't let him in\nto the law right now. The man thinks about this, and then he asks if\nhe'll be able to go in later on. 'That's possible,' says the doorkeeper,\n'but not now.' The gateway to the law is open as it always is, and the\ndoorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over to try and\nsee in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and says, 'If you're\ntempted give it a try, try and go in even though I say you can't.\nCareful though: I'm powerful. And I'm only the lowliest of all the\ndoormen. But there's a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and each of\nthem is more powerful than the last. It's more than I can stand just to\nlook at the third one.' The man from the country had not expected\ndifficulties like this, the law was supposed to be accessible for\nanyone at any time, he thinks, but now he looks more closely at the\ndoorkeeper in his fur coat, sees his big hooked nose, his long thin\ntartar-beard, and he decides it's better to wait until he has\npermission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit\ndown to one side of the gate. He sits there for days and years. He tries\nto be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with his\nrequests. The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where he's\nfrom and many other things, but these are disinterested questions such\nas great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still can't\nlet him in. The man had come well equipped for his journey, and uses\neverything, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. He accepts\neverything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so that\nyou don't think there's anything you've failed to do.' Over many years,\nthe man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break. He forgets about\nthe other doormen, and begins to think this one is the only thing\nstopping him from gaining access to the law. Over the first few years he\ncurses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he becomes old, he\njust grumbles to himself. He becomes senile, and as he has come to know\neven the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over the years that he has\nbeen studying him he even asks them to help him and change the\ndoorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow dim, and he no longer knows\nwhether it's really getting darker or just his eyes that are deceiving\nhim. But he seems now to see an inextinguishable light begin to shine\nfrom the darkness behind the door. He doesn't have long to live now.\nJust before he dies, he brings together all his experience from all this\ntime into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper.\nHe beckons to him, as he's no longer able to raise his stiff body. The\ndoorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the difference in their sizes has\nchanged very much to the disadvantage of the man. 'What is it you want\nto know now?' asks the doorkeeper, 'You're insatiable.' 'Everyone wants\naccess to the law,' says the man, 'how come, over all these years,\nno-one but me has asked to be let in?' The doorkeeper can see the man's\ncome to his end, his hearing has faded, and so, so that he can be heard,\nhe shouts to him: 'Nobody else could have got in this way, as this\nentrance was meant only for you. Now I'll go and close it.'\"\n\"So the doorkeeper cheated the man,\" said K. immediately, who had been\ncaptivated by the story. \"Don't be too quick,\" said the priest, \"don't\ntake somebody else's opinion without checking it. I told you the story\nexactly as it was written. There's nothing in there about cheating.\"\n\"But it's quite clear,\" said K., \"and your first interpretation of it\nwas quite correct. The doorkeeper gave him the information that would\nrelease him only when it could be of no more use.\" \"He didn't ask him\nbefore that,\" said the priest, \"and don't forget he was only a\ndoorkeeper, and as doorkeeper he did his duty.\" \"What makes you think\nhe did his duty?\" asked K., \"He didn't. It might have been his duty to\nkeep everyone else away, but this man is who the door was intended for\nand he ought to have let him in.\" \"You're not paying enough attention\nto what was written and you're changing the story,\" said the priest.\n\"According to the story, there are two important things that the\ndoorkeeper explains about access to the law, one at the beginning, one\nat the end. At one place he says he can't allow him in now, and at the\nother he says this entrance was intended for him alone. If one of the\nstatements contradicted the other you would be right and the doorkeeper\nwould have cheated the man from the country. But there is no\ncontradiction. On the contrary, the first statement even hints at the\nsecond. You could almost say the doorkeeper went beyond his duty in\nthat he offered the man some prospect of being admitted in the future.\nThroughout the story, his duty seems to have been merely to turn the\nman away, and there are many commentators who are surprised that the\ndoorkeeper offered this hint at all, as he seems to love exactitude and\nkeeps strict guard over his position. He stays at his post for many\nyears and doesn't close the gate until the very end, he's very\nconscious of the importance of his service, as he says, 'I'm powerful,'\nhe has respect for his superiors, as he says, 'I'm only the lowliest of\nthe doormen,' he's not talkative, as through all these years the only\nquestions he asks are 'disinterested,' he's not corruptible, as when\nhe's offered a gift he says, 'I'll only accept this so that you don't\nthink there's anything you've failed to do,' as far as fulfilling his\nduty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged, as it says about the\nman that, 'he tires the doorkeeper with his requests,' even his\nexternal appearance suggests a pedantic character, the big hooked nose\nand the long, thin, black tartar-beard. How could any doorkeeper be\nmore faithful to his duty? But in the doorkeeper's character there are\nalso other features which might be very useful for those who seek entry\nto the law, and when he hinted at some possibility in the future it\nalways seemed to make it clear that he might even go beyond his duty.\nThere's no denying he's a little simple-minded, and that makes him a\nlittle conceited. Even if all he said about his power and the power of\nthe other doorkeepers and how not even he could bear the sight of\nthem--I say even if all these assertions are right, the way he makes\nthem shows that he's too simple and arrogant to understand properly.\nThe commentators say about this that, 'correct understanding of a matter\nand a misunderstanding of the same matter are not mutually exclusive.'\nWhether they're right or not, you have to concede that his simplicity\nand arrogance, however little they show, do weaken his function of\nguarding the entrance, they are defects in the doorkeeper's character.\nYou also have to consider that the doorkeeper seems to be friendly by\nnature, he isn't always just an official. He makes a joke right at the\nbeginning, in that he invites the man to enter at the same time as\nmaintaining the ban on his entering, and then he doesn't send him away\nbut gives him, as it says in the text, a stool to sit on and lets him\nstay by the side of the door. The patience with which he puts up with\nthe man's requests through all these years, the little questioning\nsessions, accepting the gifts, his politeness when he puts up with the\nman cursing his fate even though it was the doorkeeper who caused that\nfate--all these things seem to want to arouse our sympathy. Not every\ndoorkeeper would have behaved in the same way. And finally, he lets the\nman beckon him and he bends deep down to him so that he can put his\nlast question. There's no more than some slight impatience--the\ndoorkeeper knows everything's come to its end--shown in the words,\n'You're insatiable.' There are many commentators who go even further in\nexplaining it in this way and think the words, 'you're insatiable' are\nan expression of friendly admiration, albeit with some condescension.\nHowever you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes out\ndifferently from how you might think.\" \"You know the story better than\nI do and you've known it for longer,\" said K. They were silent for a\nwhile. And then K. said, \"So you think the man was not cheated, do\nyou?\" \"Don't get me wrong,\" said the priest, \"I'm just pointing out the\ndifferent opinions about it. You shouldn't pay too much attention to\npeople's opinions. The text cannot be altered, and the various opinions\nare often no more than an expression of despair over it. There's even\none opinion which says it's the doorkeeper who's been cheated.\" \"That\ndoes seem to take things too far,\" said K. \"How can they argue the\ndoorkeeper has been cheated?\" \"Their argument,\" answered the priest,\n\"is based on the simplicity of the doorkeeper. They say the doorkeeper\ndoesn't know the inside of the law, only the way into it where he just\nwalks up and down. They see his ideas of what's inside the law as\nrather childish, and suppose he's afraid himself of what he wants to\nmake the man frightened of. Yes, he's more afraid of it than the man, as\nthe man wants nothing but to go inside the law, even after he's heard\nabout the terrible doormen there, in contrast to the doorkeeper who\ndoesn't want to go in, or at least we don't hear anything about it. On\nthe other hand, there are those who say he must have already been inside\nthe law as he has been taken on into its service and that could only\nhave been done inside. That can be countered by supposing he could have\nbeen given the job of doorkeeper by somebody calling out from inside,\nand that he can't have gone very far inside as he couldn't bear the\nsight of the third doorkeeper. Nor, through all those years, does the\nstory say the doorkeeper told the man anything about the inside, other\nthan his comment about the other doorkeepers. He could have been\nforbidden to do so, but he hasn't said anything about that either. All\nthis seems to show he doesn't know anything about what the inside looks\nlike or what it means, and that that's why he's being deceived. But he's\nalso being deceived by the man from the country as he's this man's\nsubordinate and doesn't know it. There's a lot to indicate that he\ntreats the man as his subordinate, I expect you remember, but those who\nhold this view would say it's very clear that he really is his\nsubordinate. Above all, the free man is superior to the man who has to\nserve another. Now, the man really is free, he can go wherever he wants,\nthe only thing forbidden to him is entry into the law and, what's more,\nthere's only one man forbidding him to do so--the doorkeeper. If he\ntakes the stool and sits down beside the door and stays there all his\nlife he does this of his own free will, there's nothing in the story to\nsay he was forced to do it. On the other hand, the doorkeeper is kept to\nhis post by his employment, he's not allowed to go away from it and it\nseems he's not allowed to go inside either, not even if he wanted to.\nAlso, although he's in the service of the law he's only there for this\none entrance, therefore he's there only in the service of this one man\nwho the door's intended for. This is another way in which he's his\nsubordinate. We can take it that he's been performing this somewhat\nempty service for many years, through the whole of a man's life, as it\nsays that a man will come, that means someone old enough to be a man.\nThat means the doorkeeper will have to wait a long time before his\nfunction is fulfilled, he will have to wait for as long as the man\nliked, who came to the door of his own free will. Even the end of the\ndoorkeeper's service is determined by when the man's life ends, so the\ndoorkeeper remains his subordinate right to the end. And it's pointed\nout repeatedly that the doorkeeper seems to know nothing of any of\nthis, although this is not seen as anything remarkable, as those who\nhold this view see the doorkeeper as deluded in a way that's far worse,\na way that's to do with his service. At the end, speaking about the\nentrance he says, 'Now I'll go and close it,' although at the beginning\nof the story it says the door to the law is open as it always is, but if\nit's always open--always--that means it's open independently of the\nlifespan of the man it's intended for, and not even the doorkeeper will\nbe able to close it. There are various opinions about this, some say\nthe doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion to\nduty or, just when the man was in his last moments, the doorkeeper\nwanted to cause him regret and sorrow. There are many who agree that he\nwouldn't be able to close the door. They even believe, at the end at\nleast, the doorkeeper is aware, deep down, that he's the man's\nsubordinate, as the man sees the light that shines out of the entry to\nthe law whereas the doorkeeper would probably have his back to it and\nsays nothing at all to show there's been any change.\" \"That is well\nsubstantiated,\" said K., who had been repeating some parts of the\npriest's explanation to himself in a whisper. \"It is well substantiated,\nand now I too think the doorkeeper must have been deceived. Although\nthat does not mean I've abandoned what I thought earlier as the two\nversions are, to some extent, not incompatible. It's not clear whether\nthe doorkeeper sees clearly or is deceived. I said the man had been\ncheated. If the doorkeeper understands clearly, then there could be some\ndoubt about it, but if the doorkeeper has been deceived then the man is\nbound to believe the same thing. That would mean the doorkeeper is not a\ncheat but so simple-minded that he ought to be dismissed from his job\nimmediately; if the doorkeeper is mistaken it will do him no harm but\nthe man will be harmed immensely.\" \"There you've found another opinion,\"\nsaid the priest, \"as there are many who say the story doesn't give\nanyone the right to judge the doorkeeper. However he might seem to us he\nis still in the service of the law, so he belongs to the law, so he's\nbeyond what man has a right to judge. In this case we can't believe the\ndoorkeeper is the man's subordinate. Even if he has to stay at the\nentrance into the law his service makes him incomparably more than if he\nlived freely in the world. The man has come to the law for the first\ntime and the doorkeeper is already there. He's been given his position\nby the law, to doubt his worth would be to doubt the law.\" \"I can't say\nI'm in complete agreement with this view,\" said K. shaking his head, \"as\nif you accept it you'll have to accept that everything said by the\ndoorkeeper is true. But you've already explained very fully that that's\nnot possible.\" \"No,\" said the priest, \"you don't need to accept\neverything as true, you only have to accept it as necessary.\"\n\"Depressing view,\" said K. \"The lie made into the rule of the world.\"\nK. said that as if it were his final word but it was not his\nconclusion. He was too tired to think about all the ramifications of\nthe story, and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiar\nto him, unrealistic things, things better suited for officials of the\ncourt to discuss than for him. The simple story had lost its shape, he\nwanted to shake it off, and the priest who now felt quite compassionate\nallowed this and accepted K.'s remarks without comment, even though his\nview was certainly very different from K.'s.\nIn silence, they carried on walking for some time, K. stayed close\nbeside the priest without knowing where he was. The lamp in his hand\nhad long since gone out. Once, just in front of him, he thought he\ncould see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it,\nalthough it quickly disappeared back into the darkness. So that he would\nnot remain entirely dependent on the priest, K. asked him, \"We're now\nnear the main entrance, are we?\" \"No,\" said the priest, \"we're a long\nway from it. Do you already want to go?\" K. had not thought of going\nuntil then, but he immediately said, \"Yes, certainly, I have to go. I'm\nthe chief clerk in a bank and there are people waiting for me, I only\ncame here to show a foreign business contact round the cathedral.\"\n\"Alright,\" said the priest offering him his hand, \"go then.\" \"But I\ncan't find my way round in this darkness by myself,\" said K. \"Go to your\nleft as far as the wall,\" said the priest, \"then continue alongside the\nwall without leaving it and you'll find a way out.\" The priest had only\ngone a few paces from him, but K. was already shouting loudly, \"Please,\nwait!\" \"I'm waiting,\" said the priest. \"Is there anything else you want\nfrom me?\" asked K. \"No,\" said the priest. \"You were so friendly to me\nearlier on,\" said K., \"and you explained everything, but now you\nabandon me as if I were nothing to you.\" \"You have to go,\" said the",

In frock coats, pale and fat, wearing top hats\nthat looked like they could not be taken off their heads. After some\nbrief formalities at the door of the flat when they first arrived, the\nsame formalities were repeated at greater length at K.'s door. He had\nnot been notified they would be coming, but K. sat in a chair near the\ndoor, dressed in black as they were, and slowly put on new gloves which\nstretched tightly over his fingers and behaved as if he were expecting\nvisitors. He immediately stood up and looked at the gentlemen\ninquisitively. \"You've come for me then, have you?\" he asked. The\ngentlemen nodded, one of them indicated the other with the top hand now\nin his hand. K. told them he had been expecting a different visitor. He\nwent to the window and looked once more down at the dark street. Most\nof the windows on the other side of the street were also dark already,\nmany of them had the curtains closed. In one of the windows on the same\nfloor where there was a light on, two small children could be seen\nplaying with each other inside a playpen, unable to move from where\nthey were, reaching out for each other with their little hands. \"Some\nancient, unimportant actors--that's what they've sent for me,\" said K.\nto himself, and looked round once again to confirm this to himself.\n\"They want to sort me out as cheaply as they can.\" K. suddenly turned\nround to face the two men and asked, \"What theatre do you play in?\"\n\"Theatre?\" asked one of the gentlemen, turning to the other for\nassistance and pulling in the corners of his mouth. The other made a\ngesture like someone who was dumb, as if he were struggling with some\norganism causing him trouble. \"You're not properly prepared to answer\nquestions,\" said K. and went to fetch his hat.\nAs soon as they were on the stairs the gentlemen wanted to take K.'s\narms, but K. said \"Wait till we're in the street, I'm not ill.\" But\nthey waited only until the front door before they took his arms in a\nway that K. had never experienced before. They kept their shoulders\nclose behind his, did not turn their arms in but twisted them around\nthe entire length of K.'s arms and took hold of his hands with a grasp\nthat was formal, experienced and could not be resisted. K. was held\nstiff and upright between them, they formed now a single unit so that if\nany one of them had been knocked down all of them must have fallen.\nThey formed a unit of the sort that normally can be formed only by\nmatter that is lifeless.",

K. made an involuntary shiver, at which the\ngentleman gave him a gentle, reassuring tap on the back. Then he\ncarefully folded the things up as if they would still be needed, even\nif not in the near future. He did not want to expose K. to the chilly\nnight air without moving though, so he took him under the arm and\nwalked up and down with him a little way while the other gentleman\nlooked round the quarry for a suitable place. When he had found it he\nmade a sign and the other gentleman escorted him there. It was near the\nrockface, there was a stone lying there that had broken loose. The\ngentlemen sat K. down on the ground, leant him against the stone and\nsettled his head down on the top of it. Despite all the effort they\nwent to, and despite all the co-operation shown by K., his demeanour\nseemed very forced and hard to believe. So one of the gentlemen asked\nthe other to grant him a short time while he put K. in position by\nhimself, but even that did nothing to make it better. In the end they\nleft K. in a position that was far from the best of the ones they had\ntried so far. Then one of the gentlemen opened his frock coat and from a\nsheath hanging on a belt stretched across his waistcoat he withdrew a\nlong, thin, double-edged butcher's knife which he held up in the light\nto test its sharpness. The repulsive courtesies began once again, one of\nthem passed the knife over K. to the other, who then passed it back over\nK. to the first. K. now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as\nit passed from hand to hand above him and thrust it into himself. But\nhe did not do it, instead he twisted his neck, which was still free,\nand looked around. He was not able to show his full worth, was not able\nto take all the work from the official bodies, he lacked the rest of\nthe strength he needed and this final shortcoming was the fault of\nwhoever had denied it to him. As he looked round, he saw the top floor\nof the building next to the quarry. He saw how a light flickered on and\nthe two halves of a window opened out, somebody, made weak and thin by\nthe height and the distance, leant suddenly far out from it and\nstretched his arms out even further. Who was that? A friend? A good\nperson? Somebody who was taking part? Somebody who wanted to help? Was\nhe alone? Was it everyone? Would anyone help? Were there objections that\nhad been forgotten? There must have been some. The logic cannot be\nrefuted, but someone who wants to live will not resist it. Where was the\njudge he'd never seen? Where was the high court he had never reached? He\nraised both hands and spread out all his fingers.\nBut the hands of one of the gentleman were laid on K.'s throat, while\nthe other pushed the knife deep into his heart and twisted it there,\ntwice. As his eyesight failed, K. saw the two gentlemen cheek by cheek,\nclose in front of his face, watching the result. \"Like a dog!\" he said,\nit was as if the shame of it should outlive him.",
