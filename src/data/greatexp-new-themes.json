My first most vivid and broad\nimpression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on\na memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out\nfor certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the\nchurchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also\nGeorgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,\nBartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the\naforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness\nbeyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates,\nwith scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low\nleaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from\nwhich the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of\nshivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.\n\"Hold your noise!\" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from\namong the graves at the side of the church porch. \"Keep still, you\nlittle devil, or I'll cut your throat!\"\nA fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man\nwith no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his\nhead. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and\nlamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by\nbriars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose\nteeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.\n\"Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir,\" I pleaded in terror. \"Pray don't do it,\nsir.\"\n\"Tell us your name!\" said the man. \"Quick!\"\n\"Pip, sir.\"\n\"Once more,\" said the man, staring at me. \"Give it mouth!\"\n\"Pip. Pip, sir.\"\n\"Show us where you live,\" said the man. \"Pint out the place!\"\nI pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the\nalder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and\nemptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.\nWhen the church came to itself,\u2014for he was so sudden and strong that he\nmade it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my\nfeet,\u2014when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high\ntombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.\n[Illustration]\n\"You young dog,\" said the man, licking his lips, \"what fat cheeks you\nha' got.\"\nI believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my\nyears, and not strong.\n\"Darn me if I couldn't eat 'em,\" said the man, with a threatening shake\nof his head, \"and if I han't half a mind to't!\"\nI earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the\ntombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;\npartly, to keep myself from crying.\n\"Now lookee here!\" said the man. \"Where's your mother?\"\n\"There, sir!\" said I.\nHe started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\n\"There, sir!\" I timidly explained. \"Also Georgiana. That's my mother.\"\n\"Oh!\" said he, coming back. \"And is that your father alonger your\nmother?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said I; \"him too; late of this parish.\"\n\"Ha!\" he muttered then, considering. \"Who d'ye live with,\u2014supposin'\nyou're kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?\"\n\"My sister, sir,\u2014Mrs. Joe Gargery,\u2014wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,\nsir.\"\n\"Blacksmith, eh?\" said he. And looked down at his leg.\nAfter darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to\nmy tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he\ncould hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,\nand mine looked most helplessly up into his.\n\"Now lookee here,\" he said, \"the question being whether you're to be\nlet to live. You know what a file is?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"And you know what wittles is?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger.\n\"You get me a file.\" He tilted me again. \"And you get me wittles.\" He\ntilted me again. \"You bring 'em both to me.\" He tilted me again. \"Or\nI'll have your heart and liver out.\" He tilted me again.\nI was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\nhands, and said, \"If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\nsir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.\"\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\nover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\nposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:\u2014\n\"You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\nbring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and\nyou never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your\nhaving seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall\nbe let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no\nmatter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore\nout, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am.\nThere's a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I\nam a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has\na secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his\nheart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide\nhimself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in\nbed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think\nhimself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and\ncreep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young man\nfrom harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I\nfind it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what\ndo you say?\"\nI said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\nbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\nthe morning.\n\"Say Lord strike you dead if you don't!\" said the man.\nI said so, and he took me down.\n\"Now,\" he pursued, \"you remember what you've undertook, and you\nremember that young man, and you get home!\"\n\"Goo-good night, sir,\" I faltered.\n\"Much of that!\" said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. \"I\nwish I was a frog. Or a eel!\"\nAt the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his\narms,\u2014clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,\u2014and limped\ntowards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the\nnettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked\nin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,\nstretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his\nankle and pull him in.",

And she's\nout now, making it a baker's dozen.\"\n\"Is she?\"\n\"Yes, Pip,\" said Joe; \"and what's worse, she's got Tickler with her.\"\nAt this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat\nround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler\nwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled\nframe.\n\"She sot down,\" said Joe, \"and she got up, and she made a grab at\nTickler, and she Ram-paged out. That's what she did,\" said Joe, slowly\nclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at\nit; \"she Ram-paged out, Pip.\"\n\"Has she been gone long, Joe?\" I always treated him as a larger species\nof child, and as no more than my equal.\n\"Well,\" said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, \"she's been on the\nRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She's a-coming! Get\nbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.\"\nI took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,\nand finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,\nand applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by\nthrowing me\u2014I often served as a connubial missile\u2014at Joe, who, glad to\nget hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly\nfenced me up there with his great leg.",

After that, he sat feeling his\nright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with\nhis blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.\nMy sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,\nthat never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard\nand fast against her bib,\u2014where it sometimes got a pin into it, and\nsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she\ntook some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,\nin an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,\u2014using\nboth sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and\nmoulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a\nfinal smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very\nthick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the\nloaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.\nOn the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.\nI felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful\nacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew\nMrs. Joe's housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my\nlarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.\nTherefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of\nmy trousers.\nThe effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I\nfound to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap\nfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.\nAnd it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our\nalready-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his\ngood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare\nthe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each\nother's admiration now and then,\u2014which stimulated us to new exertions.\nTo-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast\ndiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he\nfound me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my\nuntouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately\nconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had\nbest be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\ncircumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at\nme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.",

At the\nbest of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a\nchoice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like\na new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded\na pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater\ncomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be\nheld in a bootjack.

            "text": "It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with\na copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with\nthe load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the\nload on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the\nbread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped\naway, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.\n\"Hark!\" said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final\nwarm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; \"was that great\nguns, Joe?\"\n\"Ah!\" said Joe. \"There's another conwict off.\"\n\"What does that mean, Joe?\" said I.\nMrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,\n\"Escaped. Escaped.\" Administering the definition like Tar-water.\nWhile Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my\nmouth into the forms of saying to Joe, \"What's a convict?\" Joe put\n_his_ mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer,\nthat I could make out nothing of it but the single word \"Pip.\"\n\"There was a conwict off last night,\" said Joe, aloud, \"after\nsunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they're\nfiring warning of another.\"\n\"_Who's_ firing?\" said I.\n\"Drat that boy,\" interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,\n\"what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you'll be told no\nlies.\"\nIt was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be\ntold lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite\nunless there was company.\nAt this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost\npains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a\nword that looked to me like \"sulks.\" Therefore, I naturally pointed to\nMrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, \"her?\" But Joe\nwouldn't hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,\nand shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make\nnothing of the word.\n\"Mrs. Joe,\" said I, as a last resort, \"I should like to know\u2014if you\nwouldn't much mind\u2014where the firing comes from?\"\n\"Lord bless the boy!\" exclaimed my sister, as if she didn't quite mean\nthat but rather the contrary. \"From the Hulks!\"\n\"Oh-h!\" said I, looking at Joe. \"Hulks!\"\nJoe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, \"Well, I told you so.\"\n\"And please, what's Hulks?\" said I.\n\"That's the way with this boy!\" exclaimed my sister, pointing me out\nwith her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. \"Answer him one\nquestion, and he'll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,\nright 'cross th' meshes.\" We always used that name for marshes, in our\ncountry.\n\"I wonder who's put into prison-ships, and why they're put there?\" said\nI, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.\nIt was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. \"I tell you what,\nyoung fellow,\" said she, \"I didn't bring you up by hand to badger\npeople's lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.\nPeople are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,\nand forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking\nquestions. Now, you get along to bed!\"\nI was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went\nupstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,\u2014from Mrs. Joe's thimble\nhaving played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,\u2014I\nfelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were\nhandy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking\nquestions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.",

Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the\nsame by their religion.\nMy sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that\nis to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a\nwell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he\nwas more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.\nNothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and\neverything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive\noccasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,\nthe picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,\nI think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young\noffender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and\ndelivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged\nmajesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being\nborn in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,\nand against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I\nwas taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make\nthem like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the\nfree use of my limbs.\nJoe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle\nfor compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to\nwhat I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.\nJoe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be\nequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\ndone. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the\nChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\nterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived\nthe idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman\nsaid, \"Ye are now to declare it!\" would be the time for me to rise and\npropose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure\nthat I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to\nthis extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.\nMr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble\nthe wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe's uncle,\nbut Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in\nthe nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was\nhalf-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and\nMrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked\n(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and\neverything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.\nThe time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and\nthe company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large",

            "text": "Joe's change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister\nwas uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally\nmore gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I\nremember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,\nwho held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married\nMr. Hubble,\u2014I don't know at what remote period,\u2014when she was much\nyounger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,\nstooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs\nextraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some\nmiles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.\nAmong this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't\nrobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and\nthe Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to\nspeak (I didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the\nscaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure\ncorners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason\nto be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have\nleft me alone. But they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think\nthe opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,\nevery now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an\nunfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched\nup by these moral goads.\nIt began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\ntheatrical declamation,\u2014as it now appears to me, something like a\nreligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,\u2014and\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\nUpon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\nreproachful voice, \"Do you hear that? Be grateful.\"\n\"Especially,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"be grateful, boy, to them which\nbrought you up by hand.\"\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\npresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, \"Why is it that the\nyoung are never grateful?\" This moral mystery seemed too much for the\ncompany until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, \"Naterally\nwicious.\" Everybody then murmured \"True!\" and looked at me in a\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.\nJoe's station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when\nthere was company than when there was none. But he always aided and\ncomforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did\nso at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being\nplenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about\nhalf a pint.\nA little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with\nsome severity, and intimated\u2014in the usual hypothetical case of the\nChurch being \"thrown open\"\u2014what kind of sermon _he_ would have given\nthem. After favouring them with some heads of that discourse, he\nremarked that he considered the subject of the day's homily, ill\nchosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many\nsubjects \"going about.\"\n\"True again,\" said Uncle Pumblechook. \"You've hit it, sir! Plenty of\nsubjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their\ntails. That's what's wanted. A man needn't go far to find a subject, if\nhe's ready with his salt-box.\" Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short\ninterval of reflection, \"Look at Pork alone. There's a subject! If you\nwant a subject, look at Pork!\"\n\"True, sir. Many a moral for the young,\" returned Mr. Wopsle,\u2014and I\nknew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; \"might be deduced\nfrom that text.\"\n(\"You listen to this,\" said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\n\"Swine,\" pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his\nfork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,\u2014\"swine\nwere the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put\nbefore us, as an example to the young.\" (I thought this pretty well in\nhim who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)\n\"What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.\"\n\"Or girl,\" suggested Mr. Hubble.\n\"Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,\" assented Mr. Wopsle, rather\nirritably, \"but there is no girl present.\"\n\"Besides,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, \"think what\nyou've got to be grateful for. If you'd been born a Squeaker\u2014\"\n\"He _was_, if ever a child was,\" said my sister, most emphatically.\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\n\"Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,\" said Mr. Pumblechook. \"If\nyou had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you\u2014\"\n\"Unless in that form,\" said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.\n\"But I don't mean in that form, sir,\" returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had\nan objection to being interrupted; \"I mean, enjoying himself with his\nelders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and\nrolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he\nwouldn't. And what would have been your destination?\" turning on me\nagain. \"You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according\nto the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would\nhave come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped\nyou under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his\nfrock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would\nhave shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then.\nNot a bit of it!\"\nJoe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.\n\"He was a world of trouble to you, ma'am,\" said Mrs. Hubble,\ncommiserating my sister.\n\"Trouble?\" echoed my sister; \"trouble?\" and then entered on a fearful\ncatalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts\nof sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled\nfrom, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I\nhad done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I\nhad contumaciously refused to go there.\nI think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with\ntheir noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in\nconsequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during\nthe recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it\nuntil he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in\ncomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the\npause was broken which ensued upon my sister's recital, and in which\npause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with\nindignation and abhorrence.",

All partook of pudding.\nThe course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the\ngenial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over\nthe day, when my sister said to Joe, \"Clean plates,\u2014cold.\"\nI clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my\nbosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my\nsoul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was\ngone.\n\"You must taste,\" said my sister, addressing the guests with her best\ngrace\u2014\"you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious\npresent of Uncle Pumblechook's!\"\nMust they! Let them not hope to taste it!\n\"You must know,\" said my sister, rising, \"it's a pie; a savory pork\npie.\"\nThe company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of\nhaving deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,\u2014quite vivaciously,\nall things considered,\u2014\"Well, Mrs. Joe, we'll do our best endeavours;\nlet us have a cut at this same pie.\"\nMy sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.\nI saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in\nthe Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that \"a bit\nof savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do\nno harm,\" and I heard Joe say, \"You shall have some, Pip.\" I have never\nbeen absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,\nmerely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that\nI could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of\nthe table, and ran for my life.\nBut I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost\ninto a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a\npair of handcuffs to me, saying, \"Here you are, look sharp, come on!\"",

They came in again without finding\nanything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate\nat the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us\nhere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\nNow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\nthought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\nhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\ncome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\nhad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\nimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\nhunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\ntreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\nIt was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe's\nback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a\nhunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and\nto keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a\npretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking\nthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.\nEither the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.\nUnder the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the\nmound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,\nthough all of a watery lead colour.\nWith my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe's broad shoulder, I\nlooked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I\ncould hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by\nhis blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\nstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\nsheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;\nand the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\nthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.",

As we came nearer to the shouting, it became\nmore and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.\nSometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.\nWhen it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate\nthan ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,\nthat we could hear one voice calling \"Murder!\" and another voice,\n\"Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!\" Then\nboth voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would\nbreak out again.

Their pieces were cocked and\nlevelled when we all ran in.\n\"Here are both men!\" panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a\nditch. \"Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come\nasunder!\"\nWater was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn,\nand blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the\nditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and\nthe other one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and\nstruggling; but of course I knew them both directly.\n\"Mind!\" said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged\nsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: \"_I_ took him! _I_\ngive him up to you! Mind that!\"\n\"It's not much to be particular about,\" said the sergeant; \"it'll do\nyou small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs\nthere!\"\n\"I don't expect it to do me any good. I don't want it to do me more\ngood than it does now,\" said my convict, with a greedy laugh. \"I took\nhim. He knows it. That's enough for me.\"\nThe other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old\nbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.\nHe could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both\nseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\nfalling.\n\"Take notice, guard,\u2014he tried to murder me,\" were his first words.\n\"Tried to murder him?\" said my convict, disdainfully. \"Try, and not do\nit? I took him, and giv' him up; that's what I done. I not only\nprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,\u2014dragged\nhim this far on his way back. He's a gentleman, if you please, this\nvillain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder\nhim? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag\nhim back!\"",

Presently we saw other torches\nkindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the\nopposite bank of the river. \"All right,\" said the sergeant. \"March.\"\nWe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. \"You are expected\non board,\" said the sergeant to my convict; \"they know you are coming.\nDon't straggle, my man. Close up here.\"\nThe two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate\nguard. I had hold of Joe's hand now, and Joe carried one of the\ntorches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to\nsee it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good\npath now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and\nthere where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy\nsluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming\nin after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon\nthe track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I\ncould see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air\nabout us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather\nto like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We\ncould not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,\nthat two or three times we had to halt while they rested.\nAfter an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut\nand a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,\nand the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was\na smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a\nstand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\novergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a\ndozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in\ntheir great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their\nheads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant\nmade some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the\nconvict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,\nto go on board first.",

By the\nlight of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from\nthe mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah's ark. Cribbed and barred and\nmoored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes\nto be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we\nsaw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches\nwere flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over\nwith him.",

Wishing to\nembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I\nshould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, \"Ah! But read the\nrest, Jo.\"\n\"The rest, eh, Pip?\" said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching\neye, \"One, two, three. Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three\nJ-O, Joes in it, Pip!\"\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the\nwhole letter.\n\"Astonishing!\" said Joe, when I had finished. \"You ARE a scholar.\"\n\"How do you spell Gargery, Joe?\" I asked him, with a modest patronage.\n\"I don't spell it at all,\" said Joe.\n\"But supposing you did?\"\n\"It _can't_ be supposed,\" said Joe. \"Tho' I'm uncommon fond of reading,\ntoo.\"\n\"Are you, Joe?\"\n\"On-common. Give me,\" said Joe, \"a good book, or a good newspaper, and\nsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!\" he\ncontinued, after rubbing his knees a little, \"when you _do_ come to a J\nand a O, and says you, 'Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,' how interesting\nreading is!\"\nI derived from this, that Joe's education, like Steam, was yet in its\ninfancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,\u2014\n\"Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\"\n\"No, Pip.\"\n\"Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\"\n\"Well, Pip,\" said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his\nusual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire\nbetween the lower bars; \"I'll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given\nto drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my\nmother, most onmerciful. It were a'most the only hammering he did,\nindeed, 'xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only to\nbe equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his\nanwil.\u2014You're a listening and understanding, Pip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\n\"Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several\ntimes; and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd say, \"Joe,\"\nshe'd say, \"now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,\" and\nshe'd put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that\nhe couldn't abear to be without us. So, he'd come with a most\ntremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where\nwe was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us\nand to give us up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us.\nWhich, you see, Pip,\" said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the\nfire, and looking at me, \"were a drawback on my learning.\"\n\"Certainly, poor Joe!\"",

Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,\nalong with all the folks.

God bless the poor little\nchild,' I said to your sister, 'there's room for _him_ at the forge!'\"\nI broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:\nwho dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, \"Ever the best of friends;\nan't us, Pip?

It must be done, as I may say, on the\nsly. And why on the sly? I'll tell you why, Pip.\"\nHe had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could\nhave proceeded in his demonstration.\n\"Your sister is given to government.\"\n\"Given to government, Joe?\" I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea\n(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a\nfavour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.\n\"Given to government,\" said Joe. \"Which I meantersay the government of\nyou and myself.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"And she an't over partial to having scholars on the premises,\" Joe\ncontinued, \"and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a\nscholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don't you\nsee?\"\nI was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as \"Why\u2014\"\nwhen Joe stopped me.\n\"Stay a bit. I know what you're a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I\ndon't deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I\ndon't deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down\nupon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page,\nPip,\" Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, \"candour\ncompels fur to admit that she is a Buster.\"\nJoe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital\nBs.\n\"Why don't I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off,\nPip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might\nfeel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that\nplacid occupation; \"your sister's a master-mind. A master-mind.\"\n\"What's that?\" I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But\nJoe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely\nstopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,\n\"Her.\"\n\"And I ain't a master-mind,\" Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,\nand got back to his whisker. \"And last of all, Pip,\u2014and this I want to\nsay very serious to you, old chap,\u2014I see so much in my poor mother, of\na woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never\ngetting no peace in her mortal days, that I'm dead afeerd of going\nwrong in the way of not doing what's right by a woman, and I'd fur\nrather of the two go wrong the t'other way, and be a little\nill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I\nwish there warn't no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it\nall on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and\nI hope you'll overlook shortcomings.\"\nYoung as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from\nthat night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,\nafterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about\nhim, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up\nto Joe in my heart.\n\"However,\" said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; \"here's the\nDutch-clock a-working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of 'em,\nand she's not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook's mare mayn't\nhave set a forefoot on a piece o' ice, and gone down.\"\nMrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,\nto assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a\nwoman's judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no\nconfidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe\nwas out on one of these expeditions.\nJoe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to\nlisten for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew\nkeenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of\nlying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars,\nand considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to\nthem as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the\nglittering multitude.\n\"Here comes the mare,\" said Joe, \"ringing like a peal of bells!\"\nThe sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as\nshe came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out,\nready for Mrs. Joe's alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might\nsee a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that\nnothing might be out of its place. When we had completed these\npreparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon\nlanded, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with\na cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air\nin with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.",

You may\nconsider that you do, but you do _not_, Joseph. For you do not know\nthat Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell,\nthis boy's fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham's, has\noffered to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to\nkeep him to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss\nHavisham's to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!\" cried my sister,\ncasting off her bonnet in sudden desperation, \"here I stand talking to\nmere Mooncalfs, with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching\ncold at the door, and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair\nof his head to the sole of his foot!\"\nWith that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face\nwas squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps\nof water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and\nthumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside\nmyself. (I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better\nacquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a\nwedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human countenance.)\nWhen my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the\nstiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was\ntrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered\nover to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the\nSheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been\ndying to make all along: \"Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but\nespecially unto them which brought you up by hand!\"\n\"Good-bye, Joe!\"\n\"God bless you, Pip, old chap!\"\nI had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what\nwith soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.

It appeared to me that he must be\na very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop;\nand I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and\nsaw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds\nand bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and\nbloom.\nIt was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this\nspeculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in\nan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the\nbedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\neyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\nbetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\nhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about the\ncorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and\nflavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I\nhardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for\nnoticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by\nlooking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact\n_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to\nget on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating\nthe baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,\nwho stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always\nporing over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and\nalways inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the\nglass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the\nHigh Street whose trade engaged his attention.\nMr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlour\nbehind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of\nbread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered\nMr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my\nsister's idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be\nimparted to my diet,\u2014besides giving me as much crumb as possible in\ncombination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm\nwater into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the\nmilk out altogether,\u2014his conversation consisted of nothing but\narithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,\npompously, \"Seven times nine, boy?\" And how should _I_ be able to\nanswer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I\nwas hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum\nthat lasted all through the breakfast. \"Seven?\" \"And four?\" \"And\neight?\" \"And six?\" \"And two?\" \"And ten?\" And so on. And after each\nfigure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a\nsup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,\nand eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)\na gorging and gormandizing manner.\nFor such reasons, I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started",

No brewing\nwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\ntime.\nA window was raised, and a clear voice demanded \"What name?\" To which\nmy conductor replied, \"Pumblechook.\" The voice returned, \"Quite right,\"\nand the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the\ncourt-yard, with keys in her hand.\n\"This,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"is Pip.\"\n\"This is Pip, is it?\" returned the young lady, who was very pretty and\nseemed very proud; \"come in, Pip.\"\nMr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.\n\"Oh!\" she said. \"Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?\"\n\"If Miss Havisham wished to see me,\" returned Mr. Pumblechook,\ndiscomfited.\n\"Ah!\" said the girl; \"but you see she don't.\"\nShe said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.\nPumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not\nprotest. But he eyed me severely,\u2014as if _I_ had done anything to\nhim!\u2014and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: \"Boy! Let\nyour behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by\nhand!\" I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to\npropound through the gate, \"And sixteen?\" But he didn't.\nMy young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.\nIt was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The\nbrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the\nwooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood\nopen, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.\nThe cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it\nmade a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the\nbrewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.\nShe saw me looking at it, and she said, \"You could drink without hurt\nall the strong beer that's brewed there now, boy.\"\n\"I should think I could, miss,\" said I, in a shy way.\n\"Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;\ndon't you think so?\"\n\"It looks like it, miss.\"\n\"Not that anybody means to try,\" she added, \"for that's all done with,\nand the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong\nbeer, there's enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor\nHouse.\"\n[Illustration]\n\"Is that the name of this house, miss?\"\n\"One of its names, boy.\"",

            "text": "\"It has more than one, then, miss?\"\n\"One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or\nHebrew, or all three\u2014or all one to me\u2014for enough.\"\n\"Enough House,\" said I; \"that's a curious name, miss.\"\n\"Yes,\" she replied; \"but it meant more than it said. It meant, when it\nwas given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They\nmust have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But\ndon't loiter, boy.\"\nThough she called me \"boy\" so often, and with a carelessness that was\nfar from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much\nolder than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and\nself-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been\none-and-twenty, and a queen.\nWe went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two\nchains across it outside,\u2014and the first thing I noticed was, that the\npassages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.\nShe took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,\nand still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.\nAt last we came to the door of a room, and she said, \"Go in.\"\nI answered, more in shyness than politeness, \"After you, miss.\"\nTo this she returned: \"Don't be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.\"\nAnd scornfully walked away, and\u2014what was worse\u2014took the candle with\nher.\nThis was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only\nthing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told\nfrom within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a\npretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of\ndaylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed\nfrom the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite\nunknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded\nlooking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady's\ndressing-table.\nWhether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\nfine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow\nresting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the\nstrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\nShe was dressed in rich materials,\u2014satins, and lace, and silks,\u2014all of\nwhite. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent\nfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was\nwhite. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and\nsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid\nthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.\nShe had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,\u2014the\nother was on the table near her hand,\u2014her veil was but half arranged,\nher watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay\nwith those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some\nflowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the\nlooking-glass.\nIt was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though\nI saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I\nsaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been\nwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw\nthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and\nlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\nsunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\nof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\nshrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly\nwaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage\nlying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\nto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\na vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to\nhave dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if\nI could.\n\"Who is it?\" said the lady at the table.\n\"Pip, ma'am.\"\n\"Pip?\"\n\"Mr. Pumblechook's boy, ma'am. Come\u2014to play.\"\n\"Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close.\"\nIt was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of\nthe surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped\nat twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at\ntwenty minutes to nine.\n\"Look at me,\" said Miss Havisham. \"You are not afraid of a woman who\nhas never seen the sun since you were born?\"\nI regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie\ncomprehended in the answer \"No.\"\n\"Do you know what I touch here?\" she said, laying her hands, one upon\nthe other, on her left side.\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" (It made me think of the young man.)\n\"What do I touch?\"\n\"Your heart.\"\n\"Broken!\"\nShe uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and\nwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept\nher hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if\nthey were heavy.\n\"I am tired,\" said Miss Havisham. \"I want diversion, and I have done\nwith men and women. Play.\"\nI think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she\ncould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the\nwide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.\n\"I sometimes have sick fancies,\" she went on, \"and I have a sick fancy\nthat I want to see some play. There, there!\" with an impatient movement\nof the fingers of her right hand; \"play, play, play!\"\nFor a moment, with the fear of my sister's working me before my eyes, I\nhad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed\ncharacter of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart. But I felt myself so\nunequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss\nHavisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as\nshe said, when we had taken a good look at each other,\u2014\n\"Are you sullen and obstinate?\"\n\"No, ma'am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can't play just\nnow. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so\nI would do it if I could; but it's so new here, and so strange, and so\nfine,\u2014and melancholy\u2014.\" I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had\nalready said it, and we took another look at each other.\nBefore she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the\ndress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in\nthe looking-glass.\n\"So new to him,\" she muttered, \"so old to me; so strange to him, so\nfamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.\"\nAs she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she\nwas still talking to herself, and kept quiet.\n\"Call Estella,\" she repeated, flashing a look at me. \"You can do that.\nCall Estella. At the door.\"\nTo stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,\nbawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor\nresponsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,\nwas almost as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and\nher light came along the dark passage like a star.\nMiss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the\ntable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\npretty brown hair. \"Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it\nwell. Let me see you play cards with this boy.\"\n\"With this boy? Why, he is a common labouring-boy!\"\nI thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,\u2014only it seemed so\nunlikely,\u2014\"Well? You can break his heart.\"\n\"What do you play, boy?\" asked Estella of myself, with the greatest\ndisdain.\n\"Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.\"\n\"Beggar him,\" said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.\nIt was then I began to understand that everything in the room had\nstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that\nMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\ntaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the\ndressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now\nyellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the\nshoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now\nyellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything,\nthis standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the\nwithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like\ngrave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.\nSo she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\ntrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew\nnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies\nburied in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being\ndistinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have\nlooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have\nstruck her to dust.",

Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice\nhad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;\naltogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,\nwithin and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.\nI played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She\nthrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she\ndespised them for having been won of me.\n\"When shall I have you here again?\" said Miss Havisham. \"Let me think.\"\nI was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she\nchecked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her\nright hand.\n\"There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of\nweeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?\"\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\"Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him\nroam and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.\"\nI followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she\nstood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the side\nentrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must\nnecessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded\nme, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange\nroom many hours.\n\"You are to wait here, you boy,\" said Estella; and disappeared and\nclosed the door.\nI took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my\ncoarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was\nnot favourable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me\nnow, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever\ntaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called\nknaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and\nthen I should have been so too.\nShe came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She\nput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and\nmeat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in\ndisgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,\u2014I\ncannot hit upon the right name for the smart\u2014God knows what its name\nwas,\u2014that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the\ngirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of\nthem. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she\ngave a contemptuous toss\u2014but with a sense, I thought, of having made\ntoo sure that I was so wounded\u2014and left me.\nBut when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face\nin, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my\nsleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.\nAs I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so\nbitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,\nthat needed counteraction.\nMy sister's bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in\nwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be\nonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is\nsmall, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many\nhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within\nmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with\ninjustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my\nsister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had\ncherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave\nher no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments,\ndisgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had\nnursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a\nsolitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was\nmorally timid and very sensitive.\nI got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\nbrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my\nface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat\nwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon\nin spirits to look about me.\nTo be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the\nbrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\nwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there\nhad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no\npigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,\nno malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper\nor the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have\nevaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a\nwilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of\nbetter days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as\na sample of the beer that was gone,\u2014and in this respect I remember\nthose recluses as being like most others.\nBehind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\nwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\nto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\nhouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\na track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes\nwalked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But\nshe seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation\npresented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking\non them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,\nand held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never\nlooked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery\nitself,\u2014by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used\nto make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I\nfirst went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the\ndoor looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and\nascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,\nas if she were going out into the sky.\nIt was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\nto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\nstranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes\u2014a little dimmed by\nlooking up at the frosty light\u2014towards a great wooden beam in a low\nnook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\nhanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one\nshoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\nMiss Havisham's, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\nshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and\nin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\nbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\nwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.\nNothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of\npeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving\ninfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have\nbrought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself\nas soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to\nlet me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I\nthought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.\nShe gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that\nmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the\ngate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,\nwhen she touched me with a taunting hand.\n\"Why don't you cry?\"\n\"Because I don't want to.\"\n\"You do,\" said she. \"You have been crying till you are half blind, and\nyou are near crying again now.\"\nShe laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.\nI went straight to Mr. Pumblechook's, and was immensely relieved to\nfind him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I\nwas wanted at Miss Havisham's again, I set off on the four-mile walk to\nour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply\nrevolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;\nthat my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of",

            "text": "When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss\nHavisham's, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself\ngetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the\nsmall of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the\nkitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient\nlength.\nIf a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other\nyoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden\nin mine,\u2014which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to\nsuspect myself of having been a monstrosity,\u2014it is the key to many\nreservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham's as\nmy eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I\nfelt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and\nalthough she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an\nimpression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my\ndragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before\nthe contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I\ncould, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.\nThe worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by\na devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came\ngaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details\ndivulged to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes\nand mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat\nheaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.\n\"Well, boy,\" Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the\nchair of honour by the fire. \"How did you get on up town?\"\nI answered, \"Pretty well, sir,\" and my sister shook her fist at me.\n\"Pretty well?\" Mr. Pumblechook repeated. \"Pretty well is no answer.\nTell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?\"\nWhitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy\nperhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my\nobstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered\nas if I had discovered a new idea, \"I mean pretty well.\"\nMy sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,\u2014I\nhad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,\u2014when Mr.\nPumblechook interposed with \"No! Don't lose your temper. Leave this lad\nto me, ma'am; leave this lad to me.\" Mr. Pumblechook then turned me\ntowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,\u2014\n\"First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?\"\nI calculated the consequences of replying \"Four Hundred Pound,\" and\nfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could\u2014which was\nsomewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my\npence-table from \"twelve pence make one shilling,\" up to \"forty pence\nmake three and fourpence,\" and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had\ndone for me, \"_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?\" To which I\nreplied, after a long interval of reflection, \"I don't know.\" And I was\nso aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.\nMr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, and\nsaid, \"Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for\ninstance?\"\n\"Yes!\" said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was\nhighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and\nbrought him to a dead stop.\n\"Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?\" Mr. Pumblechook began again when he\nhad recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\nscrew.\n\"Very tall and dark,\" I told him.\n\"Is she, uncle?\" asked my sister.\nMr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he\nhad never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.\n\"Good!\" said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (\"This is the way to have\nhim! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?\")\n\"I am sure, uncle,\" returned Mrs. Joe, \"I wish you had him always; you\nknow so well how to deal with him.\"\n\"Now, boy! What was she a-doing of, when you went in today?\" asked Mr.\nPumblechook.\n\"She was sitting,\" I answered, \"in a black velvet coach.\"\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another\u2014as they well\nmight\u2014and both repeated, \"In a black velvet coach?\"\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"And Miss Estella\u2014that's her niece, I think\u2014handed her\nin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had\ncake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat\nmine, because she told me to.\"\n\"Was anybody else there?\" asked Mr. Pumblechook.\n\"Four dogs,\" said I.\n\"Large or small?\"\n\"Immense,\" said I. \"And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver\nbasket.\"\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter\namazement. I was perfectly frantic,\u2014a reckless witness under the\ntorture,\u2014and would have told them anything.\n\"Where _was_ this coach, in the name of gracious?\" asked my sister.\n\"In Miss Havisham's room.\" They stared again. \"But there weren't any\nhorses to it.\" I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting\nfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of\nharnessing.\n\"Can this be possible, uncle?\" asked Mrs. Joe. \"What can the boy mean?\"\n\"I'll tell you, Mum,\" said Mr. Pumblechook. \"My opinion is, it's a\nsedan-chair. She's flighty, you know,\u2014very flighty,\u2014quite flighty\nenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.\"\n\"Did you ever see her in it, uncle?\" asked Mrs. Joe.\n\"How could I,\" he returned, forced to the admission, \"when I never see\nher in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!\"\n\"Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?\"\n\"Why, don't you know,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, \"that when I have\nbeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the\ndoor has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don't say you\ndon't know _that_, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did\nyou play at, boy?\"\n\"We played with flags,\" I said. (I beg to observe that I think of\nmyself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)\n\"Flags!\" echoed my sister.\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and\nMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out\nat the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.\"\n\"Swords!\" repeated my sister. \"Where did you get swords from?\"\n\"Out of a cupboard,\" said I. \"And I saw pistols in it,\u2014and jam,\u2014and\npills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up\nwith candles.\"\n\"That's true, Mum,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. \"That's the\nstate of the case, for that much I've seen myself.\" And then they both\nstared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\ncountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers\nwith my right hand.\nIf they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have\nbetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that\nthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement\nbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\nin the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the\nmarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I\nescaped. The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to\nhave a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own\nmind than for the gratification of his, related my pretended\nexperiences.\nNow, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\nkitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only\nas regarded him,\u2014not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards\nJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\ndebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham's\nacquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would \"do\nsomething\" for me; their doubts related to the form that something\nwould take. My sister stood out for \"property.\" Mr. Pumblechook was in\nfavour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel\ntrade,\u2014say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the\ndeepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I\nmight only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the\nveal-cutlets. \"If a fool's head can't express better opinions than\nthat,\" said my sister, \"and you have got any work to do, you had better\ngo and do it.\" So he went.\nAfter Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing",

Then I said, \"Before the fire goes out, Joe, I\nshould like to tell you something.\"\n\"Should you, Pip?\" said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\n\"Then tell us. What is it, Pip?\"\n\"Joe,\" said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\nit between my finger and thumb, \"you remember all that about Miss\nHavisham's?\"\n\"Remember?\" said Joe. \"I believe you! Wonderful!\"\n\"It's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true.\"\n\"What are you telling of, Pip?\" cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\namazement. \"You don't mean to say it's\u2014\"\n\"Yes I do; it's lies, Joe.\"\n\"But not all of it? Why sure you don't mean to say, Pip, that there was\nno black welwet co\u2014eh?\" For, I stood shaking my head. \"But at least\nthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,\" said Joe, persuasively, \"if there\nwarn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?\"\n\"No, Joe.\"\n\"A dog?\" said Joe. \"A puppy? Come?\"\n\"No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.\"\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\n\"Pip, old chap! This won't do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect\nto go to?\"\n\"It's terrible, Joe; ain't it?\"\n\"Terrible?\" cried Joe. \"Awful! What possessed you?\"\n\"I don't know what possessed me, Joe,\" I replied, letting his shirt\nsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\n\"but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\nwish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.\"\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been\nable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\nme, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's\nwho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that\nI knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the\nlies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.\nThis was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\nwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\nmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\n\"There's one thing you may be sure of, Pip,\" said Joe, after some\nrumination, \"namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn't\nought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\nthe same. Don't you tell no more of 'em, Pip. _That_ ain't the way to\nget out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don't make\nit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You're oncommon\nsmall. Likewise you're a oncommon scholar.\"\n\"No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.\"\n\"Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I've\nseen letters\u2014Ah! and from gentlefolks!\u2014that I'll swear weren't wrote in\nprint,\" said Joe.\n\"I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It's only\nthat.\"\n\"Well, Pip,\" said Joe, \"be it so or be it son't, you must be a common\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\nhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can't sit and write his acts of\nParliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\nPrince, with the alphabet.\u2014Ah!\" added Joe, with a shake of the head\nthat was full of meaning, \"and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\nAnd _I_ know what that is to do, though I can't say I've exactly done\nit.\"\nThere was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\nme.\n\"Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,\" pursued Joe,\nreflectively, \"mightn't be the better of continuing for to keep company\nwith common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\nones,\u2014which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?\"\n\"No, Joe.\"\n\"(I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\nmightn't be, is a thing as can't be looked into now, without putting\nyour sister on the Rampage; and that's a thing not to be thought of as\nbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a\ntrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can't get to\nbe oncommon through going straight, you'll never get to do it through\ngoing crooked. So don't tell no more on 'em, Pip, and live well and die\nhappy.\"\n\"You are not angry with me, Joe?\"\n\"No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of\na stunning and outdacious sort,\u2014alluding to them which bordered on\nweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,\u2014a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,\ntheir being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.\nThat's all, old chap, and don't never do it no more.\"",

In pursuance of this luminous\nconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's\ngreat-aunt's at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to\nget on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she\nwould impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging\nof girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her\npromise within five minutes.\nThe Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and\nput straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\ncollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\na birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,\nthe pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand\nto hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a\nlittle spelling,\u2014that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils\nthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the\nsubject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the\nhardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a\nrush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they\nhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more\nillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have\nsince met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various\nspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part\nof the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between\nBiddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave\nout the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,\u2014or\nwhat we couldn't\u2014in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,\nshrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or\nreverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had\nlasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt,\nwho staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was\nunderstood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into\nthe air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that\nthere was no prohibition against any pupil's entertaining himself with\na slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not\neasy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of\nthe little general shop in which the classes were holden\u2014and which was\nalso Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber\u2014being but\nfaintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle\nand no snuffers.",

I had received strict orders\nfrom my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that\nevening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the\nThree Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.\nThere was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk\nscores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to\nbe never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and\nhad grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our\ncountry, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it\nto account.\nIt being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at\nthese records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I\nmerely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the\nend of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and\nwhere Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a\nstranger. Joe greeted me as usual with \"Halloa, Pip, old chap!\" and the\nmoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.\nHe was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was\nall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\nmouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\nand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\nnodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\ndown there.\nBut as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\nresort, I said \"No, thank you, sir,\" and fell into the space Joe made\nfor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\nwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg\u2014in a very odd way, as\nit struck me.\n\"You was saying,\" said the strange man, turning to Joe, \"that you was a\nblacksmith.\"\n\"Yes. I said it, you know,\" said Joe.\n\"What'll you drink, Mr.\u2014? You didn't mention your name, by the bye.\"\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. \"What'll\nyou drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, \"to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of\ndrinking at anybody's expense but my own.\"\n\"Habit? No,\" returned the stranger, \"but once and away, and on a\nSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.\"\n\"I wouldn't wish to be stiff company,\" said Joe. \"Rum.\"\n\"Rum,\" repeated the stranger. \"And will the other gentleman originate a\nsentiment.\"\n\"Rum,\" said Mr. Wopsle.\n\"Three Rums!\" cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. \"Glasses\nround!\"\n\"This other gentleman,\" observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\n\"is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\nchurch.\"\n\"Aha!\" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. \"The\nlonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!\"\n\"That's it,\" said Joe.\nThe stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his\nlegs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\nbroad-brimmed traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over\nhis head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he\nlooked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\nhalf-laugh, come into his face.\n\"I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\nsolitary country towards the river.\"\n\"Most marshes is solitary,\" said Joe.\n\"No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\nvagrants of any sort, out there?\"\n\"No,\" said Joe; \"none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don't\nfind _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?\"\nMr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\nbut not warmly.\n\"Seems you have been out after such?\" asked the stranger.\n\"Once,\" returned Joe. \"Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;\nwe went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn't us,\nPip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\nThe stranger looked at me again,\u2014still cocking his eye, as if he were\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,\u2014and said, \"He's a\nlikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?\"\n\"Pip,\" said Joe.\n\"Christened Pip?\"\n\"No, not christened Pip.\"\n\"Surname Pip?\"\n\"No,\" said Joe, \"it's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\ninfant, and is called by.\"\n\"Son of yours?\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\nanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\nthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\ndiscussed over pipes,\u2014\"well\u2014no. No, he ain't.\"\n\"Nevvy?\" said the strange man.\n\"Well,\" said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, \"he\nis not\u2014no, not to deceive you, he is _not_\u2014my nevvy.\"\n\"What the Blue Blazes is he?\" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\nMr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about\nrelationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female\nrelations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and\nJoe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most\nterrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to\nthink he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, \"\u2014as\nthe poet says.\"\nAnd here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he\nconsidered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and\npoke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing\nwho visited at our house should always have put me through the same\ninflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to\nmind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our\nsocial family circle, but some large-handed person took some such\nophthalmic steps to patronise me.\nAll this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\ndown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\nshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\nIt was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\npointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at\nme, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it\nand he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with a\nfile_.\nHe did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe's\nfile, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\ninstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on\nhis settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally\nabout turnips.\nThere was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause\nbefore going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,\nwhich stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on\nSaturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water\nrunning out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.\n\"Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,\" said the strange man. \"I think I've\ngot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the\nboy shall have it.\"\nHe looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some\ncrumpled paper, and gave it to me. \"Yours!\" said he. \"Mind! Your own.\"\nI thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,\nand holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.\nWopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look\nwith his aiming eye,\u2014no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may",

This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded\nme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I\nfound when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.\nIndeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had\nany features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her\nface.\n\"Poor dear soul!\" said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my\nsister's. \"Nobody's enemy but his own!\"\n\"It would be much more commendable to be somebody else's enemy,\" said\nthe gentleman; \"far more natural.\"\n\"Cousin Raymond,\" observed another lady, \"we are to love our\nneighbour.\"\n\"Sarah Pocket,\" returned Cousin Raymond, \"if a man is not his own\nneighbour, who is?\"\nMiss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),\n\"The idea!\" But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea\ntoo. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\nemphatically, \"_Very_ true!\"\n\"Poor soul!\" Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been\nlooking at me in the mean time), \"he is so very strange! Would anyone\nbelieve that when Tom's wife died, he actually could not be induced to\nsee the importance of the children's having the deepest of trimmings to\ntheir mourning? 'Good Lord!' says he, 'Camilla, what can it signify so\nlong as the poor bereaved little things are in black?' So like Matthew!\nThe idea!\"\n\"Good points in him, good points in him,\" said Cousin Raymond; \"Heaven\nforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\nwill have, any sense of the proprieties.\"\n\"You know I was obliged,\" said Camilla,\u2014\"I was obliged to be firm. I\nsaid, 'It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.' I told him that,\nwithout deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\nbreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\nin his violent way, and said, with a D, 'Then do as you like.' Thank\nGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.\"\n\"_He_ paid for them, did he not?\" asked Estella.\n\"It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,\" returned\nCamilla. \"_I_ bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\nwhen I wake up in the night.\"\nThe ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\ncall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the\nconversation and caused Estella to say to me, \"Now, boy!\" On my turning\nround, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went\nout, I heard Sarah Pocket say, \"Well I am sure! What next!\" and Camilla",

A fire had been lately kindled in\nthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\nto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed\ncolder than the clearer air,\u2014like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry\nbranches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the\nchamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its\ndarkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but\nevery discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and\ndropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a\ntablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the\nhouse and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece\nof some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily\noverhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,\nas I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its\nseeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with\nblotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some\ncircumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in\nthe spider community.\nI heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\noccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles\ntook no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a\nponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of\nhearing, and not on terms with one another.\nThese crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\nthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\nIn her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,\nand she looked like the Witch of the place.\n\"This,\" said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, \"is where\nI will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.\"\nWith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\nthere and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork\nat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\n\"What do you think that is?\" she asked me, again pointing with her\nstick; \"that, where those cobwebs are?\"\n\"I can't guess what it is, ma'am.\"\n\"It's a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!\"\nShe looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, \"Come, come, come!\nWalk me, walk me!\"\nI made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\nHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\nshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\nbeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\nPumblechook's chaise-cart.\nShe was not physically strong, and after a little time said, \"Slower!\"\nStill, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast.

When her light\nappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\nand round the room.\nIf only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\nhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn't know\nwhat to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham\ntwitched my shoulder, and we posted on,\u2014with a shame-faced\nconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.\n\"Dear Miss Havisham,\" said Miss Sarah Pocket. \"How well you look!\"\n\"I do not,\" returned Miss Havisham. \"I am yellow skin and bone.\"\nCamilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she\nmurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, \"Poor dear\nsoul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!\"\n\"And how are _you_?\" said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to\nCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss\nHavisham wouldn't stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly\nobnoxious to Camilla.\n\"Thank you, Miss Havisham,\" she returned, \"I am as well as can be\nexpected.\"\n\"Why, what's the matter with you?\" asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\nsharpness.\n\"Nothing worth mentioning,\" replied Camilla. \"I don't wish to make a\ndisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in\nthe night than I am quite equal to.\"\n\"Then don't think of me,\" retorted Miss Havisham.\n\"Very easily said!\" remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a\nhitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. \"Raymond is a\nwitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.\nRaymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings\nand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with\nanxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,\nI should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I\nwish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night\u2014The\nidea!\" Here, a burst of tears.\nThe Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\nhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this\npoint, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, \"Camilla, my\ndear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually\nundermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than\nthe other.\"\n\"I am not aware,\" observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\nonce, \"that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\nperson, my dear.\"\nMiss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated\nold woman, with a small face that might have been made of\nwalnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers,\nsupported this position by saying, \"No, indeed, my dear. Hem!\"\n\"Thinking is easy enough,\" said the grave lady.\n\"What is easier, you know?\" assented Miss Sarah Pocket.\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\" cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\nrise from her legs to her bosom. \"It's all very true! It's a weakness\nto be so affectionate, but I can't help it. No doubt my health would be\nmuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition\nif I could. It's the cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to\nknow I possess it, when I wake up in the night.\" Here another burst of\nfeeling.\nMiss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\nround and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the\nvisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.\n\"There's Matthew!\" said Camilla. \"Never mixing with any natural ties,",

This change had a great\ninfluence in bringing Camilla's chemistry to a sudden end.\n\"Matthew will come and see me at last,\" said Miss Havisham, sternly,\n\"when I am laid on that table. That will be his place,\u2014there,\" striking\nthe table with her stick, \"at my head! And yours will be there! And\nyour husband's there! And Sarah Pocket's there! And Georgiana's there!\nNow you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast\nupon me. And now go!\"\nAt the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in\na new place. She now said, \"Walk me, walk me!\" and we went on again.\n\"I suppose there's nothing to be done,\" exclaimed Camilla, \"but comply\nand depart. It's something to have seen the object of one's love and\nduty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy\nsatisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have\nthat comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a\ndisplay of my feelings, but it's very hard to be told one wants to\nfeast on one's relations,\u2014as if one was a Giant,\u2014and to be told to go.\nThe bare idea!\"\nMr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving\nbosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I\nsupposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of\nview, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah\nPocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was\ntoo knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful\nslipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah\nPocket then made her separate effect of departing with, \"Bless you,\nMiss Havisham dear!\" and with a smile of forgiving pity on her\nwalnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.\nWhile Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked\nwith her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she\nstopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it\nsome seconds,\u2014\n\"This is my birthday, Pip.\"\nI was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.\n\"I don't suffer it to be spoken of. I don't suffer those who were here\njust now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but\nthey dare not refer to it.\"\nOf course _I_ made no further effort to refer to it.\n\"On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of\ndecay,\" stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the\ntable, but not touching it, \"was brought here. It and I have worn away\ntogether. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of\nmice have gnawed at me.\"\nShe held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking\nat the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the\nonce white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state\nto crumble under a touch.\n\"When the ruin is complete,\" said she, with a ghastly look, \"and when\nthey lay me dead, in my bride's dress on the bride's table,\u2014which shall\nbe done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,\u2014so much the\nbetter if it is done on this day!\"\nShe stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own",

            "text": "\"Halloa!\" said he, \"young fellow!\"\nHalloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be\nbest answered by itself, _I_ said, \"Halloa!\" politely omitting young\nfellow.\n\"Who let _you_ in?\" said he.\n\"Miss Estella.\"\n\"Who gave you leave to prowl about?\"\n\"Miss Estella.\"\n\"Come and fight,\" said the pale young gentleman.\nWhat could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question\nsince; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was so\nastonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a\nspell.\n\"Stop a minute, though,\" he said, wheeling round before we had gone\nmany paces. \"I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it\nis!\" In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against\none another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my\nhair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my\nstomach.\nThe bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was\nunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was\nparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit\nout at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, \"Aha! Would\nyou?\" and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite\nunparalleled within my limited experience.\n\"Laws of the game!\" said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to\nhis right. \"Regular rules!\" Here, he skipped from his right leg on to\nhis left. \"Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!\" Here,\nhe dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I\nlooked helplessly at him.\nI was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt\nmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\nhad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to\nconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I\nfollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking\nme if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he\nbegged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned\nwith a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. \"Available for\nboth,\" he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to\npulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a\nmanner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\nAlthough he did not look very healthy,\u2014having pimples on his face, and\na breaking out at his mouth,\u2014these dreadful preparations quite appalled\nme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\nthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for\nbattle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\nadvance of the rest of him as to development.\nMy heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\nminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\nas I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,\nlooking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\nfore-shortened.\nBut, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a\ngreat show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\nsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\nlooking up at me out of a black eye.\nHis spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\nstrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked\ndown; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or\ndrinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in\nseconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air\nand a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at\nlast. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I\nhit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again and\nagain, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head\nagainst the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and\nturned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;\nbut finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the\nsame time panting out, \"That means you have won.\"\nHe seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\ncontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\nso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, \"Can I help you?\"\nand he said \"No thankee,\" and I said \"Good afternoon,\" and _he_ said\n\"Same to you.\"",

Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;\nsometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite\nfamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she\nhated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we\nwere alone, \"Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said\nyes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when\nwe played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish\nof Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods\nwere so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled\nwhat to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish\nfondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like \"Break their\nhearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\"",

            "text": "There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which\nthe burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of\nrendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in\nthat relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure\nof beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the\nintroduction of Old Clem's respected name. Thus, you were to hammer\nboys round\u2014Old Clem! With a thump and a sound\u2014Old Clem! Beat it out,\nbeat it out\u2014Old Clem! With a clink for the stout\u2014Old Clem! Blow the\nfire, blow the fire\u2014Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher\u2014Old Clem!\nOne day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly\nsaying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, \"There,\nthere, there! Sing!\" I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I\npushed her over the floor. It happened so to catch her fancy that she\ntook it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.\nAfter that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,\nand Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so\nsubdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in\nthe grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.\nWhat could I become with these surroundings? How could my character\nfail to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts\nwere dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light\nfrom the misty yellow rooms?\nPerhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had\nnot previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I\nhad confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly\nfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger\nto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of\nhim. Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella\ndiscussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more\npotent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but\nBiddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to\ndo so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did\nnot know then, though I think I know now.\nMeanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost\ninsupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,\nPumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to\nthis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these\nhands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would\nhave done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of\nmind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before\nhim,\u2014as it were, to operate upon,\u2014and he would drag me up from my stool\n(usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me\nbefore the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,\n\"Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by\nhand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which\nso did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!\" And then he would\nrumple my hair the wrong way,\u2014which from my earliest remembrance, as\nalready hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any\nfellow-creature to do,\u2014and would hold me before him by the sleeve,\u2014a\nspectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.\nThen, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\nabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,\nthat I used to want\u2014quite painfully\u2014to burst into spiteful tears, fly\nat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\nevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.\nIn these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,\nwhile they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that he\nwas not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old\nenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into\nopposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out\nof his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating\nend to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to\nlead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching\nsight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, \"Come!\nthere's enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_'ve given trouble\nenough for one night, I hope!\" As if I had besought them as a favour to\nbother my life out.",

She mayn't\nhave know'd,\" added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, \"whether it\nwere Joe, or Jorge.\"\nMy sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden\narm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all\nabout it beforehand.\n\"And how much have you got?\" asked my sister, laughing. Positively\nlaughing!\n\"What would present company say to ten pound?\" demanded Joe.\n\"They'd say,\" returned my sister, curtly, \"pretty well. Not too much,\nbut pretty well.\"\n\"It's more than that, then,\" said Joe.\nThat fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he\nrubbed the arms of his chair, \"It's more than that, Mum.\"\n\"Why, you don't mean to say\u2014\" began my sister.\n\"Yes I do, Mum,\" said Pumblechook; \"but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good\nin you! Go on!\"\n\"What would present company say,\" proceeded Joe, \"to twenty pound?\"\n\"Handsome would be the word,\" returned my sister.\n\"Well, then,\" said Joe, \"It's more than twenty pound.\"\nThat abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a\npatronizing laugh, \"It's more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her\nup, Joseph!\"\n\"Then to make an end of it,\" said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to\nmy sister; \"it's five-and-twenty pound.\"\n\"It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum,\" echoed that basest of swindlers,\nPumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; \"and it's no more than\nyour merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy\nof the money!\"\nIf the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently\nawful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into\ncustody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality\nfar behind.\n\"Now you see, Joseph and wife,\" said Pumblechook, as he took me by the\narm above the elbow, \"I am one of them that always go right through\nwith what they've begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That's\n_my_ way. Bound out of hand.\"\n\"Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,\" said my sister (grasping the\nmoney), \"we're deeply beholden to you.\"\n\"Never mind me, Mum,\" returned that diabolical cornchandler. \"A\npleasure's a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we\nmust have him bound. I said I'd see to it\u2014to tell you the truth.\"\nThe Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once\nwent over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial\npresence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,\nexactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick;\nindeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken\nred-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd,\nI heard some people say, \"What's he done?\" and others, \"He's a young\n'un, too, but looks bad, don't he?\" One person of mild and benevolent\naspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent\nyoung man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and\nentitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.\nThe Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a\nchurch,\u2014and with people hanging over the pews looking on,\u2014and with\nmighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with\nfolded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading\nthe newspapers,\u2014and with some shining black portraits on the walls,\nwhich my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and\nsticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and\nattested, and I was \"bound\"; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while\nas if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little\npreliminaries disposed of.\nWhen we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been\nput into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly\ntortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were\nmerely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook's. And there my\nsister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would\nserve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue\nBoar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring\nthe Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.",

And what could I\npossibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,\u2014when I wasn't!\nHowever, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the\nmost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent\ncontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;\nand, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I\nplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\nto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks.\nMy only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they\nwouldn't let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,\nwoke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the\nevening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins's ode, and threw his bloodstained\nsword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and\nsaid, \"The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it\nwasn't the Tumblers' Arms.\" That, they were all in excellent spirits on\nthe road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and\nasserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive\nbore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by\nwanting to know all about everybody's private affairs) that _he_ was\nthe man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole\nthe weakest pilgrim going.\nFinally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly\nwretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like\nJoe's trade.

Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my\nway in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly\nentered road of apprenticeship to Joe.\nI remember that at a later period of my \"time,\" I used to stand about\nthe churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my\nown perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness\nbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both\nthere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea.

It is about the only thing I _am_ glad to\nknow of myself in that connection.\nFor, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I\nproceed to add was Joe's. It was not because I was faithful, but\nbecause Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier\nor a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of\nindustry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,\nthat I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible\nto know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing\nman flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it\nhas touched one's self in going by, and I know right well that any good\nthat intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented\nJoe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.",

What is any visit made for?\"\n\"There is some wisits p'r'aps,\" said Joe, \"as for ever remains open to\nthe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might\nthink you wanted something,\u2014expected something of her.\"\n\"Don't you think I might say that I did not, Joe?\"\n\"You might, old chap,\" said Joe. \"And she might credit it. Similarly\nshe mightn't.\"\nJoe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.\n\"You see, Pip,\" Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, \"Miss\nHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the\nhandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were\nall.\"\n\"Yes, Joe. I heard her.\"\n\"ALL,\" Joe repeated, very emphatically.\n\"Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.\"\n\"Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,\u2014Make a end\non it!\u2014As you was!\u2014Me to the North, and you to the South!\u2014Keep in\nsunders!\"\nI had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to\nfind that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more\nprobable.\n\"But, Joe.\"\n\"Yes, old chap.\"\n\"Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day\nof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after\nher, or shown that I remember her.\"\n\"That's true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\nall four round,\u2014and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four\nround might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of\nhoofs\u2014\"\n\"I don't mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don't mean a present.\"\nBut Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon\nit. \"Or even,\" said he, \"if you was helped to knocking her up a new\nchain for the front door,\u2014or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws\nfor general use,\u2014or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork\nwhen she took her muffins,\u2014or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\nlike\u2014\"\n\"I don't mean any present at all, Joe,\" I interposed.\n\"Well,\" said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly\npressed it, \"if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn't. No, I would _not_. For\nwhat's a door-chain when she's got one always up? And shark-headers is\nopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you'd go\ninto brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can't\nshow himself oncommon in a gridiron,\u2014for a gridiron IS a gridiron,\"\nsaid Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring\nto rouse me from a fixed delusion, \"and you may haim at what you like,\nbut a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your\nleave, and you can't help yourself\u2014\"\n\"My dear Joe,\" I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, \"don't\ngo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any\npresent.\"\n\"No, Pip,\" Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all\nalong; \"and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.\"\n\"Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack\njust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I\nwould go uptown and make a call on Miss Est\u2014Havisham.\"\n\"Which her name,\" said Joe, gravely, \"ain't Estavisham, Pip, unless she\nhave been rechris'ened.\"\n\"I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,\nJoe?\"\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of\nit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received\nwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for\na favour received, then this experimental trip should have no\nsuccessor.

            "text": "Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick. He\npretended that his Christian name was Dolge,\u2014a clear Impossibility,\u2014but\nhe was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to\nhave been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to\nhave imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its\nunderstanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of\ngreat strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even\nseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by\nmere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his\ndinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the\nWandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention\nof ever coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper's out on the marshes,\nand on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his\nhands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his\nneck and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the\nsluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,\nlocomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or\notherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,\nhalf-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it\nwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.\nThis morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and\ntimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner\nof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was\nnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy,\nand that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe's 'prentice,\nOrlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace\nhim; howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything,\nor did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he\nalways beat his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old\nClem, he came in out of time.\nDolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of\nmy half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just\ngot a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by\nand by he said, leaning on his hammer,\u2014\n\"Now, master! Sure you're not a-going to favour only one of us. If\nYoung Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.\" I suppose he\nwas about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an\nancient person.\n\"Why, what'll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?\" said Joe.\n\"What'll _I_ do with it! What'll _he_ do with it? I'll do as much with\nit as _him_,\" said Orlick.\n\"As to Pip, he's going up town,\" said Joe.\n\"Well then, as to Old Orlick, _he_'s a-going up town,\" retorted that\nworthy. \"Two can go up town. Tain't only one wot can go up town.\n\"Don't lose your temper,\" said Joe.\n\"Shall if I like,\" growled Orlick. \"Some and their uptowning! Now,\nmaster! Come. No favouring in this shop. Be a man!\"\nThe master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was\nin a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot\nbar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,\nwhisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,\u2014as if\nit were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,\u2014and\nfinally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and\nhe again leaned on his hammer,\u2014\n\"Now, master!\"\n\"Are you all right now?\" demanded Joe.\n\"Ah! I am all right,\" said gruff Old Orlick.\n\"Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,\" said\nJoe, \"let it be a half-holiday for all.\"",

Oh! oh! oh!\" Each of these exclamations\nwas a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of\nall the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for\nher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she\nconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself\ninto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; \"what was the\nname he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold\nme! Oh!\"\n\"Ah-h-h!\" growled the journeyman, between his teeth, \"I'd hold you, if\nyou was my wife. I'd hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.\"\n(\"I tell you, let her alone,\" said Joe.)\n\"Oh! To hear him!\" cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a\nscream together,\u2014which was her next stage. \"To hear the names he's\ngiving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my\nhusband standing by! Oh! Oh!\" Here my sister, after a fit of clappings\nand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and\nthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,\u2014which were the last stages\non her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete\nsuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.\nWhat could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical\ninterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he\nmeant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether\nhe was man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation\nadmitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence\nstraightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt\naprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in\nthat neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.\nOrlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young\ngentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come\nout of it. Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had\ndropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I\nthink), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was\nrecommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her\nhands in Joe's hair. Then came that singular calm and silence which\nsucceed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have\nalways connected with such a lull,\u2014namely, that it was Sunday, and\nsomebody was dead,\u2014I went upstairs to dress myself.\n[Illustration]\nWhen I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any\nother traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick's nostrils,\nwhich was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared\nfrom the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a\npeaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence\non Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting\nobservation that might do me good, \"On the Rampage, Pip, and off the\nRampage, Pip:\u2014such is Life!\"\nWith what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very\nserious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to\nMiss Havisham's, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed\nthe gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how I\ndebated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should\nundoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.\nMiss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.\n\"How, then? You here again?\" said Miss Pocket. \"What do you want?\"\nWhen I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah\nevidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my\nbusiness. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in,\nand presently brought the sharp message that I was to \"come up.\"\nEverything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.\n\"Well?\" said she, fixing her eyes upon me. \"I hope you want nothing?\nYou'll get nothing.\"\n\"No indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing\nvery well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.\"\n\"There, there!\" with the old restless fingers. \"Come now and then; come\non your birthday.\u2014Ay!\" she cried suddenly, turning herself and her\nchair towards me, \"You are looking round for Estella? Hey?\"\nI had been looking round,\u2014in fact, for Estella,\u2014and I stammered that I\nhoped she was well.\n\"Abroad,\" said Miss Havisham; \"educating for a lady; far out of reach;\nprettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you\nhave lost her?\"\nThere was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last\nwords, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a\nloss what to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by\ndismissing me. When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the\nwalnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my\nhome and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by\n_that_ motion.\nAs I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at\nthe shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,\nwho should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in\nhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that\nmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on\nthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner\ndid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence\nhad put a 'prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,\nand insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour. As I\nknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the\nway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better\nthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into\nPumblechook's just as the street and the shops were lighting up.\nAs I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I\ndon't know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it\ntook until half-past nine o' clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle\ngot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he\nbecame so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful\ncareer. I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being\ncut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to\nseed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was\na mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the\nidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When\nBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively\napologetic, Pumblechook's indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,\ntoo, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and\nmaudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating\ncircumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every\noccasion; it became sheer monomania in my master's daughter to care a\nbutton for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating\nconduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general\nfeebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle\nhad closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his\nhead, and saying, \"Take warning, boy, take warning!\" as if it were a\nwell-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided\nI could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.\nIt was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with\nMr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out,\nand it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of\nthe lamp's usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance\non the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose\nwith a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we\ncame upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.\n\"Halloa!\" we said, stopping. \"Orlick there?\"\n\"Ah!\" he answered, slouching out. \"I was standing by a minute, on the\nchance of company.\"\n\"You are late,\" I remarked.\nOrlick not unnaturally answered, \"Well? And _you_'re late.\"\n\"We have been,\" said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,\u2014\"we\nhave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.\"\nOld Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all\nwent on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending\nhis half-holiday up and down town?\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn't see\nyou, but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns\nis going again.\"\n\"At the Hulks?\" said I.\n\"Ay! There's some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been\ngoing since dark, about. You'll hear one presently.\"\nIn effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the\nwell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily\nrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing\nand threatening the fugitives.\n\"A good night for cutting off in,\" said Orlick. \"We'd be puzzled how to\nbring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.\"\nThe subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in\nsilence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening's\ntragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,\nwith his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very\ndark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the\nsound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled\nsulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my\nthoughts. Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game\non Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick\nsometimes growled, \"Beat it out, beat it out,\u2014Old Clem! With a clink\nfor the stout,\u2014Old Clem!\" I thought he had been drinking, but he was\nnot drunk.\nThus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us\npast the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find\u2014it being\neleven o'clock\u2014in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and\nunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered\nabout. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising that\na convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.\n\"There's something wrong,\" said he, without stopping, \"up at your\nplace, Pip. Run all!\"\n\"What is it?\" I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.\n\"I can't quite understand. The house seems to have been violently\nentered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has\nbeen attacked and hurt.\"\nWe were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no\nstop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole\nvillage was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there\nwas Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst\nof the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,\nand so I became aware of my sister,\u2014lying without sense or movement on\nthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on\nthe back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was\nturned towards the fire,\u2014destined never to be on the Rampage again,\nwhile she was the wife of Joe.",

            "text": "With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to\nbelieve that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,\nor at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under\nobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\nany one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began\nto reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all\nsides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.\nJoe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a\nquarter after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten. While he was\nthere, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had\nexchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could not\nbe more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into\ndense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been\nbefore nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found\nher struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The\nfire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle\nvery long; the candle, however, had been blown out.\nNothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond\nthe blowing out of the candle,\u2014which stood on a table between the door\nand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and\nwas struck,\u2014was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such\nas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one\nremarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with\nsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were\ndealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\nviolence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when\nJoe picked her up, was a convict's leg-iron which had been filed\nasunder.\nNow, Joe, examining this iron with a smith's eye, declared it to have\nbeen filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the\nHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe's opinion was\ncorroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the\nprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they\nclaimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been\nworn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further,\none of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his\niron.\nKnowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed\nthe iron to be my convict's iron,\u2014the iron I had seen and heard him\nfiling at, on the marshes,\u2014but my mind did not accuse him of having put\nit to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have\nbecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.\nEither Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.\nNow, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we\npicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the\nevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and\nhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against\nhim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with\neverybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if\nhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no\ndispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore\nthem. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in\nso silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could\nlook round.\nIt was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however\nundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered\nunspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I\nshould at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the\nstory. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally\nin the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The\ncontention came, after all, to this;\u2014the secret was such an old one\nnow, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not\ntear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much\nmischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me\nif he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not\nbelieve it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets\nas a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of\ncourse\u2014for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing\nis always done?\u2014and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see\nany such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of\nthe assailant.",

They took up several obviously\nwrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,\nand persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead\nof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood\nabout the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks\nthat filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had a\nmysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as\ntaking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.\nLong after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay\nvery ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects\nmultiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of\nthe realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and\nher speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as\nto be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always\nby her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate\nin speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than\nindifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,\nextraordinary complications arose between them which I was always\ncalled in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine,\nthe substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among\nthe mildest of my own mistakes.\nHowever, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A\ntremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part\nof her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three\nmonths, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then\nremain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We\nwere at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a\ncircumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle's\ngreat-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had\nfallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.\nIt may have been about a month after my sister's reappearance in the\nkitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the\nwhole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.\nAbove all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly\ncut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had\nbeen accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me\nevery now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, \"Such a fine\nfigure of a woman as she once were, Pip!\" Biddy instantly taking the\ncleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe\nbecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,\nand to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that\ndid him good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had\nall more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that\nthey had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest\nspirits they had ever encountered.",

I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,\nfrom tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the\nsign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my\nsister's ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\nqualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one\nafter another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the\nshape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and\ndisplayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook\nher head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified\nlest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.\nWhen my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this\nmysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at\nit, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked\nthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his\ninitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.\n\"Why, of course!\" cried Biddy, with an exultant face. \"Don't you see?\nIt's _him_!\"\nOrlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify\nhim by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the\nkitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his\narm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out,\nwith a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly",

I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\nlaying it down.\n\"Biddy,\" said I, \"how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\nare very clever.\"\n\"What is it that I manage? I don't know,\" returned Biddy, smiling.\nShe managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\nmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\n\"How do you manage, Biddy,\" said I, \"to learn everything that I learn,\nand always to keep up with me?\" I was beginning to be rather vain of my\nknowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\ngreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have\nno doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\n\"I might as well ask you,\" said Biddy, \"how _you_ manage?\"\n\"No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\nme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.\"\n\"I suppose I must catch it like a cough,\" said Biddy, quietly; and went\non with her sewing.\nPursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\nBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her\nrather an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was\nequally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our\ndifferent sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I\nknew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith\nas I, or better.\n\"You are one of those, Biddy,\" said I, \"who make the most of every\nchance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how\nimproved you are!\"\nBiddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. \"I was\nyour first teacher though; wasn't I?\" said she, as she sewed.",

I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been\nuntil Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of\nliving, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled\nthe hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the\nmiserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,\nwith that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and\nshouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must\nhave been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first\nuneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of\ncourse. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I\nlooked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps\nI had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too\nreserved, and should have patronised her more (though I did not use\nthat precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.\n\"Yes, Biddy,\" I observed, when I had done turning it over, \"you were my\nfirst teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being\ntogether like this, in this kitchen.\"\n\"Ah, poor thing!\" replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to\ntransfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,\nmaking her more comfortable; \"that's sadly true!\"\n\"Well!\" said I, \"we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.\nAnd I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a\nquiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.\"\nMy sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook\nthe care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out\ntogether. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed\nthe village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the\nmarshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I\nbegan to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my\nusual way. When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank,\nwith the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it\nwould have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time\nand place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.\n\"Biddy,\" said I, after binding her to secrecy, \"I want to be a\ngentleman.\"\n\"O, I wouldn't, if I was you!\" she returned. \"I don't think it would\nanswer.\"\n\"Biddy,\" said I, with some severity, \"I have particular reasons for\nwanting to be a gentleman.\"\n\"You know best, Pip; but don't you think you are happier as you are?\"\n\"Biddy,\" I exclaimed, impatiently, \"I am not at all happy as I am. I am\ndisgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to\neither, since I was bound. Don't be absurd.\"\n\"Was I absurd?\" said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; \"I am sorry\nfor that; I didn't mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be\ncomfortable.\"\n\"Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be\ncomfortable\u2014or anything but miserable\u2014there, Biddy!\u2014unless I can lead a\nvery different sort of life from the life I lead now.\"\n\"That's a pity!\" said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.",

            "text": "Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind\nof quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half\ninclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave\nutterance to her sentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I\nknew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.\n\"If I could have settled down,\" I said to Biddy, plucking up the short\ngrass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings\nout of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,\u2014\"if I could have\nsettled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was\nlittle, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe\nwould have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone\npartners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to\nkeep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a\nfine Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for\n_you_; shouldn't I, Biddy?\"\nBiddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for\nanswer, \"Yes; I am not over-particular.\" It scarcely sounded\nflattering, but I knew she meant well.\n\"Instead of that,\" said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade\nor two, \"see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable,\nand\u2014what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had\ntold me so!\"\nBiddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more\nattentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.\n\"It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,\" she\nremarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. \"Who said it?\"\nI was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I\nwas going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I\nanswered, \"The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's, and she's more\nbeautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I\nwant to be a gentleman on her account.\" Having made this lunatic\nconfession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I\nhad some thoughts of following it.\n\"Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?\"\nBiddy quietly asked me, after a pause.\n\"I don't know,\" I moodily answered.\n\"Because, if it is to spite her,\" Biddy pursued, \"I should think\u2014but\nyou know best\u2014that might be better and more independently done by\ncaring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should\nthink\u2014but you know best\u2014she was not worth gaining over.\"\nExactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was\nperfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed\nvillage lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and\nwisest of men fall every day?\n\"It may be all quite true,\" said I to Biddy, \"but I admire her\ndreadfully.\"\nIn short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good\ngrasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All\nthe while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and\nmisplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face\nright, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the\npebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.\nBiddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.\nShe put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by\nwork, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my\nhair. Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with\nmy face upon my sleeve I cried a little,\u2014exactly as I had done in the\nbrewery yard,\u2014and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used\nby somebody, or by everybody; I can't say which.\n\"I am glad of one thing,\" said Biddy, \"and that is, that you have felt\nyou could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,\nand that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it\nand always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a\npoor one, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your\nteacher at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would\nset. But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her,\nand it's of no use now.\" So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from\nthe bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, \"Shall\nwe walk a little farther, or go home?\"\n\"Biddy,\" I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving\nher a kiss, \"I shall always tell you everything.\"\n\"Till you're a gentleman,\" said Biddy.\n\"You know I never shall be, so that's always. Not that I have any\noccasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,\u2014as I\ntold you at home the other night.\"\n\"Ah!\" said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.\nAnd then repeated, with her former pleasant change, \"shall we walk a\nlittle farther, or go home?\"\nI said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the\nsummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very\nbeautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and\nwholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing\nbeggar my neighbour by candle-light in the room with the stopped\nclocks, and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good\nfor me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those\nremembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish\nwhat I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked\nmyself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were\nbeside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?\nI was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said\nto myself, \"Pip, what a fool you are!\"\nWe talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed\nright. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and\nsomebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no\npleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her\nown breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her\nmuch the better of the two?\n\"Biddy,\" said I, when we were walking homeward, \"I wish you could put\nme right.\"\n\"I wish I could!\" said Biddy.\n\"If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,\u2014you don't mind my\nspeaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?\"\n\"Oh dear, not at all!\" said Biddy. \"Don't mind me.\"\n\"If I could only get myself to do it, _that_ would be the thing for\nme.\"\n\"But you never will, you see,\" said Biddy.",

In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet\nI took it rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.\nWhen we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and\nget over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate,\nor from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant\nway), Old Orlick.\n\"Halloa!\" he growled, \"where are you two going?\"\n\"Where should we be going, but home?\"\n\"Well, then,\" said he, \"I'm jiggered if I don't see you home!\"\nThis penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of\nhis. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,\nbut used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,\nand convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger,\nI had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he\nwould have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\nBiddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\n\"Don't let him come; I don't like him.\" As I did not like him either, I\ntook the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn't want\nseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\nlaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\ndistance.\nCurious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give\nany account, I asked her why she did not like him.\n\"Oh!\" she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\n\"because I\u2014I am afraid he likes me.\"\n\"Did he ever tell you he liked you?\" I asked indignantly.\n\"No,\" said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, \"he never told me\nso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.\"\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon\nOld Orlick's daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on\nmyself.\n\"But it makes no difference to you, you know,\" said Biddy, calmly.\n\"No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don't like it; I don't\napprove of it.\"\n\"Nor I neither,\" said Biddy. \"Though _that_ makes no difference to\nyou.\"\n\"Exactly,\" said I; \"but I must tell you I should have no opinion of\nyou, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.\"\nI kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances\nwere favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that\ndemonstration. He had struck root in Joe's establishment, by reason of\nmy sister's sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\ndismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as\nI had reason to know thereafter.\nAnd now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated",

Do you know, or do you not know, that\nthe law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is\nproved\u2014proved\u2014to be guilty?\"\n\"Sir,\" Mr. Wopsle began to reply, \"as an Englishman myself, I\u2014\"\n\"Come!\" said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. \"Don't evade\nthe question.

Which is it to\nbe?\"\nHe stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a\nbullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.\nWopsle,\u2014as it were to mark him out\u2014before biting it again.\n\"Now!\" said he. \"Do you know it, or don't you know it?\"\n\"Certainly I know it,\" replied Mr. Wopsle.\n\"Certainly you know it.

Yes, or no?\"\nMr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor\nopinion of him.\n\"Come!\" said the stranger, \"I'll help you. You don't deserve help, but\nI'll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?\"\n\"What is it?\" repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.\n\"Is it,\" pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious\nmanner, \"the printed paper you have just been reading from?\"\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\"Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal\nadvisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?\"\n\"I read that just now,\" Mr. Wopsle pleaded.\n\"Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don't ask you what you read\njust now. You may read the Lord's Prayer backwards, if you like,\u2014and,\nperhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my\nfriend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to the\nbottom, to the bottom.\" (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of\nsubterfuge.) \"Well? Have you found it?\"\n\"Here it is,\" said Mr. Wopsle.\n\"Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was\ninstructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come!\nDo you make that of it?\"\nMr. Wopsle answered, \"Those are not the exact words.\"\n\"Not the exact words!\" repeated the gentleman bitterly. \"Is that the\nexact substance?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Wopsle.\n\"Yes,\" repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company\nwith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. \"And now I\nask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that\npassage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having\npronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?\"\nWe all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought\nhim, and that he was beginning to be found out.\n\"And that same man, remember,\" pursued the gentleman, throwing his\nfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,\u2014\"that same man might be summoned as a\njuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed\nhimself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon\nhis pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly\ntry the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the\nprisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the\nevidence, so help him God!\"\nWe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too\nfar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet\ntime.\nThe strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and\nwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\nus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to",

As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion\nas an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front\ndoor. Our conference was held in the state parlour, which was feebly\nlighted by one candle.\nIt began with the strange gentleman's sitting down at the table,\ndrawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his\npocket-book. He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little\naside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to\nascertain which was which.\n\"My name,\" he said, \"is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am\npretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I\ncommence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice\nhad been asked, I should not have been here.

You would not object to cancel his\nindentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for\nso doing?\"\n\"Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's\nway,\" said Joe, staring.\n\"Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,\" returned Mr.\nJaggers. \"The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\nanything?\"\n\"The answer is,\" returned Joe, sternly, \"No.\"\nI thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool\nfor his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between\nbreathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"Recollect the admission you have made,\nand don't try to go from it presently.\"\n\"Who's a-going to try?\" retorted Joe.\n\"I don't say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?\"\n\"Yes, I do keep a dog.\"\n\"Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\nBear that in mind, will you?\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\nand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\n\"Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got\nto make is, that he has great expectations.\"\nJoe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\n\"I am instructed to communicate to him,\" said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\nfinger at me sideways, \"that he will come into a handsome property.\nFurther, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\nproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of\nlife and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,\u2014in a word,\nas a young fellow of great expectations.\"\nMy dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss\nHavisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.\n\"Now, Mr. Pip,\" pursued the lawyer, \"I address the rest of what I have\nto say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request of\nthe person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the\nname of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great\nexpectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have\nany objection, this is the time to mention it.\"\nMy heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,\nthat I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.\n\"I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that\nthe name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a\nprofound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered\nto mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first\nhand by word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be\ncarried out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now,\nyou are distinctly to understand that you are most positively\nprohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or\nreference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as _the_\nindividual, in all the communications you may have with me. If you have\na suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.\nIt is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition\nare; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere\nwhim. This is not for you to inquire into. The condition is laid down.\nYour acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the\nonly remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from\nwhom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise\nresponsible. That person is the person from whom you derive your\nexpectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.\nAgain, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a",

Understand that!\"\nHe was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\non, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\nSomething came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he\nwas going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired\ncarriage.\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.\"\n\"Halloa!\" said he, facing round, \"what's the matter?\"\n\"I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;\nso I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my\ntaking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?\"\n\"No,\" said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\n\"I don't mean in the village only, but up town?\"\n\"No,\" said he. \"No objection.\"\nI thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had\nalready locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and was\nseated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at\nthe burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the\ncoals, and nothing was said for a long time.\nMy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at\nher needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next\nJoe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the\nglowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the\nlonger the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\nAt length I got out, \"Joe, have you told Biddy?\"\n\"No, Pip,\" returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\nknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to\nmake off somewhere, \"which I left it to yourself, Pip.\"\n\"I would rather you told, Joe.\"\n\"Pip's a gentleman of fortun' then,\" said Joe, \"and God bless him in\nit!\"\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\nat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\ncongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\ncongratulations that I rather resented.\nI took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with\nthe grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and\nsay nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in\ngood time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,\nsave that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.\nBiddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work\nagain, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining\nhis knees, said, \"Ay, ay, I'll be ekervally partickler, Pip;\" and then\nthey congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at\nthe notion of my being a gentleman that I didn't half like it.\nInfinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some\nidea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts\nentirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,\nand even repeated after Biddy, the words \"Pip\" and \"Property.\" But I\ndoubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I\ncannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.\nI never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy\nbecame more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.\nDissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is\npossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied\nwith myself.\nAnyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,\nlooking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and\nabout what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I\ncaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\noften looked at me,\u2014particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\nwere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\nby word or sign.\nAt those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\ndoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings\nto air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am\nafraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the\nrustic objects among which I had passed my life.\n\"Saturday night,\" said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\nand beer. \"Five more days, and then the day before _the_ day! They'll\nsoon go.\"\n\"Yes, Pip,\" observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\n\"They'll soon go.\"\n\"Soon, soon go,\" said Biddy.\n\"I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\norder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put\nthem on there, or that I'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook's. It\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.\"\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\ntoo, Pip,\" said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese\non it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. \"So might\nWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.\"\n\"That's just what I don't want, Joe. They would make such a business of\nit,\u2014such a coarse and common business,\u2014that I couldn't bear myself.\"",

You will show yourself to us; won't you?\"\n\"Biddy,\" I returned with some resentment, \"you are so exceedingly quick\nthat it's difficult to keep up with you.\"\n(\"She always were quick,\" observed Joe.)\n\"If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\nthat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,\u2014most likely\non the evening before I go away.\"\nBiddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\naffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I\ngot into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a\nmean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,\nfor ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even\nat the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\nbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\nso often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.\nThe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\nthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I\nsaw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or\ntwo in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and\nlight it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me\nthat he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.\nHe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his\npipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew\nthat they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing\ntone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for\nmore, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and\nsat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and\nstrange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the\nloneliest I had ever known.\nLooking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe's pipe\nfloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,\u2014not\nobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\ntogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\nbed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.",

What lay\nheaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened\nbetween me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a\nmisgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and\nthat, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or\nclean gone.\nJoe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our\napproaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After\nbreakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best\nparlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With\nall the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe,\nand thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn't have read that about the\nrich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.\nAfter our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off\nthe marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I\nfelt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion\nfor the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after\nSunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the\nlow green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them\none of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner\nof roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of\ncondescension, upon everybody in the village.\nIf I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my\ncompanionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among\nthose graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place\nrecalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and\nbadge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he\nhad doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to\nme, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.\nNo more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these\ngrazing cattle,\u2014though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a\nmore respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might\nstare as long as possible at the possessor of such great\nexpectations,\u2014farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,\nhenceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith's work in\ngeneral, and for you!

He was a\nprosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous\nlittle garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let\ninto the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that\nheaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.\n\"Mr. Trabb,\" said I, \"it's an unpleasant thing to have to mention,\nbecause it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome\nproperty.\"\nA change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up\nfrom the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming,\n\"Lord bless my soul!\"\n\"I am going up to my guardian in London,\" said I, casually drawing some\nguineas out of my pocket and looking at them; \"and I want a fashionable\nsuit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,\" I added\u2014otherwise I\nthought he might only pretend to make them, \"with ready money.\"\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened\nhis arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each\nelbow, \"don't hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate\nyou? Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?\"\nMr. Trabb's boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.\nWhen I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his\nlabours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into\nthe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible\ncorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with\nany blacksmith, alive or dead.\n\"Hold that noise,\" said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, \"or\nI'll knock your head off!\u2014Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,\nthis,\" said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out\nin a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand\nunder it to show the gloss, \"is a very sweet article. I can recommend\nit for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you\nshall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!\" (To the boy, and with\na dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant's\nbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)\nMr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\ndeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.\nThen he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. \"And let\nme have none of your tricks here,\" said Mr. Trabb, \"or you shall repent\nit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.\"\nMr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential\nconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an\narticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it\nwould ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished\nfellow-townsman's (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having\nworn. \"Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,\" said Mr.\nTrabb to the boy after that, \"or shall I kick you out of the shop and\nbring them myself?\"\nI selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb's\njudgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.\nTrabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented\nwith it, he said apologetically that it \"wouldn't do under existing\ncircumstances, sir,\u2014wouldn't do at all.\" So, Mr. Trabb measured and\ncalculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest\nspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I\nfelt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\npains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\nto Mr. Pumblechook's on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand\nupon the parlour lock, \"I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be\nexpected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a\nturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem\nit. Good-morning, sir, much obliged.\u2014Door!\"\nThe last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what\nit meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\nhands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\nwas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb's boy.",

Joseph!!!\" Thereupon\nhe shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in\nJoseph.\n\"But my dear young friend,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"you must be hungry,\nyou must be exhausted.

I did the same; and if I had turned\nmyself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more\ndirect to my head.\nMr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of\ntongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and\ntook, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. \"Ah! poultry,\npoultry!

You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this\nhumble roof for one as\u2014Call it a weakness, if you will,\" said Mr.\nPumblechook, getting up again, \"but may I? _may_ I\u2014?\"\nIt began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so he\ndid it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself\nwith my knife, I don't know.\n\"And your sister,\" he resumed, after a little steady eating, \"which had\nthe honour of bringing you up by hand! It's a sad picter, to reflect\nthat she's no longer equal to fully understanding the honour. May\u2014\"\nI saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.\n\"We'll drink her health,\" said I.\n\"Ah!\" cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid\nwith admiration, \"that's the way you know 'em, sir!\" (I don't know who\nSir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person\npresent); \"that's the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever\nforgiving and ever affable. It might,\" said the servile Pumblechook,\nputting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, \"to a\ncommon person, have the appearance of repeating\u2014but _may_ I\u2014?\"\nWhen he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. \"Let\nus never be blind,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"to her faults of temper, but\nit is to be hoped she meant well.\"\nAt about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in\nthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.\nI mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes\nsent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him.

As the six evenings had dwindled\naway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more\nappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I\ndressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my\nsplendour\t until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,\ngraced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish\nwith. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in\nspirits.\nI was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little\nhand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all\nalone. I am afraid\u2014sore afraid\u2014that this purpose originated in my sense\nof the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the\ncoach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of\nthis taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on\nthis last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had\nan impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in\nthe morning. I did not.\nAll night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places\ninstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now\npigs, now men,\u2014never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me\nuntil the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and\npartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in\ntaking it fell asleep.\nBiddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not\nsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\nI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the\nafternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking\nof the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go\ndownstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and\nunstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,\nuntil Biddy called to me that I was late.\nIt was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,\nsaying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,\n\"Well! I suppose I must be off!\" and then I kissed my sister who was\nlaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,\nand threw my arms around Joe's neck. Then I took up my little\nportmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I\npresently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing\nan old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped\nthen, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above\nhis head, crying huskily \"Hooroar!\" and Biddy put her apron to her\nface.\nI walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had\nsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to\nhave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High\nStreet. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very\npeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to\nshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all\nbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave\nand sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the\nvillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, \"Good-bye, O my dear,\ndear friend!\"\nHeaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain\nupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was\nbetter after I had cried than before,\u2014more sorry, more aware of my own\ningratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe\nwith me then.\nSo subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the\ncourse of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was\nclear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would\nnot get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another\nevening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made\nup my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite\npracticable to get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while\nI was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact\nresemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my\nheart would beat high.\u2014As if he could possibly be there!\nWe changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to\ngo back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and\nthe world lay spread before me.\nThis is the end of the first stage of Pip's expectations.",

And stop\nwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open\ndoor, whereon was painted MR.

            "text": "found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour\nof Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became\naware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as\nI. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew\nClose, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the\npavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when\nthey first passed me, that \"Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.\"\nThere was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and\none of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted\nher by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, \"Jaggers\nis for him, 'Melia, and what more _could_ you have?\" There was a\nred-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering\nthere, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;\nand while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a\nhighly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a\nlamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the\nwords, \"O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,\ngive me Jaggerth!\" These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian\nmade a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than\never.\nAt length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close\ninto Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards\nme. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there\nwas quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and\nwalking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed\nhimself to his followers.\nFirst, he took the two secret men.\n\"Now, I have nothing to say to _you_,\" said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\nfinger at them. \"I want to know no more than I know. As to the result,\nit's a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you\npaid Wemmick?\"\n\"We made the money up this morning, sir,\" said one of the men,\nsubmissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers's face.\n\"I don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it\nup at all. Has Wemmick got it?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said both the men together.\n\"Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!\" said Mr Jaggers,\nwaving his hand at them to put them behind him. \"If you say a word to\nme, I'll throw up the case.\"\n\"We thought, Mr. Jaggers\u2014\" one of the men began, pulling off his hat.\n\"That's what I told you not to do,\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"_You_ thought! I\nthink for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to\nfind you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't\nhear a word.\"\nThe two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind\nagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.\n\"And now _you_!\" said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on\nthe two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly\nseparated,\u2014\"Oh! Amelia, is it?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Jaggers.\"\n\"And do you remember,\" retorted Mr. Jaggers, \"that but for me you\nwouldn't be here and couldn't be here?\"\n\"O yes, sir!\" exclaimed both women together. \"Lord bless you, sir, well\nwe knows that!\"\n\"Then why,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"do you come here?\"\n\"My Bill, sir!\" the crying woman pleaded.\n\"Now, I tell you what!\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"Once for all. If you don't\nknow that your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you come here\nbothering about your Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and\nyou, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?\"\n\"O yes, sir! Every farden.\"\n\"Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another\nword\u2014one single word\u2014and Wemmick shall give you your money back.\"\nThis terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No\none remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the\nskirts of Mr. Jaggers's coat to his lips several times.\n\"I don't know this man!\" said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating\nstrain: \"What does this fellow want?\"\n\"Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?\"\n\"Who's he?\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"Let go of my coat.\"\nThe suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing\nit, replied, \"Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.\"\n\"You're too late,\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"I am over the way.\"\n\"Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!\" cried my excitable acquaintance,\nturning white, \"don't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!\"\n\"I am,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"and there's an end of it. Get out of the\nway.\"\n\"Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen'th gone to Mithter\nWemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter\nJaggerth!

This guileless confectioner was\nnot by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of\nrecovery, which was painted over.\n\"Tell him to take his witness away directly,\" said my guardian to the\nclerk, in extreme disgust, \"and ask him what he means by bringing such\na fellow as that.\"",

There were some\nmarks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been\nsofter and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.\nThe chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment\nover his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them\noff. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his\nlinen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for\nhe wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a\nlady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,\nthat several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were\nquite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering\neyes,\u2014small, keen, and black,\u2014and thin wide mottled lips. He had had\nthem, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.\n\"So you were never in London before?\" said Mr. Wemmick to me.\n\"No,\" said I.\n\"_I_ was new here once,\" said Mr. Wemmick. \"Rum to think of now!\"\n\"You are well acquainted with it now?\"\n\"Why, yes,\" said Mr. Wemmick. \"I know the moves of it.\"\n\"Is it a very wicked place?\" I asked, more for the sake of saying\nsomething than for information.\n\"You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\nplenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.\"\n\"If there is bad blood between you and them,\" said I, to soften it off\na little.\n\"O! I don't know about bad blood,\" returned Mr. Wemmick; \"there's not\nmuch bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by\nit.\"\n\"That makes it worse.\"\n\"You think so?\" returned Mr. Wemmick. \"Much about the same, I should\nsay.\"\nHe wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before\nhim: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the\nstreets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a\nmouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the\ntop of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical\nappearance, and that he was not smiling at all.\n\"Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?\" I asked Mr. Wemmick.",

My depression was not\nalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\nto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\nwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a\ndisembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection\nof shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club\nfor Tom-cats.\nWe entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\nlike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\nit, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the\nmost dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever\nseen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those\nhouses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and\ncurtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable\nmakeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,\nas if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of\nBarnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the\npresent occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy\nmourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,\nand it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and\nhumiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry\nrot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and\ncellar,\u2014rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand\nbesides\u2014addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,\n\"Try Barnard's Mixture.\"\nSo imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great\nexpectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. \"Ah!\" said he,\nmistaking me; \"the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does\nme.\"\nHe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,\u2014which\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\nthemselves without the means of coming down,\u2014to a set of chambers on\nthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\na label on the letter-box, \"Return shortly.\"\n\"He hardly thought you'd come so soon,\" Mr. Wemmick explained. \"You\ndon't want me any more?\"\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\n\"As I keep the cash,\" Mr. Wemmick observed, \"we shall most likely meet\npretty often.

Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\nhimself,\u2014\n\"To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?\"\nI was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\nbut said yes.\n\"I have got so out of it!\" said Mr. Wemmick,\u2014\"except at last. Very\nglad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!\"\nWhen we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window\nand had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it\ncame down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not\nput my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view\nof the Inn through the window's encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully\nlooking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.\nMr. Pocket, Junior's, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly\nmaddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my\nname with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the\nwindow, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose\nbefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\nmember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\nbreath.\n\"Mr. Pip?\" said he.\n\"Mr. Pocket?\" said I.\n\"Dear me!\" he exclaimed. \"I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\ncoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\ncome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,\u2014not\nthat that is any excuse,\u2014for I thought, coming from the country, you\nmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\nMarket to get it good.\"\nFor a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\nhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think\nthis was a dream.\n\"Dear me!\" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \"This door sticks so!\"\nAs he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\nthe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\nthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\nthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\nthat he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\ndoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start\nout of my head, and as if this must be a dream.\n\"Pray come in,\" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \"Allow me to lead the way. I\nam rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably\nwell till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably\nthrough to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk\nabout London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As\nto our table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied\nfrom our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your\nexpense, such being Mr. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's\nnot by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my\nfather hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take\nit, if he had. This is our sitting-room,\u2014just such chairs and tables\nand carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You\nmustn't give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,\nbecause they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little\nbedroom; rather musty, but Barnard's _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;\nthe furniture's hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the\npurpose; if you should want anything, I'll go and fetch it. The\nchambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan't\nfight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the\nfruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite\nashamed.\"\nAs I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,\nOne, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I\nknew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,\u2014\n\"Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!\"\n\"And you,\" said I, \"are the pale young gentleman!\"",

And then we\ncontemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. \"Well!\" said the\npale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humouredly, \"it's all\nover now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you'll forgive\nme for having knocked you about so.\"\nI derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the\npale young gentleman's name) still rather confounded his intention with\nhis execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.\n\"You hadn't come into your good fortune at that time?\" said Herbert\nPocket.\n\"No,\" said I.\n\"No,\" he acquiesced: \"I heard it had happened very lately. _I_ was\nrather on the lookout for good fortune then.\"\n\"Indeed?\"\n\"Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy\nto me. But she couldn't,\u2014at all events, she didn't.\"\nI thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.\n\"Bad taste,\" said Herbert, laughing, \"but a fact. Yes, she had sent for\nme on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I\nsuppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been\nwhat-you-may-called it to Estella.\"\n\"What's that?\" I asked, with sudden gravity.\nHe was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his\nattention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.\n\"Affianced,\" he explained, still busy with the fruit. \"Betrothed.\nEngaged. What's-his-named. Any word of that sort.\"\n\"How did you bear your disappointment?\" I asked.\n\"Pooh!\" said he, \"I didn't care much for it. _She's_ a Tartar.\"\n\"Miss Havisham?\"\n\"I don't say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl's hard and\nhaughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by\nMiss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.\"\n\"What relation is she to Miss Havisham?\"\n\"None,\" said he. \"Only adopted.\"\n\"Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?\"\n\"Lord, Mr. Pip!\" said he. \"Don't you know?\"\n\"No,\" said I.\n\"Dear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And\nnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come\nthere, that day?\"\nI told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst\nout laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn't ask\nhim if _he_ was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly\nestablished.\n\"Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?\" he went on.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"You know he is Miss Havisham's man of business and solicitor, and has\nher confidence when nobody else has?\"\nThis was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with\na constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers\nin Miss Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at\nany other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having\never seen me there.\n\"He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he\ncalled on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father\nfrom his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham's\ncousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he\nis a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.\"\nHerbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who\nmore strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural\nincapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something\nwonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the\nsame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I\ndon't know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first\noccasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what\nmeans.\nHe was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered\nlanguor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did\nnot seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face,\nbut it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.\nHis figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had\ntaken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be\nlight and young. Whether Mr. Trabb's local work would have sat more\ngracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious\nthat he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried\noff my new suit.\nAs he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a\nbad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,\nand laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.\nI further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a\ncountry place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would\ntake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever\nhe saw me at a loss or going wrong.\n\"With pleasure,\" said he, \"though I venture to prophesy that you'll\nwant very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I\nshould like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me\nthe favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?\"\nI thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my\nChristian name was Philip.\n\"I don't take to Philip,\" said he, smiling, \"for it sounds like a moral\nboy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,\nor so fat that he couldn't see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that\nhe locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a\nbird's-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in\nthe neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious,\nand you have been a blacksmith,\u2014would you mind it?\"\n\"I shouldn't mind anything that you propose,\" I answered, \"but I don't\nunderstand you.\"\n\"Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of\nmusic by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.\"\n\"I should like it very much.\"\n\"Then, my dear Handel,\" said he, turning round as the door opened,\n\"here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the\ntable, because the dinner is of your providing.\"\nThis I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a\nnice little dinner,\u2014seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,\u2014and it\nacquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent\ncircumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.",

All this made\nthe feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my\npleasure was without alloy.\nWe had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his\npromise to tell me about Miss Havisham.\n\"True,\" he replied. \"I'll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the\ntopic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put\nthe knife in the mouth,\u2014for fear of accidents,\u2014and that while the fork\nis reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It\nis scarcely worth mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people\ndo. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This\nhas two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is\nthe object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening\noysters, on the part of the right elbow.\"\nHe offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we\nboth laughed and I scarcely blushed.\n\"Now,\" he pursued, \"concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must\nknow, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her\nfather denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in\nyour part of the world, and was a brewer. I don't know why it should be\na crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you\ncannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was\nand brew. You see it every day.\"\n\"Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?\" said I.\n\"Not on any account,\" returned Herbert; \"but a public-house may keep a\ngentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his\ndaughter.\"\n\"Miss Havisham was an only child?\" I hazarded.\n\"Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she\nhad a half-brother. Her father privately married again\u2014his cook, I\nrather think.\"\n\"I thought he was proud,\" said I.\n\"My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,\nbecause he was proud, and in course of time _she_ died. When she was\ndead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then\nthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are\nacquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,\nextravagant, undutiful,\u2014altogether bad. At last his father disinherited\nhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though\nnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.\u2014Take another glass of wine,\nand excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to\nbe so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it\nbottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.\"\nI had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I\nthanked him, and apologised. He said, \"Not at all,\" and resumed.\n\"Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after\nas a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what\nwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.\nThere were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\nbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a\ndeep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father's\nanger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,\u2014merely breaking off,\nmy dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a\ntumbler.\"\nWhy I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to\nsay. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a\nmuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\nwithin those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he\nsaid in the cheerfullest manner, \"Not at all, I am sure!\" and resumed.\n\"There appeared upon the scene\u2014say at the races, or the public balls,\nor anywhere else you like\u2014a certain man, who made love to Miss\nHavisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,\nbefore you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that\nhe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he\nwas not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a\ngentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a\nprinciple of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever\nwas, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no\nvarnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you\nput on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued\nMiss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe\nshe had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the\nsusceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she\npassionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized\nhim. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got\ngreat sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out\nof a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his\nfather) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband\nhe must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in\nMiss Havisham's counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love\nto be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with\nthe exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or\njealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she\nwas doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too\nunreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily\nordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has\nnever seen her since.\"\nI thought of her having said, \"Matthew will come and see me at last\nwhen I am laid dead upon that table;\" and I asked Herbert whether his\nfather was so inveterate against her?\n\"It's not that,\" said he, \"but she charged him, in the presence of her\nintended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon\nher for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would\nlook true\u2014even to him\u2014and even to her. To return to the man and make an\nend of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were\nbought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were\ninvited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter\u2014\"\n\"Which she received,\" I struck in, \"when she was dressing for her\nmarriage? At twenty minutes to nine?\"\n\"At the hour and minute,\" said Herbert, nodding, \"at which she\nafterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it\nmost heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I\ndon't know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she\nlaid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never\nsince looked upon the light of day.\"\n\"Is that all the story?\" I asked, after considering it.\n\"All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it\nout for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss\nHavisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was\nabsolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one\nthing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced\nconfidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it\nwas a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.\"\n\"I wonder he didn't marry her and get all the property,\" said I.\n\"He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have\nbeen a part of her half-brother's scheme,\" said Herbert. \"Mind! I don't\nknow that.\"\n\"What became of the two men?\" I asked, after again considering the\nsubject.\n\"They fell into deeper shame and degradation\u2014if there can be deeper\u2014and\nruin.\"\n\"Are they alive now?\"\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but\nadopted. When adopted?\"\nHerbert shrugged his shoulders. \"There has always been an Estella,\nsince I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now,\nHandel,\" said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, \"there is\na perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss\nHavisham, you know.\"\n\"And all that I know,\" I retorted, \"you know.\"\n\"I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity\nbetween you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your\nadvancement in life,\u2014namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to\nwhom you owe it,\u2014you may be very sure that it will never be encroached\nupon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.\"\nIn truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject\ndone with, even though I should be under his father's roof for years\nand years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I\nfelt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as\nI understood the fact myself.\nIt had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for\nthe purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the\nlighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to\nbe the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the",

            "text": "two or three o'clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk\nto Mr. Pocket's house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct\ninto a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket's children\nwere playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my\ninterests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.\nand Mrs. Pocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but\nwere tumbling up.\nMrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\nher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids\nwere looking about them while the children played. \"Mamma,\" said\nHerbert, \"this is young Mr. Pip.\" Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity.\n\"Master Alick and Miss Jane,\" cried one of the nurses to two of the\nchildren, \"if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over\ninto the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?\"\nAt the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket's handkerchief, and\nsaid, \"If that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!\" Upon which\nMrs. Pocket laughed and said, \"Thank you, Flopson,\" and settling\nherself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance\nimmediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been\nreading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,\nshe fixed her eyes upon me, and said, \"I hope your mamma is quite\nwell?\" This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I\nbegan saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such\nperson I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have\nbeen very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the\nnurse came to my rescue.\n\"Well!\" she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, \"if that don't\nmake seven times! What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!\" Mrs.\nPocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\nrecognition, and said, \"Thank you, Flopson,\" and forgot me, and went on\nreading.\nI found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\nsix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the\nregion of air, wailing dolefully.\n\"If there ain't Baby!\" said Flopson, appearing to think it most\nsurprising. \"Make haste up, Millers.\"\nMillers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by\ndegrees the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a\nyoung ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all\nthe time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\nWe were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\nrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\nnear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\ntumbled over her,\u2014always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\ntheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\nthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\nspeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\nwhich baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\nPocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\nand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\n\"Gracious me, Flopson!\" said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\nmoment, \"everybody's tumbling!\"\n\"Gracious you, indeed, Mum!\" returned Flopson, very red in the face;\n\"what have you got there?\"\n\"_I_ got here, Flopson?\" asked Mrs. Pocket.\n\"Why, if it ain't your footstool!\" cried Flopson. \"And if you keep it\nunder your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here! Take the\nbaby, Mum, and give me your book.\"\nMrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\nlittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\nlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made\nthe second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the\nlittle Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\nUnder these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the\nchildren into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket\ncame out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to\nfind that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression\nof face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he\ndidn't quite see his way to putting anything straight.",

I believe he had been knighted himself for\nstorming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate\naddress engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first\nstone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage\neither the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed\nMrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature\nof things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the\nacquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.\nSo successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\nby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but\nperfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,\nin the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was\nalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to\nmount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing\nthe one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket\nhad taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it\nwould seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the\nknowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing\nto bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that\ndower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket\nthat his wife was \"a treasure for a Prince.\" Mr. Pocket had invested\nthe Prince's treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was\nsupposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.\nPocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,\nbecause she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of\na queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.",

It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of\nsaving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the\nservants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their\neating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They\nallowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always\nappeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded\nin would have been the kitchen,\u2014always supposing the boarder capable of\nself-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring lady\nwith whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that\nshe had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs.\nPocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it\nwas an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldn't mind their own\nbusiness.\nBy degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been\neducated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished\nhimself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket\nvery early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the\ncalling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,\u2014of whom\nit was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always\ngoing to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the\nblades had left the Grindstone,\u2014he had wearied of that poor work and\nhad come to London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he\nhad \"read\" with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them,\nand had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned\nhis acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,\nand on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still\nmaintained the house I saw.\nMr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour; a widow lady of that highly\nsympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,\nand shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.\nThis lady's name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking her\ndown to dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand\non the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr.\nPocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read\nwith him. That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and\nconfidence (at that time, I had known her something less than five\nminutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.\n\"But dear Mrs. Pocket,\" said Mrs. Coiler, \"after her early\ndisappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that),\nrequires so much luxury and elegance\u2014\"\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to\ncry.\n\"And she is of so aristocratic a disposition\u2014\"\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I said again, with the same object as before.\n\"\u2014That it _is_ hard,\" said Mrs. Coiler, \"to have dear Mr. Pocket's time\nand attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.\"\nI could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher's time\nand attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,\nand indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company\nmanners.\nIt came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and\nDrummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and\nother instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian\nname was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It\nfurther appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the\ngarden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which\nher grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at\nall. Drummle didn't say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a\nsulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.\nPocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler\nthe toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the\nconversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but\nit promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the",

She had a serpentine way of coming close at me\nwhen she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and\nlocalities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and\nwhen she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little\nto her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for\nbeing on the opposite side of the table.\nAfter dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made\nadmiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,\u2014a sagacious way of\nimproving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little\nboys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby's next\nsuccessor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and\nMillers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been\nrecruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.\nPocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she\nrather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but\ndidn't quite know what to make of them.\n\"Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,\" said Flopson. \"Don't\ntake it that way, or you'll get its head under the table.\"\nThus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon\nthe table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious\nconcussion.\n\"Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,\" said Flopson; \"and Miss Jane, come\nand dance to baby, do!\"\nOne of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely\ntaken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place\nby me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and\nlaughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the\nmeantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,\nand we all laughed and were glad.\nFlopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,\nthen got it safely into Mrs. Pocket's lap, and gave it the nut-crackers\nto play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice\nthat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its\neyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the\ntwo nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase",

I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to\nthe contrary.\nHe advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition\nof such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the\nfunctions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that\nwith intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,\nand should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his.

As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood\nbefore me, dusting his hands.\n\"O yes,\" he returned, \"these are all gifts of that kind.

Heavy in figure, movement, and\ncomprehension,\u2014in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the\nlarge, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he\nhimself lolled about in a room,\u2014he was idle, proud, niggardly,\nreserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,\nwho had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the\ndiscovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley\nDrummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that\ngentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.\nStartop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought\nto have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and\nadmired her beyond measure. He had a woman's delicacy of feature, and\nwas\u2014\"as you may see, though you never saw her,\" said Herbert to\nme\u2014\"exactly like his mother.\" It was but natural that I should take to\nhim much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest\nevenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one\nanother, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up in\nour wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He\nwould always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious\ncreature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and\nI always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the\nback-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the\nmoonlight in mid-stream.",

I presented him with a\nhalf-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down\nto Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often\ntook me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all\nhours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so\npleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of\nuntried youth and hope.\nWhen I had been in Mr. Pocket's family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.\nCamilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket's sister. Georgiana, whom I\nhad seen at Miss Havisham's on the same occasion, also turned up. She\nwas a cousin,\u2014an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity\nreligion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of\ncupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me\nin my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as a\ngrown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the\ncomplacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they held\nin contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily\ndisappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon\nthemselves.\nThese were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied\nmyself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began\nto spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should\nhave thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my\nbooks. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to\nfeel my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast;\nand, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I\nwanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as\ngreat a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.\nI had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write\nhim a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening.

I think it's tender, because the master of the shop was a\nJuryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.\nI reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, \"Pick us out a\ngood one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box\nanother day or two, we could easily have done it.\" He said to that,\n\"Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.\" I let him, of\ncourse.

Come; can't I\ntempt you?\" Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on,\nfor love or money.\"\n\"They dread him so much?\" said I.\n\"Dread him,\" said Wemmick. \"I believe you they dread him. Not but what\nhe's artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia\nmetal, every spoon.\"\n\"So they wouldn't have much,\" I observed, \"even if they\u2014\"\n\"Ah!

A\nriver's its natural depth, and he's his natural depth. Look at his\nwatch-chain. That's real enough.\"\n\"It's very massive,\" said I.\n\"Massive?\" repeated Wemmick. \"I think so.

So, sir,\" said\nWemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, \"if\nyou can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of\na time in point of provisions.\"",

Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that's what he likes. Nod away at\nhim, if you please, like winking!\"\n\"This is a fine place of my son's, sir,\" cried the old man, while I\nnodded as hard as I possibly could. \"This is a pretty pleasure-ground,\nsir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept\ntogether by the Nation, after my son's time, for the people's\nenjoyment.\"\n\"You're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged?\" said Wemmick,\ncontemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened;\n\"_there's_ a nod for you;\" giving him a tremendous one; \"_there's_\nanother for you;\" giving him a still more tremendous one; \"you like\nthat, don't you? If you're not tired, Mr. Pip\u2014though I know it's tiring\nto strangers\u2014will you tip him one more? You can't think how it pleases\nhim.\"\nI tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him\nbestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in\nthe arbour; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had\ntaken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present\npitch of perfection.\n\"Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?\"\n\"O yes,\" said Wemmick, \"I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It's a\nfreehold, by George!\"\n\"Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?\"\n\"Never seen it,\" said Wemmick. \"Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.\nNever heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is\nanother. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and\nwhen I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it's not\nin any way disagreeable to you, you'll oblige me by doing the same. I\ndon't wish it professionally spoken about.\"\nOf course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his\nrequest. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and\ntalking, until it was almost nine o'clock. \"Getting near gun-fire,\"\nsaid Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; \"it's the Aged's treat.\"\nProceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,\nwith expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great\nnightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\nmoment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and\nrepair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the\nStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a\ncottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup\nin it ring. Upon this, the Aged\u2014who I believe would have been blown out\nof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows\u2014cried out exultingly,\n\"He's fired! I heerd him!\" and I nodded at the old gentleman until it\nis no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.\nThe interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me",

He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,\nwhich smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop. It had an\nunusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would\nwash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,\nwhenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his\nroom. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o'clock next day, he\nseemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than\nusual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only\nwashing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And\neven when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,\nhe took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before\nhe put his coat on.",

            "text": "whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was\ncomfortably laid\u2014no silver in the service, of course\u2014and at the side of\nhis chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and\ndecanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed\nthroughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed\neverything himself.\nThere was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\nthat they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,\ntrials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very\nsolid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,\nand there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a\nlittle table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring\nthe office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\nevening and fall to work.\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,\u2014for he and I had\nwalked together,\u2014he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\n\"Pip,\" said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\nthe window, \"I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?\"\n\"The spider?\" said I.\n\"The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.\"\n\"That's Bentley Drummle,\" I replied; \"the one with the delicate face is\nStartop.\"\nNot making the least account of \"the one with the delicate face,\" he\nreturned, \"Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\nfellow.\"\nHe immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to\nscrew discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came\nbetween me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,\u2014but I may have thought her\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\npale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious\nexpression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see\nMacbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked\nto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had\nseen rise out of the Witches' caldron.\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\nat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\nplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\na dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own\nstriking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that\nwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and\na purpose of always holding her in suspense.\nDinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\nthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\nour dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing\nmy tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to\nboast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my\nlips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\nIt was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible\nagency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity\nabout this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show\nhow muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in\na ridiculous manner.\nNow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap,\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\n\"If you talk of strength,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"_I_'ll show you a wrist.\nMolly, let them see your wrist.\"\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\nhand behind her waist. \"Master,\" she said, in a low voice, with her\neyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. \"Don't.\"\n\"_I_'ll show you a wrist,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\ndetermination to show it. \"Molly, let them see your wrist.\"\n\"Master,\" she again murmured. \"Please!\"\n\"Molly,\" said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\nat the opposite side of the room, \"let them see _both_ your wrists.\nShow them. Come!\"\nHe took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\nbrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\nside. The last wrist was much disfigured,\u2014deeply scarred and scarred\nacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\nMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\nin succession.\n\"There's power here,\" said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\nwith his forefinger. \"Very few men have the power of wrist that this\nwoman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\nhands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\nstronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.\"\nWhile he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\nhe ceased, she looked at him again. \"That'll do, Molly,\" said Mr.\nJaggers, giving her a slight nod; \"you have been admired, and can go.\"\nShe withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,\nputting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and\npassed round the wine.\n\"At half-past nine, gentlemen,\" said he, \"we must break up. Pray make\nthe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I\ndrink to you.\"\nIf his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,\nit perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose\ndepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,\nuntil he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.\nJaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed\nto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers's wine.\nIn our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,\nand I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some\nboorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free with\nour money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that\nit came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\npresence but a week or so before.\n\"Well,\" retorted Drummle; \"he'll be paid.\"\n\"I don't mean to imply that he won't,\" said I, \"but it might make you\nhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.\"\n\"_You_ should think!\" retorted Drummle. \"Oh Lord!\"\n\"I dare say,\" I went on, meaning to be very severe, \"that you wouldn't\nlend money to any of us if we wanted it.\"\n\"You are right,\" said Drummle. \"I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence.\nI wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.\"\n\"Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.\"\n\"_You_ should say,\" repeated Drummle. \"Oh Lord!\"\nThis was so very aggravating\u2014the more especially as I found myself\nmaking no way against his surly obtuseness\u2014that I said, disregarding\nHerbert's efforts to check me,\u2014\n\"Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what\npassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.\"\n\"_I_ don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,\"\ngrowled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.\n\"I'll tell you, however,\" said I, \"whether you want to know or not. We\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.\"\nDrummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\nit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\nHereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\nI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\nbeing a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\nopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\npersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\nus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,\nDrummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his\npockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and\nwould have flung it at his adversary's head, but for our entertainer's\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\npurpose.\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, \"I am exceedingly\nsorry to announce that it's half past nine.\"\nOn this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\nStartop was cheerily calling Drummle \"old boy,\" as if nothing had\nhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\neven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\nwho remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\nStartop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the\nhouses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.\nAs the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for\na moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found\nhim in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard\nat it, washing his hands of us.\nI told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything\ndisagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame\nme much.\n\"Pooh!\" said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the\nwater-drops; \"it's nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.\"\nHe had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing,\nand towelling himself.\n\"I am glad you like him, sir,\" said I\u2014\"but I don't.\"\n\"No, no,\" my guardian assented; \"don't have too much to do with him.\nKeep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one\nof the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller\u2014\"\nLooking out of the towel, he caught my eye.\n\"But I am not a fortune-teller,\" he said, letting his head drop into a\nfestoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. \"You know what I\nam, don't you? Good night, Pip.\"\n\"Good night, sir.\"",

            "text": "I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its\nappointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings\nI looked forward to Joe's coming.\nNot with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with\nconsiderable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of\nincongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly\nwould have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming\nto Barnard's Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall\nin Bentley Drummle's way. I had little objection to his being seen by\nHerbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the\nsharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in\ncontempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are\nusually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\nI had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite\nunnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those\nwrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastly\ndifferent from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honour of\noccupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring\nupholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a\nboy in boots,\u2014top boots,\u2014in bondage and slavery to whom I might have\nbeen said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of\nthe refuse of my washerwoman's family), and had clothed him with a blue\ncoat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots\nalready mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to\neat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my\nexistence.\nThis avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday\nmorning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for\nfloorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he\nthought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being\nso interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of\nsuspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see _him_, he\nwouldn't have been quite so brisk about it.\nHowever, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and\nI got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and\nbreakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately\nthe morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact\nthat Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some\nweak giant of a Sweep.\nAs the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger\npursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the\nstaircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming\nupstairs,\u2014his state boots being always too big for him,\u2014and by the time",

Give me your hat.\"\nBut Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird's-nest\nwith eggs in it, wouldn't hear of parting with that piece of property,\nand persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.\n\"Which you have that growed,\" said Joe, \"and that swelled, and that\ngentle-folked;\" Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;\n\"as to be sure you are a honour to your king and country.\"\n\"And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.\"\n\"Thank God,\" said Joe, \"I'm ekerval to most. And your sister, she's no\nworse than she were. And Biddy, she's ever right and ready. And all\nfriends is no backerder, if not no forarder. 'Ceptin Wopsle; he's had a\ndrop.\"\nAll this time (still with both hands taking great care of the\nbird's-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and\nround and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.\n\"Had a drop, Joe?\"\n\"Why yes,\" said Joe, lowering his voice, \"he's left the Church and went\ninto the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him to\nLondon along with me. And his wish were,\" said Joe, getting the\nbird's-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an\negg with his right; \"if no offence, as I would 'and you that.\"\nI took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a\nsmall metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that\nvery week, of \"the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,\nwhose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National\nBard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic\ncircles.\"\n\"Were you at his performance, Joe?\" I inquired.\n\"I _were_,\" said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.\n\"Was there a great sensation?\"\n\"Why,\" said Joe, \"yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.\nPartickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,\nwhether it were calc'lated to keep a man up to his work with a good\nhart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with\n\"Amen!\" A man may have had a misfortun' and been in the Church,\" said\nJoe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, \"but that\nis no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I\nmeantersay, if the ghost of a man's own father cannot be allowed to\nclaim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning 'at\nis unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers\nbrings it off, try to keep it on how you may.\"\nA ghost-seeing effect in Joe's own countenance informed me that Herbert\nhad entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his\nhand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird's-nest.\n\"Your servant, Sir,\" said Joe, \"which I hope as you and Pip\"\u2014here his\neye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so\nplainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the\nfamily, that I frowned it down and confused him more\u2014\"I meantersay, you\ntwo gentlemen,\u2014which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?\nFor the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,\"\nsaid Joe, confidentially, \"and I believe its character do stand it; but\nI wouldn't keep a pig in it myself,\u2014not in the case that I wished him\nto fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him.\"\nHaving borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our\ndwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me\n\"sir,\" Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the\nroom for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,\u2014as if it were\nonly on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a\nresting place,\u2014and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the\nchimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.\n\"Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?\" asked Herbert, who always\npresided of a morning.\n\"Thankee, Sir,\" said Joe, stiff from head to foot, \"I'll take whichever\nis most agreeable to yourself.\"\n\"What do you say to coffee?\"\n\"Thankee, Sir,\" returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,\n\"since you _are_ so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run\ncontrairy to your own opinions. But don't you never find it a little\n'eating?\"\n\"Say tea then,\" said Herbert, pouring it out.\nHere Joe's hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his\nchair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it\nwere an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again\nsoon.\n\"When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?\"\n\"Were it yesterday afternoon?\" said Joe, after coughing behind his\nhand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came.\n\"No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon\" (with\nan appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).\n\"Have you seen anything of London yet?\"\n\"Why, yes, Sir,\" said Joe, \"me and Wopsle went off straight to look at\nthe Blacking Ware'us. But we didn't find that it come up to its\nlikeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,\" added\nJoe, in an explanatory manner, \"as it is there drawd too\narchitectooralooral.\"\nI really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily\nexpressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect\nChorus, but for his attention being providentially attracted by his\nhat, which was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant\nattention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by\nwicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the\ngreatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it\ndropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouring\nit in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern\nof the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it;\nfinally splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of\nlaying hands upon it.\n[Illustration]\nAs to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to\nreflect upon,\u2014insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself\nto that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why\nshould he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his\nholiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of\nmeditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had\nhis eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such\nremarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more\nthan he ate, and pretended that he hadn't dropped it; that I was\nheartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.\nI had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was\nall my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have\nbeen easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with\nhim; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.",

They wore the dress that I\nlikewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a\nthick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good\nunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at\nthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts\nwere an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he\nthe Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and\nappeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the\nworld, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller\nsuit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those\nshapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his\nhalf-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on\nthe settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had\nbrought me down with his invisible gun!\nIt was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\nnever seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye\nappraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said\nsomething to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves\nround with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something\nelse. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;\ntheir coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower\nanimals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with\npocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them\nand kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable\nand degraded spectacle.",

At this time the\ncoach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing\nto get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,\u2014bringing\nwith them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and\nhearthstone, which attends the convict presence.\n\"Don't take it so much amiss, sir,\" pleaded the keeper to the angry\npassenger; \"I'll sit next you myself.

I thought what a\nblessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.\nIt is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's\nbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\nsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\nbreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\ndoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,\nin my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.\nThe weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us\nall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way\nHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed\noff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\nand how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\nwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\nquestion up again.\nBut I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I\ncould recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\nshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\nblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\nthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\nwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\nmy own thought, \"Two One Pound notes.\"\n\"How did he get 'em?\" said the convict I had never seen.\n\"How should I know?\" returned the other. \"He had 'em stowed away\nsomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.\"\n\"I wish,\" said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, \"that I\nhad 'em here.\"\n\"Two one pound notes, or friends?\"\n\"Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\nthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says\u2014?\"\n\"So he says,\" resumed the convict I had recognised,\u2014\"it was all said\nand done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\nDock-yard,\u2014'You're a-going to be discharged?' Yes, I was. Would I find\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\none pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.\"\n\"More fool you,\" growled the other. \"I'd have spent 'em on a Man, in\nwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\nnothing of you?\"\n\"Not a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried\nagain for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.\"\n\"And was that\u2014Honour!\u2014the only time you worked out, in this part of the\ncountry?\"\n\"The only time.\"\n\"What might have been your opinion of the place?\"\n\"A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\nmist, and mudbank.\"\nThey both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\ngrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.",

It was too early yet to go to\nMiss Havisham's, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham's side\nof town,\u2014which was not Joe's side; I could go there to-morrow,\u2014thinking\nabout my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for\nme.\nShe had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could\nnot fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for\nme to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark\nrooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down\nthe cobwebs, destroy the vermin,\u2014in short, do all the shining deeds of\nthe young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to\nlook at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked\nwindows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with\nits twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich\nattractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the\ninspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had\ntaken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so\nset upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had\nbeen all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her\nwith any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this\nplace, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be\nfollowed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the\nconventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified\ntruth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her\nsimply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my\nsorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against\nreason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against\nhappiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I\nloved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence\nin restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human\nperfection.",

In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of\nplace usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were\nhanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his\npatchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. The\nwhole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a\nhuman dormouse; while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a\ncorner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was\nfitted up,\u2014as indeed he was.\n\"I never saw this room before,\" I remarked; \"but there used to be no\nPorter here.\"\n\"No,\" said he; \"not till it got about that there was no protection on\nthe premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and\nTag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended\nto the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought,\nand I took it. It's easier than bellowsing and hammering.\u2014That's\nloaded, that is.\"\nMy eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the\nchimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.\n\"Well,\" said I, not desirous of more conversation, \"shall I go up to\nMiss Havisham?\"\n\"Burn me, if I know!\" he retorted, first stretching himself and then\nshaking himself; \"my orders ends here, young master. I give this here\nbell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till\nyou meet somebody.\"\n\"I am expected, I believe?\"\n\"Burn me twice over, if I can say!\" said he.\nUpon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in\nmy thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,\nwhile the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who\nappeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason\nof me.\n\"Oh!\" said she. \"You, is it, Mr. Pip?\"\n\"It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family\nare all well.\"\n\"Are they any wiser?\" said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head;\n\"they had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know\nyour way, sir?\"\nTolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I\nascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old\nway at the door of Miss Havisham's room. \"Pip's rap,\" I heard her say,\nimmediately; \"come in, Pip.\"\nShe was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two\nhands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on\nthe fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been\nworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an\nelegant lady whom I had never seen.\n\"Come in, Pip,\" Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking\nround or up; \"come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as\nif I were a queen, eh?\u2014Well?\"\nShe looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a\ngrimly playful manner,\u2014\n\"Well?\"\n\"I heard, Miss Havisham,\" said I, rather at a loss, \"that you were so\nkind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.\"\n\"Well?\"\nThe lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked\narchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella's eyes. But she\nwas so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,\nin all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that\nI seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that I\nslipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O the\nsense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the\ninaccessibility that came about her!\nShe gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt\nin seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a\nlong, long time.\n\"Do you find her much changed, Pip?\" asked Miss Havisham, with her\ngreedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between\nthem, as a sign to me to sit down there.\n\"When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella\nin the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into\nthe old\u2014\"\n\"What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?\" Miss Havisham\ninterrupted. \"She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away\nfrom her. Don't you remember?\"\nI said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better\nthen, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she\nhad no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very\ndisagreeable.\n\"Is _he_ changed?\" Miss Havisham asked her.\n\"Very much,\" said Estella, looking at me.\n\"Less coarse and common?\" said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella's\nhair.\nEstella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,\nand looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,\nbut she lured me on.\nWe sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so\nwrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from\nFrance, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,\nshe had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that\nit was impossible and out of nature\u2014or I thought so\u2014to separate them\nfrom her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence\nfrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had\ndisturbed my boyhood,\u2014from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had\nfirst made me ashamed of home and Joe,\u2014from all those visions that had\nraised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the\nanvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden\nwindow of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me\nto separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life\nof my life.\nIt was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and\nreturn to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had\nconversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the\nneglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel\nher about a little, as in times of yore.",

As\nwe drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,\u2014\n\"I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\nthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.\"\n\"You rewarded me very much.\"\n\"Did I?\" she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. \"I remember I\nentertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.\"\n\"He and I are great friends now.\"\n\"Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nI made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\nlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\n\"Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\ncompanions,\" said Estella.\n\"Naturally,\" said I.\n\"And necessarily,\" she added, in a haughty tone; \"what was fit company\nfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.\"\nIn my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\nintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\nit to flight.\n\"You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?\" said\nEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\ntimes.\n\"Not the least.\"\nThe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\nside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\nhers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\nmore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\nso set apart for her and assigned to her.\nThe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\ninto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\nwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\ncareless look in that direction, \"Did I?\" I reminded her where she had\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, \"I\ndon't remember.\" \"Not remember that you made me cry?\" said I. \"No,\"\nsaid she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe\nthat her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry\nagain, inwardly,\u2014and that is the sharpest crying of all.\n\"You must know,\" said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\nbeautiful woman might, \"that I have no heart,\u2014if that has anything to\ndo with my memory.\"\nI got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\ndoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\nwithout it.\n\"Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,\" said\nEstella, \"and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But\nyou know what I mean. I have no softness there,\nno\u2014sympathy\u2014sentiment\u2014nonsense.\"\nWhat _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\nlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?\nNo. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of\nresemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been\nacquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much\nassociated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will\nproduce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces\nthat are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to\nMiss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,\nthe suggestion was gone.\nWhat _was_ it?\n\"I am serious,\" said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow\nwas smooth) as with a darkening of her face; \"if we are to be thrown\nmuch together, you had better believe it at once. No!\" imperiously\nstopping me as I opened my lips. \"I have not bestowed my tenderness\nanywhere. I have never had any such thing.\"\nIn another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\npointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\nfirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to\nhave seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand,\nagain the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed\nme. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.\nInstantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.\nWhat _was_ it?\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Estella. \"Are you scared again?\"\n\"I should be, if I believed what you said just now,\" I replied, to turn\nit off.\n\"Then you don't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\nsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\nlaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\nof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\ncruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.\"\nHer handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\nnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\nbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it\ncould not have been more cherished in my remembrance.\nThere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\nwe were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\nin her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\nbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my",

            "text": "delight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness\nhad chosen us for one another. Wretched boy!\nAt last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\nthat my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\nwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while\nwe were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\nIt was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in\nthe funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\nchair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and\nbeautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\nThe time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\nand Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\nof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\nstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\ncloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\ndoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful.\nThen, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\nsaid in a whisper,\u2014\n\"Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?\"\n\"Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.\"\nShe drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\nshe sat in the chair. \"Love her, love her, love her! How does she use\nyou?\"\nBefore I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\nat all) she repeated, \"Love her, love her, love her! If she favours\nyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\npieces,\u2014and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,\u2014love\nher, love her, love her!\"\nNever had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\nutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm\nround my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\n\"Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\nto be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\nLove her!\"\nShe said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\nmeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead\nof love\u2014despair\u2014revenge\u2014dire death\u2014it could not have sounded from her\nlips more like a curse.\n\"I'll tell you,\" said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,\n\"what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning\nself-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself\nand against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the\nsmiter\u2014as I did!\"\nWhen she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\nher round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\ndress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck\nherself against the wall and fallen dead.\nAll this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\nwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\nthe room.\nHe always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\npocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\nof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as\nif he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or\nwitness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\ndirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he\nhad this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking\nat us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent\npause in that attitude, \"Indeed? Singular!\" and then put the\nhandkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.\nMiss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)\nafraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever.\n\"As punctual as ever,\" he repeated, coming up to us. \"(How do you do,\nPip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you\nare here, Pip?\"\nI told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\ncome and see Estella. To which he replied, \"Ah! Very fine young lady!\"\nThen he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\nlarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\nwere full of secrets.\n\"Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?\" said he, when\nhe came to a stop.\n\"How often?\"\n\"Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?\"\n\"Oh! Certainly not so many.\"\n\"Twice?\"\n\"Jaggers,\" interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, \"leave my Pip\nalone, and go with him to your dinner.\"\nHe complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\nyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\nand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\ntimes and once.\nI considered, and said, \"Never.\"\n\"And never will, Pip,\" he retorted, with a frowning smile. \"She has\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\npresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\nhands on such food as she takes.\"\n\"Pray, sir,\" said I, \"may I ask you a question?\"\n\"You may,\" said he, \"and I may decline to answer it. Put your\nquestion.\"\n\"Estella's name. Is it Havisham or\u2014?\" I had nothing to add.\n\"Or what?\" said he.\n\"Is it Havisham?\"\n\"It is Havisham.\"\nThis brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\nus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green\nand yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\nmaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\nwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\ntime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\nguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\ntwo ladies left us.\nAnything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\nroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\nhimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella's face once during\ndinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\nbut never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\nlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\nface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a\ndry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,\nhe showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\nextorted\u2014and even did extort, though I don't know how\u2014those references\nout of my innocent self.\nAnd when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that\nreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had\nnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted\nthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass\nagain, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and\ncross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had\nknown the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or\nfour times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he\nsaw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his\nhand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to\ntake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn't answer.\nI think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in\nthe danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her\ncap,\u2014which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,\u2014and\nstrewing the ground with her hair,\u2014which assuredly had never grown on\n_her_ head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss\nHavisham's room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss\nHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels\nfrom her dressing-table into Estella's hair, and about her bosom and\narms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\neyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.\n[Illustration]\nOf the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the\nglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor,\nof the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in\nthe light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out\nlong ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his\ncold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I\ncould never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never\nbear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear\nto see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be\nwithin a foot or two of him,\u2014it was, that my feelings should be in the\nsame place with him,\u2014_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.\nWe played until nine o'clock, and then it was arranged that when\nEstella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should\nmeet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her\nand left her.\nMy guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the\nnight, Miss Havisham's words, \"Love her, love her, love her!\" sounded\nin my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my\npillow, \"I love her, I love her, I love her!\" hundreds of times. Then,\na burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me,\nonce the blacksmith's boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by\nno means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she\nbegin to be interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her\nthat was mute and sleeping now?\nAh me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never\nthought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe,\nbecause I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone,\nand Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God\nforgive me! soon dried.",

By then making a loop of about a couple of\nmiles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook's premises, I\ngot round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and\nfelt myself in comparative security.\nIt was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was\nnot disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared\nafter. One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops\nand went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn,\nas if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,\u2014on which\noccasions I don't know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they\nof not doing it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a\ndistinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until\nFate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb's boy.\nCasting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I\nbeheld Trabb's boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.\nDeeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best\nbeseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced\nwith that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating\nmyself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb's boy smote\ntogether, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in\nevery limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,\n\"Hold me! I'm so frightened!\" feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and\ncontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed\nhim, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of\nextreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.\nThis was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced\nanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,\nand indignation, I again beheld Trabb's boy approaching. He was coming\nround a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest\nindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb's with\ncheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became\naware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his\nmotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees\nmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His\nsufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,\nand I felt utterly confounded.\nI had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when\nI again beheld Trabb's boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he\nwas entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my\ngreat-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the\nopposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young\nfriends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his\nhand, \"Don't know yah!\" Words cannot state the amount of aggravation\nand injury wreaked upon me by Trabb's boy, when passing abreast of me,\nhe pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm\nakimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,\nand drawling to his attendants, \"Don't know yah, don't know yah, 'pon\nmy soul don't know yah!\" The disgrace attendant on his immediately\nafterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with\ncrows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was\na blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and\nwas, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.",

            "text": "I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.\nHaving despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to\nthe dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my\nfriend and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger\nin the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an\nantechamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of\nthe severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be\nafforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to\nfind him employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to\nHyde Park corner to see what o'clock it was.\nDinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to\nHerbert, \"My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell\nyou.\"\n\"My dear Handel,\" he returned, \"I shall esteem and respect your\nconfidence.\"\n\"It concerns myself, Herbert,\" said I, \"and one other person.\"\nHerbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,\nand having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I\ndidn't go on.\n\"Herbert,\" said I, laying my hand upon his knee, \"I love\u2014I\nadore\u2014Estella.\"\nInstead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy\nmatter-of-course way, \"Exactly. Well?\"\n\"Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?\"\n\"What next, I mean?\" said Herbert. \"Of course I know _that_.\"\n\"How do you know it?\" said I.\n\"How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.\"\n\"I never told you.\"\n\"Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I\nhave had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since\nI have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here\ntogether. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you\ntold me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her\nthe first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.\"\n\"Very well, then,\" said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome\nlight, \"I have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a\nmost beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And\nif I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.\"\n\"Lucky for you then, Handel,\" said Herbert, \"that you are picked out\nfor her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground,\nwe may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of\nthat fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella's views on the adoration\nquestion?\"\nI shook my head gloomily. \"Oh! She is thousands of miles away, from\nme,\" said I.\n\"Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have\nsomething more to say?\"\n\"I am ashamed to say it,\" I returned, \"and yet it's no worse to say it\nthan to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a\nblacksmith's boy but yesterday; I am\u2014what shall I say I am\u2014to-day?\"\n\"Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase,\" returned Herbert, smiling,\nand clapping his hand on the back of mine\u2014\"a good fellow, with\nimpetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and\ndreaming, curiously mixed in him.\"\nI stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this\nmixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognised the\nanalysis, but thought it not worth disputing.\n\"When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,\" I went on, \"I\nsuggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have\ndone nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised\nme; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella\u2014\"\n(\"And when don't you, you know?\" Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the\nfire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)\n\"\u2014Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain\nI feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden\nground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of\none person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the\nbest, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what\nthey are!\" In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been\nthere, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.\n\"Now, Handel,\" Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, \"it seems to\nme that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into\nour gift-horse's mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to\nme that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether\noverlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn't you tell me that\nyour guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were\nnot endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you\nso,\u2014though that is a very large If, I grant,\u2014could you believe that of\nall men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations\ntowards you unless he were sure of his ground?\"\nI said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people\noften do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth\nand justice;\u2014as if I wanted to deny it!\n\"I should think it _was_ a strong point,\" said Herbert, \"and I should\nthink you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you\nmust bide your guardian's time, and he must bide his client's time.\nYou'll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then\nperhaps you'll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you'll be\nnearer getting it, for it must come at last.\"\n\"What a hopeful disposition you have!\" said I, gratefully admiring his\ncheery ways.\n\"I ought to have,\" said Herbert, \"for I have not much else. I must\nacknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is\nnot my own, but my father's. The only remark I ever heard him make on\nyour story, was the final one, \"The thing is settled and done, or Mr.\nJaggers would not be in it.\" And now before I say anything more about\nmy father, or my father's son, and repay confidence with confidence, I\nwant to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a\nmoment,\u2014positively repulsive.\"\n\"You won't succeed,\" said I.\n\"O yes I shall!\" said he. \"One, two, three, and now I am in for it.\nHandel, my good fellow;\"\u2014though he spoke in this light tone, he was\nvery much in earnest,\u2014\"I have been thinking since we have been talking\nwith our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition\nof your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am\nI right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never\nreferred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,\nfor instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage\nultimately?\"\n\"Never.\"\n\"Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes, upon my\nsoul and honour! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself\nfrom her?\u2014I told you I should be disagreeable.\"\nI turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old\nmarsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had\nsubdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were\nsolemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post,\nsmote upon my heart again. There was silence between us for a little\nwhile.\n\"Yes; but my dear Handel,\" Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,\ninstead of silent, \"its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of\na boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very\nserious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of\nwhat she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may\nlead to miserable things.\"\n\"I know it, Herbert,\" said I, with my head still turned away, \"but I\ncan't help it.\"\n\"You can't detach yourself?\"\n\"No. Impossible!\"\n\"You can't try, Handel?\"",

I suppose there was a time once when my father had not\ngiven matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask\nyou if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part\nof the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are\nalways most particularly anxious to be married?\"\nThis was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, \"Is it\nso?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Herbert, \"that's what I want to know. Because it\nis decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next\nme and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little\nJane is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you\nmight suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual\ncontemplation of domestic bliss.

Which was not at all what I meant,\nfor I had intended my question to apply to his means. \"I have never\nseen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known\nClara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous\nrows,\u2014roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.\" In\nlooking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time\nrecovered his usual lively manner.\n\"Don't you expect to see him?\" said I.\n\"O yes, I constantly expect to see him,\" returned Herbert, \"because I\nnever hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the\nceiling.

            "text": "On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country\nelevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The\nwhole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble\nboy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer\nwith a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in\nlife, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of\nwhite silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My\ngifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could\nhave wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.\nSeveral curious little circumstances transpired as the action\nproceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been\ntroubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it\nwith him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom\nalso carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had\nthe appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of\nanxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were\nsuggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led\nto the Shade's being advised by the gallery to \"turn over!\"\u2014a\nrecommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted\nof this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of\nhaving been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it\nperceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its\nterrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom\nlady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public\nto have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem\nby a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her\nwaist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so\nthat she was openly mentioned as \"the kettle-drum.\" The noble boy in\nthe ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were\nin one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a\nclergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court\nfencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice\ndiscrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a\nwant of toleration for him, and even\u2014on his being detected in holy\norders, and declining to perform the funeral service\u2014to the general\nindignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such\nslow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off\nher white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who\nhad been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the\nfront row of the gallery, growled, \"Now the baby's put to bed let's\nhave supper!\" Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.\nUpon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with\nplayful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or\nstate a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on\nthe question whether 'twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared\nyes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said \"Toss up for\nit;\" and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such\nfellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged\nwith loud cries of \"Hear, hear!\" When he appeared with his stocking\ndisordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very\nneat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat\niron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness\nof his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had\ngiven him. On his taking the recorders,\u2014very like a little black flute\nthat had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the\ndoor,\u2014he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he\nrecommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said,\n\"And don't _you_ do it, neither; you're a deal worse than _him_!\" And I\ngrieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of\nthese occasions.",

Shall we follow you?\"\n\"A few steps, please.\" When we were in a side alley, he turned and\nasked, \"How did you think he looked?\u2014I dressed him.\"\nI don't know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the\naddition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue\nribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some\nextraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.\n\"When he come to the grave,\" said our conductor, \"he showed his cloak\nbeautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he see\nthe ghost in the queen's apartment, he might have made more of his\nstockings.\"\nI modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,\ninto a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle\nwas divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just\nroom for us to look at him over one another's shoulders, by keeping the\npacking-case door, or lid, wide open.\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Wopsle, \"I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,\nyou will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in\nformer times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been\nacknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to\nget himself out of his princely sables.\n\"Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,\" said the owner of that\nproperty, \"or you'll bust 'em. Bust 'em, and you'll bust\nfive-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a\nfiner pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave 'em to me.\"\nWith that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who,\non the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over\nbackward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.\nI had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then,\nMr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,\u2014\n\"Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?\"\nHerbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), \"Capitally.\" So\nI said \"Capitally.\"\n\"How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?\" said Mr.\nWaldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.\nHerbert said from behind (again poking me), \"Massive and concrete.\" So\nI said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon\nit, \"Massive and concrete.\"\n\"I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Waldengarver,\nwith an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall\nat the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.\n\"But I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,\" said the man who was\non his knees, \"in which you're out in your reading. Now mind! I don't\ncare who says contrairy; I tell you so. You're out in your reading of\nHamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed,\nmade the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to\nput a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal\n(which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and\nwhenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out \"I don't\nsee no wafers!\" And at night his reading was lovely.\"\nMr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say \"a faithful\nDependent\u2014I overlook his folly;\" and then said aloud, \"My view is a\nlittle classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,\nthey will improve.\"\nHerbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.\n\"Did you observe, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Waldengarver, \"that there was a\nman in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service,\u2014I\nmean, the representation?\"\nWe basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I\nadded, \"He was drunk, no doubt.\"\n\"O dear no, sir,\" said Mr. Wopsle, \"not drunk. His employer would see\nto that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.\"\n\"You know his employer?\" said I.\nMr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both\nceremonies very slowly. \"You must have observed, gentlemen,\" said he,\n\"an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance\nexpressive of low malignity, who went through\u2014I will not say\nsustained\u2014the r\u00f4le (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King\nof Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!\"\nWithout distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for\nMr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,\nthat I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put\non,\u2014which jostled us out at the doorway,\u2014to ask Herbert what he thought\nof having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would be kind\nto do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard's with us,\nwrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until\ntwo o'clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his\nplans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general\nrecollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end\nwith crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft\nand without a chance or hope.",

At that time jails were much\nneglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all\npublic wrongdoing\u2014and which is always its heaviest and longest\npunishment\u2014was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better\nthan soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their\nprisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their\nsoup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was\ngoing his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards,\nwere buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly,\ndisorderly, depressing scene it was.\nIt struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener\nmight walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his\nseeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, \"What,\nCaptain Tom? Are _you_ there? Ah, indeed!\" and also, \"Is that Black\nBill behind the cistern? Why I didn't look for you these two months;\nhow do you find yourself?\" Equally in his stopping at the bars and\nattending to anxious whisperers,\u2014always singly,\u2014Wemmick with his\npost-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference,\nas if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made,\nsince last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.\nHe was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department\nof Mr. Jaggers's business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers\nhung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His\npersonal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,\nand in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both\nhands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in\nhis pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting\nthe raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible\nfrom the insufficient money produced, said, \"it's no use, my boy. I'm\nonly a subordinate. I can't take it. Don't go on in that way with a\nsubordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had\nbetter address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals\nin the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one,\nmay be worth the while of another; that's my recommendation to you,\nspeaking as a subordinate. Don't try on useless measures. Why should\nyou? Now, who's next?\"\nThus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until he turned to me and\nsaid, \"Notice the man I shall shake hands with.\" I should have done so,\nwithout the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.\nAlmost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see\nnow, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with a\npeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that\nwent wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of\nthe bars, and put his hand to his hat\u2014which had a greasy and fatty\nsurface like cold broth\u2014with a half-serious and half-jocose military\nsalute.\n\"Colonel, to you!\" said Wemmick; \"how are you, Colonel?\"\n\"All right, Mr. Wemmick.\"\n\"Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too\nstrong for us, Colonel.\"\n\"Yes, it was too strong, sir,\u2014but _I_ don't care.\"\n\"No, no,\" said Wemmick, coolly, \"_you_ don't care.\" Then, turning to\nme, \"Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought\nhis discharge.\"\nI said, \"Indeed?\" and the man's eyes looked at me, and then looked over\nmy head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across\nhis lips and laughed.\n\"I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,\" he said to Wemmick.\n\"Perhaps,\" returned my friend, \"but there's no knowing.\"\n\"I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,\"\nsaid the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.\n\"Thankye,\" said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. \"Same to you,\nColonel.\"\n\"If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,\" said the\nman, unwilling to let his hand go, \"I should have asked the favour of\nyour wearing another ring\u2014in acknowledgment of your attentions.\"\n\"I'll accept the will for the deed,\" said Wemmick. \"By the by; you were\nquite a pigeon-fancier.\" The man looked up at the sky. \"I am told you\nhad a remarkable breed of tumblers. _Could_ you commission any friend\nof yours to bring me a pair, if you've no further use for 'em?\"\n\"It shall be done, sir.\"\n\"All right,\" said Wemmick, \"they shall be taken care of.\nGood-afternoon, Colonel. Good-bye!\" They shook hands again, and as we\nwalked away Wemmick said to me, \"A Coiner, a very good workman. The\nRecorder's report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on\nMonday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are\nportable property all the same.\" With that, he looked back, and nodded\nat this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of\nthe yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its\nplace.",

            "text": "\"Where are you going to, at Richmond?\" I asked Estella.\n\"I am going to live,\" said she, \"at a great expense, with a lady there,\nwho has the power\u2014or says she has\u2014of taking me about, and introducing\nme, and showing people to me and showing me to people.\"\n\"I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?\"\n\"Yes, I suppose so.\"\nShe answered so carelessly, that I said, \"You speak of yourself as if\nyou were some one else.\"\n\"Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,\" said Estella,\nsmiling delightfully, \"you must not expect me to go to school to _you_;\nI must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?\"\n\"I live quite pleasantly there; at least\u2014\" It appeared to me that I was\nlosing a chance.\n\"At least?\" repeated Estella.\n\"As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.\"\n\"You silly boy,\" said Estella, quite composedly, \"how can you talk such\nnonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest\nof his family?\"\n\"Very superior indeed. He is nobody's enemy\u2014\"\n\"Don't add but his own,\" interposed Estella, \"for I hate that class of\nman. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and\nspite, I have heard?\"\n\"I am sure I have every reason to say so.\"\n\"You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,\" said\nEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\ngrave and rallying, \"for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and\ninsinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,\nwrite letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment\nand the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourself\nthe hatred those people feel for you.\"\n\"They do me no harm, I hope?\"\nInstead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very\nsingular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When\nshe left off\u2014and she had not laughed languidly, but with real\nenjoyment\u2014I said, in my diffident way with her,\u2014\n\"I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\nharm.\"\n\"No, no you may be sure of that,\" said Estella. \"You may be certain\nthat I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and\nthe tortures they undergo!\" She laughed again, and even now when she\nhad told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not\ndoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I\nthought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw\nthe thought in my mind, and answered it.\n\"It is not easy for even you.\" said Estella, \"to know what satisfaction\nit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of\nthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not\nbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not\nyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed\nand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\nis soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round\nchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\nwoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\nin the night. I did.\"\nIt was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these\nremembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of\nthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.\n\"Two things I can tell you,\" said Estella. \"First, notwithstanding the\nproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your\nmind at rest that these people never will\u2014never would in a hundred\nyears\u2014impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great\nor small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\nbusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.\"\nAs she gave it to me playfully,\u2014for her darker mood had been but\nmomentary\u2014I held it and put it to my lips. \"You ridiculous boy,\" said\nEstella, \"will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the\nsame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?\"\n\"What spirit was that?\" said I.\n\"I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and\nplotters.\"\n\"If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?\"\n\"You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you\nlike.\"\nI leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue's. \"Now,\" said\nEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, \"you are to take\ncare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.\"\nHer reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,\nand we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our\nintercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,\nI could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on\nagainst trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it\nalways was.\nI rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,\nbrought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of\ntea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and\nforks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek\nlittle muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron\ncover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a\nquantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof\nimpressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of\nbread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in\nwith, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a\nprolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came\nback with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I\nsteeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances\nextracted one cup of I don't know what for Estella.\nThe bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,\nand the chambermaid taken into consideration,\u2014in a word, the whole\nhouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella's\npurse much lightened,\u2014we got into our post-coach and drove away.",

As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,\n\"Wretches!\" I would not have confessed to my visit for any\nconsideration.\n\"Mr. Jaggers,\" said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,\n\"has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\nthan any man in London.\"\n\"He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,\" said Estella, in a\nlow voice.\n\"You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?\"\n\"I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I\ncan remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could\nspeak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with\nhim?\"\n\"Once habituated to his distrustful manner,\" said I, \"I have done very\nwell.\"\n\"Are you intimate?\"\n\"I have dined with him at his private house.\"\n\"I fancy,\" said Estella, shrinking \"that must be a curious place.\"\n\"It is a curious place.\"\nI should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\nher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\nthe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden\nglare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive\nwith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out\nof it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in\nlightning.\nSo we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by\nwhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this\nside of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she\ntold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham's neighbourhood until she\nhad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in\ngoing and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\nwhile she remained here? To that she emphatically said \"God forbid!\"\nand no more.\nIt was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;\nthat she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task\nhad needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she\nhad not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should\nhave felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose\nto do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to\ncrush it and throw it away.\nWhen we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew\nPocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I\nhoped I should see her sometimes.\n\"O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you\nare to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.\"\nI inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?\n\"No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of\nsome station, though not averse to increasing her income.\"\n\"I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.\"\n\"It is a part of Miss Havisham's plans for me, Pip,\" said Estella, with\na sigh, as if she were tired; \"I am to write to her constantly and see\nher regularly and report how I go on,\u2014I and the jewels,\u2014for they are\nnearly all mine now.\"\nIt was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she\ndid so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.\nWe came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house\nby the green,\u2014a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,\nembroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their\ncourt days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still\ncut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and\nstiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of\nthe dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go\nthe silent way of the rest.\nA bell with an old voice\u2014which I dare say in its time had often said to\nthe house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted\nsword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire\u2014sounded\ngravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering\nout to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she\ngave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbed\nlikewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I\nshould be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy\nwith her, but always miserable.",

I always thought this was business, this was the way to\nconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\nI know Herbert thought so too.\nWe ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\nsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds\nmight be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the\nmark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of\nink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was\nsomething very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\nI would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in\na neat hand, the heading, \"Memorandum of Pip's debts\"; with Barnard's\nInn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet\nof paper, and write across it with similar formalities, \"Memorandum of\nHerbert's debts.\"\nEach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\nwhich had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\nburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\notherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us\nexceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to\ndistinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually\npaying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things\nseemed about equal.\nWhen we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?\nHerbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\nmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.\n\"They are mounting up, Handel,\" Herbert would say; \"upon my life, they\nare mounting up.\"\n\"Be firm, Herbert,\" I would retort, plying my own pen with great\nassiduity. \"Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare\nthem out of countenance.\"\n\"So I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance.\"\nHowever, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would\nfall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the\nplea that he had not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the\ncase might be.\n\"Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it\ndown.\"\n\"What a fellow of resource you are!\" my friend would reply, with\nadmiration. \"Really your business powers are very remarkable.\"\nI thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the\nreputation of a first-rate man of business,\u2014prompt, decisive,\nenergetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities\ndown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My\nself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.\nWhen I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,\ndocketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical\nbundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not\nmy administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into\na focus for him.",

Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert's\ncompliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the\ntable before me among the stationery, and feel like a Bank of some\nsort, rather than a private individual.\nWe shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we\nmight not be interrupted.

When I had spoken to Biddy, as I\nthought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and\nthere began to wonder in what part of the house it\u2014she\u2014my sister\u2014was.\nThe air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I\nlooked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible\nuntil one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum\ncake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and\nbiscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had\nnever seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.\nStanding at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook\nin a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately\nstuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my\nattention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing\nsherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, \"May I, dear sir?\" and\ndid. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent\nspeechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to \"follow,\" and\nwere all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into\nridiculous bundles.\n\"Which I meantersay, Pip,\" Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.\nTrabb called \"formed\" in the parlour, two and two,\u2014and it was\ndreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; \"which I\nmeantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the\nchurch myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it\nwith willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbours\nwould look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in\nrespect.\"\n\"Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!\" cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a\ndepressed business-like voice. \"Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are\nready!\"\nSo we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses\nwere bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and",

So, I walked a little further\nwith Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.\n\"I have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy.\"\n\"They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad\nstates\u2014though they had got better of late, rather than worse\u2014for four\ndays, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and\nsaid quite plainly, 'Joe.' As she had never said any word for a long\nwhile, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs\nto me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to\nput her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid\nher head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she\npresently said 'Joe' again, and once 'Pardon,' and once 'Pip.' And so\nshe never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later\nwhen we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.\"\nBiddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that\nwere coming out, were blurred in my own sight.\n\"Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"Do you know what is become of Orlick?\"\n\"I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in\nthe quarries.\"\n\"Of course you have seen him then?\u2014Why are you looking at that dark\ntree in the lane?\"\n\"I saw him there, on the night she died.\"\n\"That was not the last time either, Biddy?\"\n\"No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.\u2014It is of\nno use,\" said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running\nout, \"you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and\nhe is gone.\"\nIt revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by\nthis fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told\nher that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of\nthat country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she\ntold me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,\u2014she\ndidn't say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,\u2014but ever did\nhis duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a\ngentle heart.\n\"Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,\" said I; \"and Biddy,\nwe must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often\ndown here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.\"",

Don't say any\nmore, if you please, Biddy.

As often as I was restless in the\nnight, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an\nunkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.\nEarly in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and\nlooking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I\nstood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of\nhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright\nsun of the life in store for him were shining on it.\n\"Good-bye, dear Joe!\u2014No, don't wipe it off\u2014for God's sake, give me your\nblackened hand!\u2014I shall be down soon and often.\"\n[Illustration]\n\"Never too soon, sir,\" said Joe, \"and never too often, Pip!\"\nBiddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk\nand a crust of bread. \"Biddy,\" said I, when I gave her my hand at\nparting, \"I am not angry, but I am hurt.\"\n\"No, don't be hurt,\" she pleaded quite pathetically; \"let only me be\nhurt, if I have been ungenerous.\"\nOnce more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to\nme, as I suspect they did, that I should _not_ come back, and that\nBiddy was quite right, all I can say is,\u2014they were quite right too.",

Congratulations,\nMr. Pip.\"\nWe shook hands,\u2014he was always a remarkably short shaker,\u2014and I thanked\nhim.\n\"Take a chair, Mr. Pip,\" said my guardian.\nAs I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\nboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time\nwhen I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the\nshelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were\nmaking a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\n\"Now my young friend,\" my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\nbox, \"I am going to have a word or two with you.\"\n\"If you please, sir.\"\n\"What do you suppose,\" said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\nground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,\u2014\"what\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate of?\"\n\"At the rate of, sir?\"\n\"At,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\n\"the\u2014rate\u2014of?\" And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\npocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\nI had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\nany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\nI confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\nseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, \"I thought so!\" and blew his\nnose with an air of satisfaction.\n\"Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Have you anything to ask _me_?\"\n\"Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\nquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.\"\n\"Ask one,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?\"\n\"No. Ask another.\"\n\"Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?\"\n\"Waive that, a moment,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"and ask another.\"\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\nthe inquiry, \"Have-I\u2014anything to receive, sir?\" On that, Mr. Jaggers\nsaid, triumphantly, \"I thought we should come to it!\" and called to\nWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it\nin, and disappeared.\n\"Now, Mr. Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"attend, if you please. You have been\ndrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's\ncash-book; but you are in debt, of course?\"\n\"I am afraid I must say yes, sir.\"\n\"You know you must say yes; don't you?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"I don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did\nknow, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,\"\ncried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of\nprotesting: \"it's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but you\nwould. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\npiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\nand tell me what it is.\"\n\"This is a bank-note,\" said I, \"for five hundred pounds.\"\n\"That is a bank-note,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, \"for five hundred pounds.\nAnd a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?\"\n\"How could I do otherwise!\"\n\"Ah! But answer the question,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\"You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\nhandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\nday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\nsum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until\nthe donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your\nmoney affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from\nWemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are\nin communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\nagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\ninstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\nI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.\"\nI was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\nliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. \"I am\nnot paid, Pip,\" said he, coolly, \"to carry your words to any one;\" and\nthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\nhim.",

He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office\ncandlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near\nthe door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his\nhat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest\nwith his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.\n\"Mr. Wemmick,\" said I, \"I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\nto serve a friend.\"\nWemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\n\"This friend,\" I pursued, \"is trying to get on in commercial life, but\nhas no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\nbeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.\"\n\"With money down?\" said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\n\"With _some_ money down,\" I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot\nacross me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home\u2014\"with _some_\nmoney down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" said Wemmick, \"I should like just to run over with you on my\nfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as\nChelsea Reach. Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two;\nBlackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.\"\nHe had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\nsafe-key on the palm of his hand. \"There's as many as six, you see, to\nchoose from.\"\n\"I don't understand you,\" said I.\n\"Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,\" returned Wemmick, \"and take a walk upon\nyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\nof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\nyou may know the end of it too,\u2014but it's a less pleasant and profitable\nend.\"\nI could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\nsaying this.\n\"This is very discouraging,\" said I.\n\"Meant to be so,\" said Wemmick.\n\"Then is it your opinion,\" I inquired, with some little indignation,\n\"that a man should never\u2014\"\n\"\u2014Invest portable property in a friend?\" said Wemmick. \"Certainly he\nshould not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,\u2014and then it\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get\nrid of him.\"\n\"And that,\" said I, \"is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?\"\n\"That,\" he returned, \"is my deliberate opinion in this office.\"\n\"Ah!\" said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\nhere; \"but would that be your opinion at Walworth?\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" he replied, with gravity, \"Walworth is one place, and this\noffice is another.

He is very\nregular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my\nson.\"\nI nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside.\n\"You made acquaintance with my son, sir,\" said the old man, in his\nchirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, \"at his office, I\nexpect?\" I nodded. \"Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand\nat his business, sir?\" I nodded hard. \"Yes; so they tell me. His\nbusiness is the Law?\" I nodded harder. \"Which makes it more surprising\nin my son,\" said the old man, \"for he was not brought up to the Law,\nbut to the Wine-Coopering.\"\nCurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\nreputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\nsprightly manner, \"No, to be sure; you're right.\" And to this hour I\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\nhad made.\nAs I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\nsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his\nown calling in life had been \"the Wine-Coopering.\" By dint of straining\nthat term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on\nthe chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my\nmeaning understood.\n\"No,\" said the old gentleman; \"the warehousing, the warehousing. First,\nover yonder;\" he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\nintended to refer me to Liverpool; \"and then in the City of London\nhere. However, having an infirmity\u2014for I am hard of hearing, sir\u2014\"\nI expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\n\"\u2014Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\nwent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and\nlittle made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to\nwhat you said, you know,\" pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,\n\"what I say is, No to be sure; you're right.\"\nI was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\nimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\non one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\nwooden flap with \"JOHN\" upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\nwith great triumph, \"My son's come home!\" and we both went out to the\ndrawbridge.",

She might have been some two or\nthree years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed\nof portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both\nbefore and behind, made her figure very like a boy's kite; and I might\nhave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves\na little too intensely green.

Thinking that he\ndid this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I\nseized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\nHaving thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\nhad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\nbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\nwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert's home, and at his character, and\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\nthose, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\nconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\nhave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\nin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the\npossibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the\ncertainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any\nmean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told\nWemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a\ngreat affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some\nrays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience\nand knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my\nresources to help Herbert to some present income,\u2014say of a hundred a\nyear, to keep him in good hope and heart,\u2014and gradually to buy him on\nto some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to\nunderstand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert's\nknowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world\nwith whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his\nshoulder, and saying, \"I can't help confiding in you, though I know it\nmust be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever\nbrought me here.\"",

As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\nthem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\nquite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all\nexpressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\nresumed again.\nAs Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a\nshadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.\nWemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually\nstealing his arm round Miss Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw\nhis hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment\nMiss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm\nagain as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest\ndeliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins's composure\nwhile she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever\nseen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction\nof mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it\nmechanically.\nBy and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and\ngradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\nwiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\nenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\nof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\nof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\nit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading,\nWemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled\nto it by Miss Skiffins.",

So, I went out to\nWalworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by\nappointment in the City several times, but never held any communication\nwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that\nwe found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long\nestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted\ncapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a\npartner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which\nHerbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds\ndown, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at\ncertain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my\nproperty. Miss Skiffins's brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick\npervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.\nThe whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the\nleast suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the\nradiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a\nmighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the\nyoung merchant's name), and of Clarriker's having shown an\nextraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the\nopening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his\nface brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate\nfriend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of\ntriumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and\nhe having that day entered Clarriker's House, and he having talked to\nme for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really\ncry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations\nhad done some good to somebody.\nA great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my\nview. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all\nthe changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not",

I saw\nin this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her\nout to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with\nthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,\nand that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in\nthis that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even\nwhile the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my\nbeing staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's\ndeclining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.\nIn a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there\nbefore my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in\nthis, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which\nher life was hidden from the sun.\nThe candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on\nthe wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the\nsteady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I\nlooked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the\nstopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the\ntable and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly\nreflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I\nsaw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated\nand thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across\nthe landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it\nwere, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the\ncrawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as\nthey betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the\ngropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.\nIt happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose\nbetween Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever\nseen them opposed.\nWe were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham\nstill had Estella's arm drawn through her own, and still clutched\nEstella's hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.\nShe had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather\nendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.\n\"What!\" said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, \"are you tired\nof me?\"\n\"Only a little tired of myself,\" replied Estella, disengaging her arm,\nand moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at\nthe fire.\n\"Speak the truth, you ingrate!\" cried Miss Havisham, passionately\nstriking her stick upon the floor; \"you are tired of me.\"\nEstella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down at\nthe fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a\nself-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was\nalmost cruel.\n\"You stock and stone!\" exclaimed Miss Havisham. \"You cold, cold heart!\"",

Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as\nwell as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool\nthat is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up\ninto your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!\"\n\"Soon forgotten!\" moaned Miss Havisham. \"Times soon forgotten!\"\n\"No, not forgotten,\" retorted Estella,\u2014\"not forgotten, but treasured up\nin my memory.

When have you found me giving\nadmission here,\" she touched her bosom with her hand, \"to anything that\nyou excluded?

The success\nis not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.\"\nMiss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor,\namong the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took\nadvantage of the moment\u2014I had sought one from the first\u2014to leave the\nroom, after beseeching Estella's attention to her, with a movement of\nmy hand.

When I at last took courage to return to the room, I\nfound Estella sitting at Miss Havisham's knee, taking up some stitches\nin one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and\nof which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old\nbanners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella\nand I played at cards, as of yore,\u2014only we were skilful now, and played\nFrench games,\u2014and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.\nI lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first\ntime I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to\ncome near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this\nside of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind\nthe half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the\nroom overhead, in the room beneath,\u2014everywhere. At last, when the night\nwas slow to creep on towards two o'clock, I felt that I absolutely\ncould no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I\nmust get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out\nacross the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the\nouter courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no\nsooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss\nHavisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I\nfollowed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. She\ncarried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from\none of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by\nits light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed\nair of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard\nher walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again\ninto that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark\nboth to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some\nstreaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During\nthe whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I\nheard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless\nlow cry.",

I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me\nwhile the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost\nbetween us, that might easily be.

Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew\nwhere I was to be found.\nWhether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,\nafter this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The\ndebate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more\nhonourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they\nbelieved _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it was\ndecided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle\nwould bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that\nhe had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,\nas a gentleman and a Finch, for \"having been betrayed into a warmth\nwhich.\" Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honour\nshould take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a\npolite little avowal in Estella's hand, that she had had the honour of\ndancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret\nthat I had been \"betrayed into a warmth which,\" and on the whole to\nrepudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.\nDrummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the\nGrove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the\npromotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing\nrate.",

            "text": "I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot\nadequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should\nshow any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far\nbelow the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been\nreferable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my\nlove for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to\nthat hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had\nfavoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind\nand degree of distress.\nIt was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle\nhad begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A\nlittle while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed\none another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and\nEstella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement,\nnow almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him\nvery well, now scarcely remembering who he was.\nThe Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,\nhowever, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a\nblockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, which\nsometimes did him good service,\u2014almost taking the place of\nconcentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching\nEstella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil\nhimself and drop at the right nick of time.\nAt a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls\nat most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,\nthis blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration\non her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the\nnext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to\ntake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I\nwas with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such\nplaces.\n\"Are you tired, Estella?\"\n\"Rather, Pip.\"\n\"You should be.\"\n\"Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to\nwrite, before I go to sleep.\"\n\"Recounting to-night's triumph?\" said I. \"Surely a very poor one,\nEstella.\"\n\"What do you mean? I didn't know there had been any.\"\n\"Estella,\" said I, \"do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is\nlooking over here at us.\"\n\"Why should I look at him?\" returned Estella, with her eyes on me\ninstead. \"What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,\u2014to use\nyour words,\u2014that I need look at?\"\n\"Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,\" said I. \"For he\nhas been hovering about you all night.\"\n\"Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,\" replied Estella, with a\nglance towards him, \"hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help\nit?\"\n\"No,\" I returned; \"but cannot the Estella help it?\"\n\"Well!\" said she, laughing, after a moment, \"perhaps. Yes. Anything you\nlike.\"\n\"But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should\nencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is\ndespised.\"\n\"Well?\" said she.\n\"You know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,\nill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.\"\n\"Well?\" said she.\n\"You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\nroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?\"\n\"Well?\" said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her\nlovely eyes the wider.\nTo overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\nfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, \"Well! Then, that is\nwhy it makes me wretched.\"\nNow, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea\nof making me\u2014me\u2014wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;\nbut in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the\nquestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.\n\"Pip,\" said Estella, casting her glance over the room, \"don't be\nfoolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and\nmay be meant to have. It's not worth discussing.\"\n\"Yes it is,\" said I, \"because I cannot bear that people should say,\n'she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest\nin the crowd.'\"\n\"I can bear it,\" said Estella.\n\"Oh! don't be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.\"\n\"Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!\" said Estella, opening\nher hands. \"And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\nboor!\"\n\"There is no doubt you do,\" said I, something hurriedly, \"for I have\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never\ngive to\u2014me.\"\n\"Do you want me then,\" said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and\nserious, if not angry, look, \"to deceive and entrap you?\"\n\"Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?\"\n\"Yes, and many others,\u2014all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I'll\nsay no more.\"\nAnd now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled\nmy heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on\nunhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the\nevent that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world",

We lived at the top of the last house, and the\nwind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges\nof cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed\nagainst the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked,\nthat I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.\nOccasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it\ncould not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors\nopen and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out;\nand when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black\nwindows (opening them ever so little was out of the question in the\nteeth of such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were\nblown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were\nshuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being\ncarried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.\nI read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book at\neleven o'clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul's, and all the many\nchurch-clocks in the City\u2014some leading, some accompanying, some\nfollowing\u2014struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;\nand I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,\nwhen I heard a footstep on the stair.\nWhat nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the\nfootstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I\nlistened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.\nRemembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up\nmy reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had\nstopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.\n\"There is some one down there, is there not?\" I called out, looking\ndown.\n\"Yes,\" said a voice from the darkness beneath.\n\"What floor do you want?\"\n\"The top. Mr. Pip.\"\n\"That is my name.\u2014There is nothing the matter?\"\n\"Nothing the matter,\" returned the voice. And the man came on.\nI stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly\nwithin its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its\ncircle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere\ninstant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was\nstrange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched\nand pleased by the sight of me.\nMoving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially\ndressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-grey\nhair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong\non his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to\nweather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp\nincluded us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was\nholding out both his hands to me.\n\"Pray what is your business?\" I asked him.\n\"My business?\" he repeated, pausing. \"Ah! Yes. I will explain my\nbusiness, by your leave.\"\n\"Do you wish to come in?\"\n\"Yes,\" he replied; \"I wish to come in, master.\"\nI had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the\nsort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.\nI resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to\nrespond to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and,\nhaving set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to",

A diamond all set round with rubies; _that's_ a\ngentleman's, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at\nyour clothes; better ain't to be got! And your books too,\" turning his\neyes round the room, \"mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And\nyou read 'em; don't you? I see you'd been a reading of 'em when I come\nin. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read 'em to me, dear boy! And if they're in\nforeign languages wot I don't understand, I shall be just as proud as\nif I did.\"\nAgain he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood\nran cold within me.\n\"Don't you mind talking, Pip,\" said he, after again drawing his sleeve\nover his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I\nwell remembered,\u2014and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so\nmuch in earnest; \"you can't do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You\nain't looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn't prepared for\nthis as I wos. But didn't you never think it might be me?\"\n\"O no, no, no,\" I returned, \"Never, never!\"\n\"Well, you see it _wos_ me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but\nmy own self and Mr. Jaggers.\"\n\"Was there no one else?\" I asked.\n\"No,\" said he, with a glance of surprise: \"who else should there be?\nAnd, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There's bright eyes\nsomewheres\u2014eh? Isn't there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the\nthoughts on?\"\nO Estella, Estella!\n\"They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy 'em. Not that a\ngentleman like you, so well set up as you, can't win 'em off of his own\ngame; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,\ndear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money\nleft me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got\nmy liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I\nwent for you. 'Lord strike a blight upon it,' I says, wotever it was I\nwent for, 'if it ain't for him!' It all prospered wonderful. As I giv'\nyou to understand just now, I'm famous for it. It was the money left\nme, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr.\nJaggers\u2014all for you\u2014when he first come arter you, agreeable to my\nletter.\"\nO that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,\u2014far from\ncontented, yet, by comparison happy!\n\"And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look'ee here, to know\nin secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them\ncolonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I\nsay? I says to myself, 'I'm making a better gentleman nor ever _you_'ll\nbe!' When one of 'em says to another, 'He was a convict, a few year\nago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he's lucky,' what do\nI say? I says to myself, 'If I ain't a gentleman, nor yet ain't got no\nlearning, I'm the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which\non you owns a brought-up London gentleman?' This way I kep myself\na-going. And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for\ncertain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on\nhis own ground.\"\nHe laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for\nanything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.\n\"It warn't easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn't\nsafe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for\nI was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear\nboy, I done it!\"\nI tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had\nseemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;\neven now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though\nthose were loud and his was silent.\n\"Where will you put me?\" he asked, presently. \"I must be put\nsomewheres, dear boy.\"\n\"To sleep?\" said I.\n\"Yes. And to sleep long and sound,\" he answered; \"for I've been\nsea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.\"\n\"My friend and companion,\" said I, rising from the sofa, \"is absent;\nyou must have his room.\"\n\"He won't come back to-morrow; will he?\"\n\"No,\" said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost\nefforts; \"not to-morrow.\"\n\"Because, look'ee here, dear boy,\" he said, dropping his voice, and\nlaying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, \"caution is\nnecessary.\"\n\"How do you mean? Caution?\"\n\"By G\u2014\u2014, it's Death!\"\n\"What's death?\"\n\"I was sent for life. It's death to come back. There's been overmuch\ncoming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if\ntook.\"\nNothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched\nme with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to\ncome to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him\ninstead of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the\nstrongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with\nthe strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary,\nit would have been better, for his preservation would then have\nnaturally and tenderly addressed my heart.\nMy first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen\nfrom without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did\nso, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I\nsaw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal\nagain. It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to\nfile at his leg.\nWhen I had gone into Herbert's room, and had shut off any other\ncommunication between it and the staircase than through the room in\nwhich our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to\nbed? He said yes, but asked me for some of my \"gentleman's linen\" to\nput on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and\nmy blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me\ngood-night.\nI got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire\nin the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to\ngo to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it\nwas not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked\nI was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.\nMiss Havisham's intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not\ndesigned for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a\nsting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to\npractise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first\nsmarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,\u2014it was for the\nconvict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out\nof those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,",

            "text": "It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so\nfar as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought\npressing on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused\nconcourse at a distance.\nThe impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was\nself-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would\ninevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service\nnow, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by\nan animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room\nsecret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They\nboth had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically\nlooking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted;\nindeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get\nup a mystery with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning\nthat my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country.\nThis course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness\nfor the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,\nI was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there\nto come with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black\nstaircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouching\nin a corner.\nAs the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but\neluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman\nto come quickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind\nbeing as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the\nlantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we\nexamined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one\nthere. It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have\nslipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman's, and\nleaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including\nthe room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and\nassuredly no other man was in those chambers.\nIt troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on\nthat night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the\nchance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at\nthe door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had\nperceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the\nnight, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in\nthe Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man\nwho dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in\nthe country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the\nnight, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came\nupstairs.\n\"The night being so bad, sir,\" said the watchman, as he gave me back my\nglass, \"uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three\ngentlemen that I have named, I don't call to mind another since about\neleven o'clock, when a stranger asked for you.\"\n\"My uncle,\" I muttered. \"Yes.\"\n\"You saw him, sir?\"\n\"Yes. Oh yes.\"\n\"Likewise the person with him?\"\n\"Person with him!\" I repeated.\n\"I judged the person to be with him,\" returned the watchman. \"The\nperson stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person\ntook this way when he took this way.\"\n\"What sort of person?\"\nThe watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working\nperson; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-coloured kind of\nclothes on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the\nmatter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching\nweight to it.\nWhen I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without\nprolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two\ncircumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent\nsolution apart,\u2014as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home, who\nhad not gone near this watchman's gate, might have strayed to my\nstaircase and dropped asleep there,\u2014and my nameless visitor might have\nbrought some one with him to show him the way,\u2014still, joined, they had\nan ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a\nfew hours had made me.\nI lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of\nthe morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been\ndozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an\nhour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up\nuneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now,\nmaking thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into\na profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.\nAll this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor\ncould I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly\ndejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way. As\nto forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an\nelephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild\nmorning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I\nsat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to\nappear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long\nI had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or\neven who I was that made it.",

            "text": "\"What were you brought up to be?\"\n\"A warmint, dear boy.\"\nHe answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some\nprofession.\n\"When you came into the Temple last night\u2014\" said I, pausing to wonder\nwhether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long\nago.\n\"Yes, dear boy?\"\n\"When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had\nyou any one with you?\"\n\"With me? No, dear boy.\"\n\"But there was some one there?\"\n\"I didn't take particular notice,\" he said, dubiously, \"not knowing the\nways of the place. But I think there _was_ a person, too, come in\nalonger me.\"\n\"Are you known in London?\"\n\"I hope not!\" said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that\nmade me turn hot and sick.\n\"Were you known in London, once?\"\n\"Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.\"\n\"Were you\u2014tried\u2014in London?\"\n\"Which time?\" said he, with a sharp look.\n\"The last time.\"\nHe nodded. \"First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.\"\nIt was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up a\nknife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, \"And what I done is\nworked out and paid for!\" fell to at his breakfast.\nHe ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his\nactions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed\nhim since I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in\nhis mouth, and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to\nbear upon it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun\nwith any appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat\nmuch as I did,\u2014repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and\ngloomily looking at the cloth.\n\"I'm a heavy grubber, dear boy,\" he said, as a polite kind of apology\nwhen he made an end of his meal, \"but I always was. If it had been in\nmy constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha' got into lighter\ntrouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as\nshepherd t'other side the world, it's my belief I should ha' turned\ninto a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn't a had my smoke.\"\nAs he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the\nbreast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a\nhandful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having\nfilled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his\npocket were a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the\ntongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the\nhearth-rug with his back to the fire, and went through his favourite\naction of holding out both his hands for mine.\n\"And this,\" said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed\nat his pipe,\u2014\"and this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine\nOne! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip'late, is, to\nstand by and look at you, dear boy!\"\nI released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning\nslowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was\nchained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his\nhoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its\niron grey hair at the sides.\n\"I mustn't see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;\nthere mustn't be no mud on _his_ boots. My gentleman must have horses,\nPip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant to\nride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood\n'uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.\nWe'll show 'em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won't us?\"\nHe took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with\npapers, and tossed it on the table.\n\"There's something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It's\nyourn. All I've got ain't mine; it's yourn. Don't you be afeerd on it.\nThere's more where that come from. I've come to the old country fur to\nsee my gentleman spend his money _like_ a gentleman. That'll be _my_\npleasure. _My_ pleasure 'ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you\nall!\" he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once\nwith a loud snap, \"blast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to\nthe colonist a stirring up the dust, I'll show a better gentleman than\nthe whole kit on you put together!\"\n\"Stop!\" said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, \"I want to\nspeak to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you\nare to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what\nprojects you have.\"\n\"Look'ee here, Pip,\" said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly\naltered and subdued manner; \"first of all, look'ee here. I forgot\nmyself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that's what it was; low.\nLook'ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain't a-going to be low.\"\n\"First,\" I resumed, half groaning, \"what precautions can be taken\nagainst your being recognised and seized?\"\n\"No, dear boy,\" he said, in the same tone as before, \"that don't go\nfirst. Lowness goes first. I ain't took so many year to make a\ngentleman, not without knowing what's due to him. Look'ee here, Pip. I\nwas low; that's what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.\"\nSome sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I\nreplied, \"I _have_ looked over it. In Heaven's name, don't harp upon\nit!\"\n\"Yes, but look'ee here,\" he persisted. \"Dear boy, I ain't come so fur,\nnot fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying\u2014\"\n\"How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?\"\n\"Well, dear boy, the danger ain't so great. Without I was informed\nagen, the danger ain't so much to signify. There's Jaggers, and there's\nWemmick, and there's you. Who else is there to inform?\"\n\"Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?\" said\nI.\n\"Well,\" he returned, \"there ain't many. Nor yet I don't intend to\nadvertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from\nBotany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who's to gain by it? Still,\nlook'ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I\nshould ha' come to see you, mind you, just the same.\"\n\"And how long do you remain?\"\n\"How long?\" said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping\nhis jaw as he stared at me. \"I'm not a-going back. I've come for good.\"\n\"Where are you to live?\" said I. \"What is to be done with you? Where\nwill you be safe?\"\n\"Dear boy,\" he returned, \"there's disguising wigs can be bought for\nmoney, and there's hair powder, and spectacles, and black\nclothes,\u2014shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what\nothers has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of\nliving, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.\"",

What\nthen, when that's once done? Here I am. To go back now 'ud be as bad as\nto stand ground\u2014worse. Besides, Pip, I'm here, because I've meant it by\nyou, years and years.

And now let me have a look at my\ngentleman agen.\"\nOnce more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of\nadmiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.\nIt appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet\nlodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert\nreturned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must be\nconfided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I\ncould have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with\nhim out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so\nplain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved\nhis consent to Herbert's participation until he should have seen him\nand formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy. \"And even then,\ndear boy,\" said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out\nof his pocket, \"we'll have him on his oath.\"\nTo state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about\nthe world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to\nstate what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never\nknew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of\nhaving been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his\nknowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that\nwise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or\ncharm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he\nhad made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had\ndescribed himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in\nhis solitude.\nAs he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he\nlooked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next\ndiscussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an\nextraordinary belief in the virtues of \"shorts\" as a disguise, and had\nin his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him\nsomething between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable\ndifficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a\nprosperous farmer's; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,\nand wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the\nlaundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until\nhis change of dress was made.",

I also communicated to him\nanother caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his\nletter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I\ncautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all\nlikely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his\nnatural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be\nan act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the\nlaw. I gave Magwitch that caution,\" said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at\nme; \"I wrote it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.\"\n\"No doubt,\" said I.\n\"I have been informed by Wemmick,\" pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking\nhard at me, \"that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from\na colonist of the name of Purvis, or\u2014\"\n\"Or Provis,\" I suggested.\n\"Or Provis\u2014thank you, Pip. Perhaps it _is_ Provis? Perhaps you know\nit's Provis?\"\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\"You know it's Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist\nof the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on\nbehalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by\nreturn of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received\nthe explanation of Magwitch\u2014in New South Wales?\"\n\"It came through Provis,\" I replied.\n\"Good day, Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; \"glad to have\nseen you. In writing by post to Magwitch\u2014in New South Wales\u2014or in\ncommunicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention\nthat the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to\nyou, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.\nGood-day, Pip!\"\nWe shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I\nturned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two\nvile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,\nand to force out of their swollen throats, \"O, what a man he is!\"",

I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must\nhave been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my\u2014Halloa! I\nbeg your pardon.\"\nHe was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by\nseeing Provis.

This is\u2014a visitor of mine.\"\n\"It's all right, dear boy!\" said Provis coming forward, with his little\nclasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. \"Take it in\nyour right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in\nany way sumever! Kiss it!\"\n\"Do so, as he wishes it,\" I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at me\nwith a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis\nimmediately shaking hands with him, said, \"Now you're on your oath, you\nknow. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan't make a gentleman on\nyou!\"",

When he had spoken some sound\nwords of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the\nquestion, What was to be done?\nThe chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had\nstood,\u2014for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in\none unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with\nhis pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,\nand what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,\u2014I say his\nchair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but\nnext moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had\nno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\npatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that\nconfidence without shaping a syllable.\n\"What,\" said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,\u2014\"what is\nto be done?\"\n\"My poor dear Handel,\" he replied, holding his head, \"I am too stunned\nto think.\"\n\"So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be\ndone. He is intent upon various new expenses,\u2014horses, and carriages,\nand lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.\"\n\"You mean that you can't accept\u2014\"\n\"How can I?\" I interposed, as Herbert paused. \"Think of him! Look at\nhim!\"\nAn involuntary shudder passed over both of us.\n\"Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to\nme, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!\"\n\"My poor dear Handel,\" Herbert repeated.\n\"Then,\" said I, \"after all, stopping short here, never taking another\npenny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily\nin debt,\u2014very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,\u2014and I have\nbeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.\"\n\"Well, well, well!\" Herbert remonstrated. \"Don't say fit for nothing.\"\n\"What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that\nis, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but\nfor the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.\"\nOf course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a\nwarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.\n\"Anyhow, my dear Handel,\" said he presently, \"soldiering won't do. If\nyou were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose you\nwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have\nalready had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!\nBesides, it's absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker's\nhouse, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you\nknow.\"\nPoor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.\n\"But there is another question,\" said Herbert. \"This is an ignorant,\ndetermined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he\nseems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce\ncharacter.\"\n\"I know he is,\" I returned. \"Let me tell you what evidence I have seen\nof it.\" And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of\nthat encounter with the other convict.\n\"See, then,\" said Herbert; \"think of this! He comes here at the peril\nof his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea. In the moment of\nrealisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from\nunder his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.\nDo you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?\"\n\"I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night\nof his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\nputting himself in the way of being taken.\"\n\"Then you may rely upon it,\" said Herbert, \"that there would be great\ndanger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he\nremains in England, and that would be his reckless course if you\nforsook him.\"\nI was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me\nfrom the first, and the working out of which would make me regard\nmyself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my\nchair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that\neven if Provis were recognised and taken, in spite of himself, I should\nbe wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so\nwretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would\nfar rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I\nwould ever have come to this!\nBut there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?\n\"The first and the main thing to be done,\" said Herbert, \"is to get him\nout of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be\ninduced to go.\"\n\"But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?\"\n\"My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next\nstreet, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to\nhim and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get\nhim away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything\nelse in his life, now.\"\n\"There, again!\" said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands\nheld out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. \"I know\nnothing of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night\nand see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes,\nand yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified\nme two days in my childhood!\"\nHerbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and\nfro together, studying the carpet.\n\"Handel,\" said Herbert, stopping, \"you feel convinced that you can take\nno further benefits from him; do you?\"\n\"Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?\"\n\"And you feel convinced that you must break with him?\"\n\"Herbert, can you ask me?\"\n\"And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he\nhas risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from\nthrowing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir\na finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in\nHeaven's name, and we'll see it out together, dear old boy.\"\nIt was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,\nwith only that done.",

Summun had\nrun away from me\u2014a man\u2014a tinker\u2014and he'd took the fire with him, and\nleft me wery cold.\n\"I know'd my name to be Magwitch, chrisen'd Abel. How did I know it?\nMuch as I know'd the birds' names in the hedges to be chaffinch,\nsparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as\nthe birds' names come out true, I supposed mine did.\n\"So fur as I could find, there warn't a soul that see young Abel\nMagwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at\nhim, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up,\ntook up, to that extent that I reg'larly grow'd up took up.\n\"This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as\nmuch to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for\nthere warn't many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the\nname of being hardened. 'This is a terrible hardened one,' they says to\nprison wisitors, picking out me. 'May be said to live in jails, this\nboy.' Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured\nmy head, some on 'em,\u2014they had better a measured my stomach,\u2014and others\non 'em giv me tracts what I couldn't read, and made me speeches what I\ncouldn't understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But\nwhat the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach,\nmustn't I?\u2014Howsomever, I'm a getting low, and I know what's due. Dear\nboy and Pip's comrade, don't you be afeerd of me being low.\n\"Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,\u2014though\nthat warn't as often as you may think, till you put the question\nwhether you would ha' been over-ready to give me work yourselves,\u2014a bit\nof a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a\nhaymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don't pay and\nlead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a\nTraveller's Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs,\nlearnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a\npenny a time learnt me to write. I warn't locked up as often now as\nformerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.\n\"At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted\nwi' a man whose skull I'd crack wi' this poker, like the claw of a\nlobster, if I'd got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and\nthat's the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch,\naccording to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last\nnight.\n\"He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he'd been to a public\nboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was\na dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the\nnight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth\nthat I know'd on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when\nI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a\nsporting one) called him out, and said, 'I think this is a man that\nmight suit you,'\u2014meaning I was.\n\"Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a\nwatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of\nclothes.\n\"'To judge from appearances, you're out of luck,' says Compeyson to me.\n\"'Yes, master, and I've never been in it much.' (I had come out of\nKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have\nbeen for something else; but it warn't.)\n\"'Luck changes,' says Compeyson; 'perhaps yours is going to change.'\n\"I says, 'I hope it may be so. There's room.'\n\"'What can you do?' says Compeyson.\n\"'Eat and drink,' I says; 'if you'll find the materials.'\n\"Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five\nshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\n\"I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on\nto be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson's business in which\nwe was to go pardners? Compeyson's business was the swindling,\nhandwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts\nof traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs\nout of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was\nCompeyson's business. He'd no more heart than a iron file, he was as\ncold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.\n\"There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,\u2014not as\nbeing so chrisen'd, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a\nshadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a\nrich lady some years afore, and they'd made a pot of money by it; but\nCompeyson betted and gamed, and he'd have run through the king's taxes.\nSo, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,\nand Compeyson's wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity\non him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and\nnobody.\n\"I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn't; and I won't pretend I\nwas partick'ler\u2014for where 'ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?\nSo I begun wi' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur\nlived at the top of Compeyson's house (over nigh Brentford it was), and\nCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in\ncase he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled\nthe account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a\ntearing down into Compeyson's parlour late at night, in only a flannel\ngown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson's wife,\n'Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can't get rid of\nher. She's all in white,' he says, 'wi' white flowers in her hair, and\nshe's awful mad, and she's got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she\nsays she'll put it on me at five in the morning.'\n\"Says Compeyson: 'Why, you fool, don't you know she's got a living\nbody? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door,\nor in at the window, and up the stairs?'\n\"'I don't know how she's there,' says Arthur, shivering dreadful with\nthe horrors, 'but she's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,\nawful mad. And over where her heart's broke\u2014_you_ broke it!\u2014there's\ndrops of blood.'\n\"Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. 'Go up alonger this\ndrivelling sick man,' he says to his wife, 'and Magwitch, lend her a\nhand, will you?' But he never come nigh himself.\n\"Compeyson's wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most\ndreadful. 'Why look at her!' he cries out. 'She's a shaking the shroud\nat me! Don't you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain't it awful to see her\nso mad?' Next he cries, 'She'll put it on me, and then I'm done for!\nTake it away from her, take it away!' And then he catched hold of us,\nand kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed\nI see her myself.\n\"Compeyson's wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the\nhorrors off, and by and by he quieted. 'O, she's gone! Has her keeper\nbeen for her?' he says. 'Yes,' says Compeyson's wife. 'Did you tell him\nto lock her and bar her in?' 'Yes.' 'And to take that ugly thing away\nfrom her?' 'Yes, yes, all right.' 'You're a good creetur,' he says,\n'don't leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!'\n\"He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and\nthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, 'Here she is! She's\ngot the shroud again. She's unfolding it. She's coming out of the\ncorner. She's coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you\u2014one of each\nside\u2014don't let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.\nDon't let her throw it over my shoulders. Don't let her lift me up to\nget it round me. She's lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he lifted\nhimself up hard, and was dead.\n\"Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and me\nwas soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own\nbook,\u2014this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade\non.\n\"Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done\u2014which 'ud\ntake a week\u2014I'll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip's comrade, that\nthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always\nin debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a\ngetting into danger. He was younger than me, but he'd got craft, and\nhe'd got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no\nmercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi'\u2014Stop though! I ain't\nbrought _her_ in\u2014\"",

Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for\nmisdemeanor, while with Compeyson?\"\nI answered, No.\n\"Well!\" he said, \"I _was_, and got convicted. As to took up on\nsuspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that\nit lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both\ncommitted for felony,\u2014on a charge of putting stolen notes in\ncirculation,\u2014and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me,\n'Separate defences, no communication,' and that was all. And I was so\nmiserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on\nmy back, afore I could get Jaggers.\n\"When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman\nCompeyson looked, wi' his curly hair and his black clothes and his\nwhite pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.\nWhen the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand,\nI noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the\nevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had\ncome for'ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the\nmoney had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work\nthe thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see\nthe plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, 'My lord and\ngentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your\neyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be\nspoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to\nas such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here\ntransactions, and only suspected; t'other, the elder, always seen in\n'em and always wi' his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is\nbut one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is\nmuch the worst one?' And such-like. And when it come to character,\nwarn't it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn't it his\nschoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn't it him as\nhad been know'd by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to\nhis disadvantage? And warn't it me as had been tried afore, and as had\nbeen know'd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when\nit come to speech-making, warn't it Compeyson as could speak to 'em wi'\nhis face dropping every now and then into his white\npocket-handkercher,\u2014ah! and wi' verses in his speech, too,\u2014and warn't\nit me as could only say, 'Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most\nprecious rascal'? And when the verdict come, warn't it Compeyson as was\nrecommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and\ngiving up all the information he could agen me, and warn't it me as got\nnever a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, 'Once out of\nthis court, I'll smash that face of yourn!' ain't it Compeyson as prays\nthe Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And\nwhen we're sentenced, ain't it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,\nand ain't it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so\nwell, and ain't it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of\nwiolent passion, likely to come to worse?\"\nHe had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked\nit, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching\nout his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, \"I ain't a-going\nto be low, dear boy!\"\nHe had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped\nhis face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.\n[Illustration]\n\"I had said to Compeyson that I'd smash that face of his, and I swore\nLord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I\ncouldn't get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him\nand hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at\nhim, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn't a\nstrong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I\nescaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there,\nenvying them as was in 'em and all over, when I first see my boy!\"\nHe regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent\nto me again, though I had felt great pity for him.\n\"By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them\nmarshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to\nget quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him\ndown. I smashed his face. 'And now,' says I 'as the worst thing I can\ndo, caring nothing for myself, I'll drag you back.' And I'd have swum\noff, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I'd a got him\naboard without the soldiers.\n\"Of course he'd much the best of it to the last,\u2014his character was so\ngood. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous\nintentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought\nto trial again, and sent for life. I didn't stop for life, dear boy and\nPip's comrade, being here.\"",

When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly\nride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,\nto look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!\nAs he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a\nvery lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into\nthe coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I\nordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very\nwell knew why he had come there.\nPretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had\nnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of\ncoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which\nit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly\nirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\nfire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my\nhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to\nstir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.\n\"Is this a cut?\" said Mr. Drummle.\n\"Oh!\" said I, poker in hand; \"it's you, is it? How do you do? I was\nwondering who it was, who kept the fire off.\"\nWith that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself\nside by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the\nfire.\n\"You have just come down?\" said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away\nwith his shoulder.\n\"Yes,\" said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.\n\"Beastly place,\" said Drummle. \"Your part of the country, I think?\"\n\"Yes,\" I assented. \"I am told it's very like your Shropshire.\"\n\"Not in the least like it,\" said Drummle.\nHere Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.\nDrummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.\n\"Have you been here long?\" I asked, determined not to yield an inch of\nthe fire.\n\"Long enough to be tired of it,\" returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,\nbut equally determined.\n\"Do you stay here long?\"\n\"Can't say,\" answered Mr. Drummle. \"Do you?\"\n\"Can't say,\" said I.\nI felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle's\nshoulder had claimed another hair's breadth of room, I should have\njerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged\na similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.\nHe whistled a little. So did I.\n\"Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?\" said Drummle.\n\"Yes. What of that?\" said I.\nMr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, \"Oh!\"\nand laughed.\n\"Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?\"\n\"No,\" said he, \"not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the\nsaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way\nvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses\u2014and\nsmithies\u2014and that. Waiter!\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Is that horse of mine ready?\"\n\"Brought round to the door, sir.\"\n\"I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won't ride to-day; the weather\nwon't do.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\"And I don't dine, because I'm going to dine at the lady's.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\nThen, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\ngreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\nexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\nrobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\nhim on the fire.\nOne thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\ncame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\nsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\nhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\nthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle's\nwas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\nstood our ground.\n\"Have you been to the Grove since?\" said Drummle.\n\"No,\" said I, \"I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was\nthere.\"\n\"Was that when we had a difference of opinion?\"\n\"Yes,\" I replied, very shortly.\n\"Come, come! They let you off easily enough,\" sneered Drummle. \"You\nshouldn't have lost your temper.\"\n\"Mr. Drummle,\" said I, \"you are not competent to give advice on that\nsubject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that\noccasion), I don't throw glasses.\"\n\"I do,\" said Drummle.\nAfter glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of\nsmouldering ferocity, I said,\u2014\n\"Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don't think it an\nagreeable one.\"\n\"I am sure it's not,\" said he, superciliously over his shoulder; \"I\ndon't think anything about it.\"\n\"And therefore,\" I went on, \"with your leave, I will suggest that we\nhold no kind of communication in future.\"\n\"Quite my opinion,\" said Drummle, \"and what I should have suggested\nmyself, or done\u2014more likely\u2014without suggesting. But don't lose your\ntemper. Haven't you lost enough without that?\"\n\"What do you mean, sir?\"\n\"Waiter!\" said Drummle, by way of answering me.\nThe waiter reappeared.\n\"Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don't\nride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady's?\"\n\"Quite so, sir!\"\nWhen the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his\nhand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,\ncareful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket\nand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and\nboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without\nintroducing Estella's name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;\nand therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were\nno one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have\nremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for\nthe incursion of three thriving farmers\u2014laid on by the waiter, I\nthink\u2014who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and\nrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we\nwere obliged to give way.\nI saw him through the window, seizing his horse's mane, and mounting in\nhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought\nhe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in\nhis mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-coloured dress\nappeared with what was wanted,\u2014I could not have said from where:\nwhether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,\u2014and as Drummle\nleaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a\njerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching\nshoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me\nreminded me of Orlick.\nToo heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\nno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the\njourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house",

            "text": "In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles\nburnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham\nseated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.\nEstella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both\nraised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I\nderived that, from the look they interchanged.\n\"And what wind,\" said Miss Havisham, \"blows you here, Pip?\"\nThough she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.\nEstella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and\nthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as\nplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived\nI had discovered my real benefactor.\n\"Miss Havisham,\" said I, \"I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to\nEstella; and finding that some wind had blown _her_ here, I followed.\"\nMiss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,\nI took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her\noccupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural\nplace for me, that day.\n\"What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,\npresently\u2014in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not\ndisplease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.\"\nMiss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the\naction of Estella's fingers as they worked that she attended to what I\nsaid; but she did not look up.\n\"I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,\nand is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,\nanything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not\nmy secret, but another's.\"\nAs I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to\ngo on, Miss Havisham repeated, \"It is not your secret, but another's.\nWell?\"\n\"When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I\nbelonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I\nsuppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have\ncome,\u2014as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid\nfor it?\"\n\"Ay, Pip,\" replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; \"you did.\"\n\"And that Mr. Jaggers\u2014\"\n\"Mr. Jaggers,\" said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, \"had\nnothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and\nhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same\nrelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that\nas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.\"\nAny one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\nsuppression or evasion so far.\n\"But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least\nyou led me on?\" said I.\n\"Yes,\" she returned, again nodding steadily, \"I let you go on.\"\n\"Was that kind?\"\n\"Who am I,\" cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and\nflashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in\nsurprise,\u2014\"who am I, for God's sake, that I should be kind?\"\nIt was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I\ntold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.\n\"Well, well, well!\" she said. \"What else?\"\n\"I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,\" I said, to soothe\nher, \"in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for\nmy own information. What follows has another (and I hope more\ndisinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you\npunished\u2014practised on\u2014perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\nyour intention, without offence\u2014your self-seeking relations?\"\n\"I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my\nhistory, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\nnot to have it so! You made your own snares. _I_ never made them.\"\nWaiting until she was quiet again,\u2014for this, too, flashed out of her in\na wild and sudden way,\u2014I went on.\n\"I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,\nand have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them\nto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be\nfalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you\nor no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that\nyou deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you\nsuppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and\nincapable of anything designing or mean.\"\n\"They are your friends,\" said Miss Havisham.\n\"They made themselves my friends,\" said I, \"when they supposed me to\nhave superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and\nMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.\"\nThis contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do\nthem good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and\nthen said quietly,\u2014\n\"What do you want for them?\"\n\"Only,\" said I, \"that you would not confound them with the others. They\nmay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same\nnature.\"\nStill looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,\u2014\n\"What do you want for them?\"\n\"I am not so cunning, you see,\" I said, in answer, conscious that I\nreddened a little, \"as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,\nthat I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money\nto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the\nnature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you\nhow.\"\n\"Why must it be done without his knowledge?\" she asked, settling her\nhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.\n\"Because,\" said I, \"I began the service myself, more than two years\nago, without his knowledge, and I don't want to be betrayed. Why I fail\nin my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the\nsecret which is another person's and not mine.\"\nShe gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.\nAfter watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of\nthe slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the\ncollapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again\u2014at\nfirst, vacantly\u2014then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All\nthis time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her\nattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in\nour dialogue,\u2014\n\"What else?\"\n\"Estella,\" said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my\ntrembling voice, \"you know I love you. You know that I have loved you\nlong and dearly.\"\nShe raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her\nfingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved\ncountenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from\nher to me.\n\"I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me\nto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought\nyou could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.\nBut I must say it now.\"\nPreserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,\nEstella shook her head.\n\"I know,\" said I, in answer to that action,\u2014\"I know. I have no hope\nthat I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become\nof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love\nyou. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.\"\nLooking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook\nher head again.\n\"It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise\non the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all\nthese years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected\non the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that,\nin the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.\"\nI saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\nsat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\n\"It seems,\" said Estella, very calmly, \"that there are sentiments,\nfancies,\u2014I don't know how to call them,\u2014which I am not able to\ncomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\nof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\nnothing there. I don't care for what you say at all. I have tried to\nwarn you of this; now, have I not?\"\nI said in a miserable manner, \"Yes.\"\n\"Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.\nNow, did you not think so?\"\n\"I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and\nbeautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.\"\n\"It is in _my_ nature,\" she returned. And then she added, with a stress\nupon the words, \"It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\ndifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can\ndo no more.\"\n\"Is it not true,\" said I, \"that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\npursuing you?\"\n\"It is quite true,\" she replied, referring to him with the indifference\nof utter contempt.\n\"That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\nyou this very day?\"\nShe seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\n\"Quite true.\"\n\"You cannot love him, Estella!\"\nHer fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\n\"What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do\nnot mean what I say?\"\n\"You would never marry him, Estella?\"\nShe looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\nwork in her hands. Then she said, \"Why not tell you the truth? I am\ngoing to be married to him.\"\nI dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\nthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\nher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\nghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my\npassionate hurry and grief.\n\"Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\nfatal step. Put me aside for ever,\u2014you have done so, I well know,\u2014but\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\ngives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\nto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\nlove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as\ndearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can\nbear it better, for your sake!\"\nMy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\nbeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\nintelligible to her own mind.\n\"I am going,\" she said again, in a gentler voice, \"to be married to\nhim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\nmarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\nadoption? It is my own act.\"\n\"Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?\"\n\"On whom should I fling myself away?\" she retorted, with a smile.\n\"Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\npeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\ndone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading me\ninto what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\nwait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\nhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say\nno more. We shall never understand each other.\"\n\"Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!\" I urged, in despair.\n\"Don't be afraid of my being a blessing to him,\" said Estella; \"I shall\nnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\nboy\u2014or man?\"\n\"O Estella!\" I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\nwhat I would to restrain them; \"even if I remained in England and could\nhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle's wife?\"\n\"Nonsense,\" she returned,\u2014\"nonsense. This will pass in no time.\"\n\"Never, Estella!\"\n\"You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.\"\n\"Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\nhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\nin every prospect I have ever seen since,\u2014on the river, on the sails of\nthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the\ndarkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You\nhave been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever\nbecome acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London\nbuildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be\ndisplaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to\nme, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my\nlife, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the\nlittle good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I\nassociate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to\nthat always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me\nfeel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!\"\nIn what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself,\nI don't know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an\ninward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering\nmoments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,\u2014and soon\nafterwards with stronger reason,\u2014that while Estella looked at me merely\nwith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand\nstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of\npity and remorse.",

For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and\nthen struck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time\ncome to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the\ninn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach\nand be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as\ntire myself out.\nIt was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow\nintricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the\nMiddlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was\nclose by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till\nto-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could\nget to bed myself without disturbing him.\nAs it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the\nTemple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it\nill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held\nthe gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I\nmentioned my name.\n\"I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here's a note, sir. The\nmessenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my\nlantern?\"\n[Illustration]\nMuch surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to\nPhilip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the\nwords, \"PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.\" I opened it, the watchman holding up\nhis light, and read inside, in Wemmick's writing,\u2014\n\"DON'T GO HOME.\"",

There was an\ninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I\nlooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a\nnumber of blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the\nmarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying\nby for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever\ntumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,\u2014a\ndisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable\napproaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\naudible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little\nwashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the\nchest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired\na new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw\nwritten, DON'T GO HOME.\nWhatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never\nwarded off this DON'T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I\nthought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had\nread in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums\nin the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had\nbeen found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that\nhe must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to\nassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door\nto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship\nof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But\nall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\nand when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\nquestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I\nthought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I\nrecalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and\ntones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,\u2014even then I was\npursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don't go home.\nWhen at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a\nvast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present\ntense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do\nnot ye or you go home, let not them go home.

Which gate did you come\nto?\"\nI told him.\n\"I'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the\nnotes,\" said Wemmick; \"it's a good rule never to leave documentary\nevidence if you can help it, because you don't know when it may be put\nin. I'm going to take a liberty with you. _Would_ you mind toasting\nthis sausage for the Aged P.?\"\nI said I should be delighted to do it.\n\"Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,\" said Wemmick to the\nlittle servant; \"which leaves us to ourselves, don't you see, Mr. Pip?\"\nhe added, winking, as she disappeared.\nI thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse\nproceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged's sausage and he\nbuttered the crumb of the Aged's roll.\n\"Now, Mr. Pip, you know,\" said Wemmick, \"you and I understand one\nanother. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have\nbeen engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official\nsentiments are one thing. We are extra official.\"\nI cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted\nthe Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.\n\"I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,\" said Wemmick, \"being in a\ncertain place where I once took you,\u2014even between you and me, it's as\nwell not to mention names when avoidable\u2014\"\n\"Much better not,\" said I. \"I understand you.\"\n\"I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,\" said Wemmick, \"that a\ncertain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not\nunpossessed of portable property,\u2014I don't know who it may really be,\u2014we\nwon't name this person\u2014\"\n\"Not necessary,\" said I.\n\"\u2014Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good\nmany people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,\nand not quite irrespective of the government expense\u2014\"\nIn watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged's sausage,\nand greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick's; for which\nI apologised.\n\"\u2014By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of\nthereabouts. From which,\" said Wemmick, \"conjectures had been raised\nand theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden\nCourt, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.\"\n\"By whom?\" said I.\n\"I wouldn't go into that,\" said Wemmick, evasively, \"it might clash\nwith official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard\nother curious things in the same place. I don't tell it you on\ninformation received. I heard it.\"\nHe took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set\nforth the Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing\nit before him, he went into the Aged's room with a clean white cloth,\nand tied the same under the old gentleman's chin, and propped him up,\nand put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then\nhe placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, \"All\nright, ain't you, Aged P.?\" To which the cheerful Aged replied, \"All\nright, John, my boy, all right!\" As there seemed to be a tacit\nunderstanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was\ntherefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in\ncomplete ignorance of these proceedings.\n\"This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to\nsuspect),\" I said to Wemmick when he came back, \"is inseparable from\nthe person to whom you have adverted; is it?\"\nWemmick looked very serious. \"I couldn't undertake to say that, of my\nown knowledge. I mean, I couldn't undertake to say it was at first. But\nit either is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being.\"\nAs I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying\nas much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out\nof his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I\ntold him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to\nask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\ndeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\nbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\nnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\nonce, to put my question.\n\"You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\nCompeyson?\"\nHe answered with one other nod.\n\"Is he living?\"\nOne other nod.\n\"Is he in London?\"\nHe gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\nme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\n\"Now,\" said Wemmick, \"questioning being over,\" which he emphasised and\nrepeated for my guidance, \"I come to what I did, after hearing what I\nheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\nClarriker's to find Mr. Herbert.\"\n\"And him you found?\" said I, with great anxiety.\n\"And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\ndetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody\u2014Tom,\nJack, or Richard\u2014being about the chambers, or about the immediate\nneighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\nwhile you were out of the way.\"\n\"He would be greatly puzzled what to do?\"\n\"He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my\nopinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too\nfar out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under\nexisting circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you\nare once in it. Don't break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things\nslacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.\"\nI thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had\ndone?\n\"Mr. Herbert,\" said Wemmick, \"after being all of a heap for half an\nhour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\ncourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\nPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\nbow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\nare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?\"\n\"Not personally,\" said I.\nThe truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\nwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\npresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such very\nmoderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the\nstate of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time\nbefore I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert's\nprospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful\nphilosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not\nbeen very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;\nand thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara's esteem,\nand although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged\nmessages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I\ndid not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.\n\"The house with the bow-window,\" said Wemmick, \"being by the\nriver-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and\nbeing kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished\nupper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that\nas a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very\nwell of it, for three reasons I'll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.\nIt's altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual\nheap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near it\nyourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,\nthrough Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might be\nprudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a\nforeign packet-boat, there he is\u2014ready.\"\nMuch comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\nagain, and begged him to proceed.\n\"Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,\nand by nine o'clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or\nRichard,\u2014whichever it may be,\u2014you and I don't want to know,\u2014quite\nsuccessfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was\nsummoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and\ncornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that\nit was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself\nabout your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off\nand quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;\nand for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last\nnight, you should not go home. It brings in more confusion, and you\nwant confusion.\"",

Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his\nfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick's judgment\nand sources of information?\n\"Ay, ay, dear boy!\" he answered, with a grave nod, \"Jaggers knows.\"\n\"Then, I have talked with Wemmick,\" said I, \"and have come to tell you\nwhat caution he gave me and what advice.\"\nThis I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told\nhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or\nprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that\nmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping\nclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had\nsaid about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time\ncame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might\nbe safest in Wemmick's judgment. What was to follow that I did not\ntouch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it\nin my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in\ndeclared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by\nenlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled\nand difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it\nwere no worse?\nHe could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\ncoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\nventure. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had\nvery little fear of his safety with such good help.\nHerbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that\nsomething had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick's\nsuggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. \"We are both good\nwatermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the\nright time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no\nboatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance\nis worth saving. Never mind the season; don't you think it might be a\ngood thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs,\nand were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into\nthat habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,\nand there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or\nfifty-first.\"\nI liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed that\nit should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never\nrecognise us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank.",

The\nwindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark\nand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the\nfountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between\nme and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedside\nwhen he came in,\u2014for I went straight to bed, dispirited and\nfatigued,\u2014made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,\nhe looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as\nsolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.\nNext day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat\nwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her\nwithin a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and\npractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in\ncold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\nout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\nhours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\nLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But\nI knew well enough how to 'shoot' the bridge after seeing it done, and\nso began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to\nErith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were\npulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the\nblind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less\nfrequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single\nword of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there\nwas cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being\nwatched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning\npersons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.\nIn short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in\nhiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to\nstand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,\nand to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards\nClara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,\nand that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going\nswiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.",

If I had never known him out of Little Britain,\nand had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at\nthe Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him\nas I did.\nMy worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed\nfor money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the\nwant of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve\nit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But\nI had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more\nmoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and\nplans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,\nto hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction\u2014whether\nit was a false kind or a true, I hardly know\u2014in not having profited by\nhis generosity since his revelation of himself.\nAs the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella\nwas married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a\nconviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had\nconfided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her\nto me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of\nhope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you\nwho read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own\nlast year, last month, last week?\nIt was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,\ntowering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a\nrange of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause\nfor fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror\nfresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would\nwith dread, for Herbert's returning step at night, lest it should be\nfleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,\u2014for all that, and\nmuch more to like purpose, the round of things went on.

He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in\nthe cloth, and on that property married a young person in\nbed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of\nPortsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach\nto rub their own hands and shake everybody else's, and sing \"Fill,\nfill!\" A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn't fill, or\ndo anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly\nstated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed\nto two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so\neffectually done (the Swab family having considerable political\ninfluence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then\nit was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white\nhat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a\ngridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down\nfrom behind with the gridiron whom he couldn't confute with what he had\noverheard. This led to Mr. Wopsle's (who had never been heard of\nbefore) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of\ngreat power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all\nto go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down\nthe Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. The\nboatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on\nthe Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your\nHonour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,\nconceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into\na dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that\ncorner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of\nme.\nThe second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in\nthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.\nWopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\ncountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in\nthe manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.\nBut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,\nthe Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,\u2014on account of\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of\nhis daughter's heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a\nflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,\u2014summoned a sententious\nEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,\nafter an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a\nhigh-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.\nThe business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked\nat, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various\ncolours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with\ngreat surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he\nwere lost in amazement.\nThere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.\nWopsle's eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\nmind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat\nthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large\nwatch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking of\nit when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him",

But who\nelse was there?\"\n\"Who else?\"\n\"It is the strangest thing,\" said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost\nlook again; \"and yet I could swear to him.\"\nBecoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.\n\"Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,\"\nsaid Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, \"I can't be positive;\nyet I think I should.\"\nInvoluntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me\nwhen I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.\n\"Oh! He can't be in sight,\" said Mr. Wopsle. \"He went out before I went\noff. I saw him go.\"\nHaving the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected\nthis poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some\nadmission. Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but\nsaid nothing.\n\"I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw\nthat you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a\nghost.\"\nMy former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak\nyet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on\nto induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was\nperfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.\n\"I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is\nso very strange! You'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I\ncould hardly believe it myself, if you told me.\"\n\"Indeed?\" said I.\n\"No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas\nDay, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery's, and some\nsoldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?\"\n\"I remember it very well.\"\n\"And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that\nwe joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took\nthe lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?\"\n\"I remember it all very well.\" Better than he thought,\u2014except the last\nclause.\n\"And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that\nthere was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been\nseverely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?\"\n\"I see it all before me.\"\n\"And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,\nand that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,\nwith the torchlight shining on their faces,\u2014I am particular about\nthat,\u2014with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an\nouter ring of dark night all about us?\"\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"I remember all that.\"\n\"Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I\nsaw him over your shoulder.\"\n\"Steady!\" I thought. I asked him then, \"Which of the two do you suppose\nyou saw?\"\n\"The one who had been mauled,\" he answered readily, \"and I'll swear I\nsaw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.\"\n\"This is very curious!\" said I, with the best assumption I could put on\nof its being nothing more to me. \"Very curious indeed!\"\nI cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation\nthrew me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson's\nhaving been behind me \"like a ghost.\" For if he had ever been out of my\nthoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was\nin those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I\nshould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I\nhad shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had\nfound him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,\nbecause I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger\nthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.\nI put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He\ncould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.\nIt was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to\nidentify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me,\nand known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How\nwas he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,\nin black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I\nbelieved not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no\nespecial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a\nface at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.\nWhen Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I\nextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate\nrefreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was\nbetween twelve and one o'clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates\nwere shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home.",

Although I should not have\nthought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much\nas a look to Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no\nobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way.

At once, I think.\"\n\"If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,\" said Wemmick to Mr.\nJaggers, \"he needn't write an answer, you know.\"\nReceiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I\nsettled that I would go to-morrow, and said so.

He is a promising fellow\u2014in his way\u2014but he may not have it all\nhis own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to\nbe found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her\u2014\"\n\"Surely,\" I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, \"you do not\nseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?\"\n\"I didn't say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and\nbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be\na question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance work\nto give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such\ncircumstances, because it's a toss-up between two results.\"\n\"May I ask what they are?\"\n\"A fellow like our friend the Spider,\" answered Mr. Jaggers, \"either\nbeats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but\nhe either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick _his_ opinion.\"\n\"Either beats or cringes,\" said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself\nto me.\n\"So here's to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,\" said Mr. Jaggers, taking a\ndecanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of\nus and for himself, \"and may the question of supremacy be settled to\nthe lady's satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady _and_ the\ngentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow\nyou are to-day!\"\nShe was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the\ntable. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,\nnervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers,\nas she spoke, arrested my attention.\n\"What's the matter?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,\" said I, \"was rather\npainful to me.\"\nThe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood\nlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did\ngo. Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and\nsuch hands on a memorable occasion very lately!\nHe dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those\nhands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I\ncompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and\na stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\nhousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\nme when I last walked\u2014not alone\u2014in the ruined garden, and through the\ndeserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I\nsaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach\nwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\nlightning, when I had passed in a carriage\u2014not alone\u2014through a sudden\nglare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association\nhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\nwanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\nchance swift from Estella's name to the fingers with their knitting\naction, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this\nwoman was Estella's mother.\nMr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed\nthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said\nthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the\nwine again, and went on with his dinner.\nOnly twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the\nroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands\nwere Estella's hands, and her eyes were Estella's eyes, and if she had\nreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less\nsure that my conviction was the truth.\nIt was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,\nquite as a matter of business,\u2014just as he might have drawn his salary\nwhen that came round,\u2014and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of\nperpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,\nhis post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office\nfor its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong\ntwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.\nWe took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping\namong Mr. Jaggers's stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right\ntwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\nGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was\nwalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had\nevaporated into the evening air.\n\"Well!\" said Wemmick, \"that's over! He's a wonderful man, without his\nliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine",

I feel a particular interest in\nbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\ngoes no further.\"\n\"Well!\" Wemmick replied, \"I don't know her story,\u2014that is, I don't know\nall of it. But what I do know I'll tell you. We are in our private and\npersonal capacities, of course.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\nmurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\nwas up, as you may suppose.\"\n\"But she was acquitted.\"\n\"Mr. Jaggers was for her,\" pursued Wemmick, with a look full of\nmeaning, \"and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a\ndesperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and\nhe worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to\nhave made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day\nfor many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial\nwhere he couldn't work it himself, sat under counsel, and\u2014every one\nknew\u2014put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,\u2014a\nwoman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.\nIt was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman\nin Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick\n(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of\njealousy. The murdered woman,\u2014more a match for the man, certainly, in\npoint of years\u2014was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had\nbeen a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched\nand torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,\nthere was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this\nwoman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.\nJaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,\" said Wemmick,\ntouching me on the sleeve, \"that he never dwelt upon the strength of\nher hands then, though he sometimes does now.\"\nI had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\nparty.\n\"Well, sir!\" Wemmick went on; \"it happened\u2014happened, don't you\nsee?\u2014that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her\napprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\nparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a\nbruise or two about her,\u2014nothing for a tramp,\u2014but the backs of her\nhands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?\nNow, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of\nbrambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not\nhave got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles\nwere actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the\nfact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have\nbeen broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little\nspots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made\nwas this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that\nshe was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the\nmurder, frantically destroyed her child by this man\u2014some three years\nold\u2014to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:\n\"We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and\nwe show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and\nyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept\nall consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have\nscratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder\nof her child; why don't you? As to this case, if you _will_ have\nscratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted\nfor them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented\nthem?\" \"To sum up, sir,\" said Wemmick, \"Mr. Jaggers was altogether too\nmany for the jury, and they gave in.\"\n\"Has she been in his service ever since?\"\n\"Yes; but not only that,\" said Wemmick, \"she went into his service\nimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since\nbeen taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was\ntamed from the beginning.\"\n\"Do you remember the sex of the child?\"\n\"Said to have been a girl.\"\n\"You have nothing more to say to me to-night?\"\n\"Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.\"\nWe exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for",

            "text": "The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet\nechoing courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old\nmonks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong\nwalls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,\nwere almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral\nchimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried\non avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell\nof the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the\nrooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high\ntrees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was\nchanged, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.\nAn elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who\nlived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the\ngate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,\nand I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was\nnot in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.\nLooking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on\nthe hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the\ncontemplation of, the ashy fire.\nDoing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old\nchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There\nwas an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to\npity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could\ncharge her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in\nthe progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked\nfortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in\na low voice, \"Is it real?\"\n\"It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost\nno time.\"\n\"Thank you. Thank you.\"\nAs I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I\nremarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.\n\"I want,\" she said, \"to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when\nyou were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But\nperhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my\nheart?\"\nWhen I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous\nright hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it\nagain before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.\n\"You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do\nsomething useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it\nnot?\"\n\"Something that I would like done very much.\"\n\"What is it?\"\nI began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had\nnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking\nin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be\nso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed\nthat she was conscious of the fact.\n\"Do you break off,\" she asked then, with her former air of being afraid\nof me, \"because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?\"\n\"No, no,\" I answered, \"how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped\nbecause I thought you were not following what I said.\"\n\"Perhaps I was not,\" she answered, putting a hand to her head. \"Begin\nagain, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.\"\nShe set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\nhabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\nforcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her\nhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in\nthis I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)\ninvolved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they\nwere the weighty secrets of another.\n\"So!\" said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. \"And\nhow much money is wanting to complete the purchase?\"\nI was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. \"Nine\nhundred pounds.\"\n\"If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as\nyou have kept your own?\"\n\"Quite as faithfully.\"\n\"And your mind will be more at rest?\"\n\"Much more at rest.\"\n\"Are you very unhappy now?\"\nShe asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an\nunwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my\nvoice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and\nsoftly laid her forehead on it.\n\"I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of\ndisquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.\"\nAfter a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire\nagain.\n\"It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\nunhappiness. Is it true?\"\n\"Too true.\"\n\"Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as\ndone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?\"\n\"Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the\ntone of the question. But there is nothing.\"\nShe presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\nfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung\nfrom her neck.\n\"You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?\"\n\"Quite. I dined with him yesterday.\"\n\"This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your\nirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if\nyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it\nto you.\"\n\"Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving\nit from him.\"\nShe read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\nreceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled\nagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\npencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without\nlooking at me.\n\"My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, \"I\nforgive her,\" though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\nit!\"\n\"O Miss Havisham,\" said I, \"I can do it now. There have been sore\nmistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want\nforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.\"\nShe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,\nand, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees\nat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have\nbeen raised to heaven from her mother's side.\nTo see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\ngave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got\nmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of\nmine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and\nwept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that\nthe relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was\nnot kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\n\"O!\" she cried, despairingly. \"What have I done! What have I done!\"\n\"If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me\nanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances.\nIs she married?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nIt was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house\nhad told me so.\n\"What have I done! What have I done!\" She wrung her hands, and crushed\nher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. \"What\nhave I done!\"\nI knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\nthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found\nvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light of\nday, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,\nher mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew\nequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her\npunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this\nearth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become\na master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,\nthe vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been\ncurses in this world?\n\"Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a\nlooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know\nwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!\" And so again,\ntwenty, fifty times over, What had she done!\n\"Miss Havisham,\" I said, when her cry had died away, \"you may dismiss\nme from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and\nif you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\npart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.\"\n\"Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip\u2014my dear!\" There was an earnest womanly\ncompassion for me in her new affection. \"My dear! Believe this: when\nshe first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At\nfirst, I meant no more.\"\n\"Well, well!\" said I. \"I hope so.\"\n\"But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did\nworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,\nand with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and\npoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.\"\n\"Better,\" I could not help saying, \"to have left her a natural heart,\neven to be bruised or broken.\"\nWith that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and\nthen burst out again, What had she done!\n\"If you knew all my story,\" she pleaded, \"you would have some\ncompassion for me and a better understanding of me.\"\n\"Miss Havisham,\" I answered, as delicately as I could, \"I believe I may\nsay that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first\nleft this neighbourhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration,\nand I hope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed\nbetween us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to\nEstella? Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?\"\nShe was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and\nher head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and\nreplied, \"Go on.\"\n\"Whose child was Estella?\"\nShe shook her head.\n\"You don't know?\"\nShe shook her head again.\n\"But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?\"\n\"Brought her here.\"\n\"Will you tell me how that came about?\"\nShe answered in a low whisper and with caution: \"I had been shut up in\nthese rooms a long time (I don't know how long; you know what time the\nclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear\nand love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent for\nhim to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the\nnewspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would\nlook about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here\nasleep, and I called her Estella.\"\n\"Might I ask her age then?\"\n\"Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an\norphan and I adopted her.\"\nSo convinced I was of that woman's being her mother, that I wanted no\nevidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I\nthought, the connection here was clear and straight.\nWhat more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had\nsucceeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew\nof Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No\nmatter with what other words we parted; we parted.\nTwilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I\ncalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I\nwould not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before\nleaving. For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again,\nand I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.",

            "text": "By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which\nthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and\nleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on\nend, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by\nthe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the\npaths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary\nall!\nTaking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little\ndoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at\nthe opposite door,\u2014not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started\nand swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was\nencumbered with a growth of fungus,\u2014when I turned my head to look back.\nA childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of\nthe slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to\nthe beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam\nshuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,\u2014though to be\nsure I was there in an instant.\nThe mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this\nillusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an\nindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I\nhad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on\ninto the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let\nme out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go\nupstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I\nhad left her. I took the latter course and went up.\nI looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in\nthe ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back\ntowards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly\naway, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw\nher running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about\nher, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.\nI had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.\nThat I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over\nher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same\npurpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,\nand all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the\nground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered\nher, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,\u2014that this\noccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or\nthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the\nfloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were\nfloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded\nbridal dress.\nThen, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\naway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries\nat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like\na prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or\nwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the\nflames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her\ngarments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.\nShe was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even\ntouched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if I\nunreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire\nwould break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon's\ncoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my\nhands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of\nfeeling.\nOn examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,\nbut that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay\nmainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon's directions, her bed was\ncarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to\nbe well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again,\nan hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her\nstick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.\nThough every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she still\nhad something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had\ncovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with a\nwhite sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that\nhad been and was changed was still upon her.\nI found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I\ngot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next\npost. Miss Havisham's family I took upon myself; intending to\ncommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he\nliked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert,\nas soon as I returned to town.\nThere was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had\nhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she\nbegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that\nshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, \"What have I done!\"\nAnd then, \"When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like\nmine.\" And then, \"Take the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive\nher!'\" She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she\nsometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in\nanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.\nAs I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that\npressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could\nnot drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I\nwould return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and\nbeing taken up clear of the town. At about six o'clock of the morning,\ntherefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as\nthey said, not stopping for being touched, \"Take the pencil and write\nunder my name, 'I forgive her.'\"",

It\nwas another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had been\na struggle\u2014in a barn. Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair,\nmay be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for the\nvictim was found throttled.\"\n\"Was the woman brought in guilty?\"\n\"No; she was acquitted.\u2014My poor Handel, I hurt you!\"\n\"It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?\"\n\"This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little\nchild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the\nyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore\nthat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he\nshould never see it again; then she vanished.\u2014There's the worst arm\ncomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right\nhand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light than\nby a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don't see the poor\nblistered patches too distinctly.\u2014You don't think your breathing is\naffected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.\"\n\"Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?\"\n\"There comes the darkest part of Provis's life. She did.\"\n\"That is, he says she did.\"\n\"Why, of course, my dear boy,\" returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,\nand again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. \"He says it all.\nI have no other information.\"\n\"No, to be sure.\"\n\"Now, whether,\" pursued Herbert, \"he had used the child's mother ill,\nor whether he had used the child's mother well, Provis doesn't say; but\nshe had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he\ndescribed to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for\nher, and forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be\ncalled upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause\nof her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept\nhimself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was\nonly vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the\njealousy arose. After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost\nthe child and the child's mother.\"",

And you have seen her still more recently.\"\n\"Yes?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Perhaps I know more of Estella's history than even you do,\" said I. \"I\nknow her father too.\"\nA certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner\u2014he was too\nself-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being\nbrought to an indefinably attentive stop\u2014assured me that he did not\nknow who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis's\naccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;\nwhich I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers's\nclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reason\nfor claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this\nunconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers's part before, though I was quite sure\nof it now.\n\"So! You know the young lady's father, Pip?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"and his name is Provis\u2014from New South Wales.\"\nEven Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest\nstart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the\nsooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the\naction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the\nannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just\nthen, lest Mr. Jaggers's sharpness should detect that there had been\nsome communication unknown to him between us.\n\"And on what evidence, Pip,\" asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he\npaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, \"does Provis make\nthis claim?\"\n\"He does not make it,\" said I, \"and has never made it, and has no\nknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.\"\nFor once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so\nunexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\nwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked\nwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.\nThen I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation\nthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact\nknew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look\ntowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been",

When I did at last\nturn my eyes in Wemmick's direction, I found that he had unposted his\npen, and was intent upon the table before him.\n\"Hah!\" said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the\ntable. \"What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?\"\nBut I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a\npassionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and\nmanly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had\nlapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had\nmade: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I\nrepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence\nfrom him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said\nthat I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted\nassurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,\nand why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he\ncared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,\nand that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,\nwhatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\nelse in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and\nsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to\nWemmick, and said, \"Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle\nheart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the\ninnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\nlife. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to\nrepresent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be\nmore open with me!\"\nI have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.\nJaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving\ncrossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his\nemployment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something\nlike a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.\n\"What's all this?\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"You with an old father, and you\nwith pleasant and playful ways?\"\n\"Well!\" returned Wemmick. \"If I don't bring 'em here, what does it\nmatter?\"\n\"Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling\nopenly, \"this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.\"\n\"Not a bit of it,\" returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. \"I\nthink you're another.\"\nAgain they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still\ndistrustful that the other was taking him in.\n\"_You_ with a pleasant home?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Since it don't interfere with business,\" returned Wemmick, \"let it be\nso. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn't wonder if _you_ might be\nplanning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of\nthese days, when you're tired of all this work.\"\nMr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and\nactually drew a sigh. \"Pip,\" said he, \"we won't talk about 'poor\ndreams;' you know more about such things than I, having much fresher\nexperience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I'll put a\ncase to you. Mind! I admit nothing.\"\nHe waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly\nsaid that he admitted nothing.\n\"Now, Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"put this case. Put the case that a\nwoman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child\nconcealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal\nadviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to\nthe latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put\nthe case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\neccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.\"\n\"I follow you, sir.\"\n\"Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he\nsaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\ndestruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\na criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that\nhe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,\nneglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing\nup to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\nin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,\nto develop into the fish that were to come to his net,\u2014to be\nprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.\"\n\"I follow you, sir.\"\n\"Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the\nheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make\nno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this\npower: \"I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so,\nyou did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you\nthrough it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it\nshould be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be\nproduced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring\nyou off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,\nyour child is still saved.\" Put the case that this was done, and that\nthe woman was cleared.\"\n\"I understand you perfectly.\"\n\"But that I make no admissions?\"\n\"That you make no admissions.\" And Wemmick repeated, \"No admissions.\"\n\"Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little\nshaken the woman's intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,\nshe was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be\nsheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the\nold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\nout, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend\nthe imaginary case?\"\n\"Quite.\"\n\"Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That\nthe mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the\nmother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\nmiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was\nstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case\nto yourself very carefully.\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.\"\nAnd Wemmick said, \"I do.\"\n\"For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father's? I think\nhe would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother's? I\nthink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For\nthe daughter's? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her\nparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to\ndisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for\nlife. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her\nthe subject of those 'poor dreams' which have, at one time or another,\nbeen in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you\nthat you had better\u2014and would much sooner when you had thought well of\nit\u2014chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right\nhand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut _that_ off\ntoo.\"",

For this reason, I suppose, they were now\ninflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and\nWemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest\npoint in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such ill\nterms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.\nBut they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of\nMike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on\nhis sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance\nwithin those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or\nin that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble\n(which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest\ndaughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this\nmelancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially\nbefore the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike's eye\nhappened to twinkle with a tear.\n\"What are you about?\" demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.\n\"What do you come snivelling here for?\"\n\"I didn't go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.\"\n\"You did,\" said Wemmick. \"How dare you? You're not in a fit state to\ncome here, if you can't come here without spluttering like a bad pen.\nWhat do you mean by it?\"\n\"A man can't help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,\" pleaded Mike.\n\"His what?\" demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. \"Say that again!\"\n\"Now look here my man,\" said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and\npointing to the door. \"Get out of this office. I'll have no feelings\nhere. Get out.\"\n\"It serves you right,\" said Wemmick, \"Get out.\"\nSo, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and\nWemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and\nwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had\njust had lunch.",

Early in the week, or say\nWednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try\nit. Now burn.\"\nWhen I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire\u2014but not\nbefore we had both got it by heart\u2014we considered what to do. For, of\ncourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.\n\"I have thought it over again and again,\" said Herbert, \"and I think I\nknow a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A\ngood fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and\nhonourable.\"\nI had thought of him more than once.\n\"But how much would you tell him, Herbert?\"\n\"It is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere\nfreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know\nthat there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.\nYou go with him?\"\n\"No doubt.\"\n\"Where?\"\nIt had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the\npoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,\u2014Hamburg, Rotterdam,\nAntwerp,\u2014the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I\nhad always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\nboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\nleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\ndown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\nuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\nlay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\nmade inquiries beforehand.\nHerbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\nHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\nsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\nourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separated\nfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\nHerbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\nwithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o'clock reported it\ndone. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\nStartop, and he was more than ready to join.\nThose two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;\nour charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our\nobject, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not\ncome home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that\nhe should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he\nshould prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on\nWednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the\narrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that\nhe should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on\nboard.",

And why?

Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!\"\n\"Your appetite's been touched like by your accident,\" said the\nlandlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. \"Try a tenderer\nbit.\"\n\"No, thank you,\" I replied, turning from the table to brood over the\nfire. \"I can eat no more.

Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It\nlay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the\ntools and barrows that were lying about.\nComing up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,\u2014for the rude\npath lay through it,\u2014I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened\nmy pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,\nI looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken,\nand how the house\u2014of wood with a tiled roof\u2014would not be proof against\nthe weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and\nooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapour of the kiln\ncrept in a ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I\nknocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch.\nIt rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a\nlighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle\nbedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, \"Is there any one here?\"\nbut no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it\nwas past nine, called again, \"Is there any one here?\" There being still\nno answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.\nIt was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen\nalready, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the\nshelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was\nconsidering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be\ncoming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head\nto look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken\nup the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent\nshock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in\na strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.\n\"Now,\" said a suppressed voice with an oath, \"I've got you!\"\n\"What is this?\" I cried, struggling. \"Who is it? Help, help, help!\"\nNot only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my\nbad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man's hand,\nsometimes a strong man's breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my\ncries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled\nineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. \"And\nnow,\" said the suppressed voice with another oath, \"call out again, and\nI'll make short work of you!\"\nFaint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the\nsurprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in\nexecution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.\nBut, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt\nbefore, it were now being boiled.\nThe sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black\ndarkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.\nAfter groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he\nwanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the\nsparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and\nbreathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue\npoint of the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,\u2014no\nwonder there,\u2014and one after another the sparks died out.\nThe man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As\nthe sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and\ntouches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending\nover the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,\nbreathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and\nshowed me Orlick.\nWhom I had looked for, I don't know. I had not looked for him. Seeing\nhim, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes\nupon him.\nHe lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,\nand dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away\nfrom him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms\nfolded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to\na stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,\u2014a fixture\nthere,\u2014the means of ascent to the loft above.\n\"Now,\" said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, \"I've\ngot you.\"\n\"Unbind me. Let me go!\"\n\"Ah!\" he returned, \"_I_'ll let you go. I'll let you go to the moon,\nI'll let you go to the stars. All in good time.\"\n\"Why have you lured me here?\"\n\"Don't you know?\" said he, with a deadly look.\n\"Why have you set upon me in the dark?\"\n\"Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than\ntwo. O you enemy, you enemy!\"\nHis enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms\nfolded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a\nmalignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence, he\nput his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a\nbrass-bound stock.\n\"Do you know this?\" said he, making as if he would take aim at me. \"Do\nyou know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!\"\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n[Illustration]\n\"You cost me that place. You did. Speak!\"\n\"What else could I do?\"\n\"You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to\ncome betwixt me and a young woman I liked?\"\n\"When did I?\"\n\"When didn't you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to\nher.\"\n\"You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done\nyou no harm, if you had done yourself none.\"\n\"You're a liar. And you'll take any pains, and spend any money, to\ndrive me out of this country, will you?\" said he, repeating my words to\nBiddy in the last interview I had with her. \"Now, I'll tell you a piece\nof information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of\nthis country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty\ntimes told, to the last brass farden!\" As he shook his heavy hand at\nme, with his mouth snarling like a tiger's, I felt that it was true.\n\"What are you going to do to me?\"\n\"I'm a-going,\" said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a\nheavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,\u2014\"I'm\na-going to have your life!\"\nHe leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it\nacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.\n\"You was always in Old Orlick's way since ever you was a child. You\ngoes out of his way this present night. He'll have no more on you.\nYou're dead.\"\nI felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked\nwildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.\n\"More than that,\" said he, folding his arms on the table again, \"I\nwon't have a rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth.\nI'll put your body in the kiln,\u2014I'd carry two such to it, on my\nshoulders\u2014and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall\nnever know nothing.\"\nMy mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences\nof such a death. Estella's father would believe I had deserted him,\nwould be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,\nwhen he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had\ncalled at Miss Havisham's gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would\nnever know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I\nhad suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed\nthrough. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible\nthan death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And so\nquick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn\ngenerations,\u2014Estella's children, and their children,\u2014while the wretch's\nwords were yet on his lips.\n\"Now, wolf,\" said he, \"afore I kill you like any other beast,\u2014which is\nwot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,\u2014I'll have a good look\nat you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!\"\nIt had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few\ncould know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the\nhopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by\na scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I\nresolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some\nlast poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of\nmen were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of\nHeaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no\nfarewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to\nme, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my\nmiserable errors,\u2014still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I\nwould have done it.\nHe had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his\nneck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink\nslung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and\ntook a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw\nflash into his face.\n\"Wolf!\" said he, folding his arms again, \"Old Orlick's a-going to tell\nyou somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.\"\nAgain my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted\nthe whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her\ndeath, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.\n\"It was you, villain,\" said I.\n\"I tell you it was your doing,\u2014I tell you it was done through you,\" he\nretorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the\nvacant air between us. \"I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you\nto-night. _I_ giv' it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a\nlimekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn't have come\nto life again. But it warn't Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was\nfavoured, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?\nNow you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.\"\nHe drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of the\nbottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly\nunderstood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an\nend of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew\nthat when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept\ntowards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he\nwould do as he had done in my sister's case,\u2014make all haste to the\ntown, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My\nrapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with\nhim in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and\nthe white vapour creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.\nIt was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years\nwhile he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented\npictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of\nmy brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons\nwithout seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of\nthese images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him\nhimself,\u2014who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!\u2014that\nI knew of the slightest action of his fingers.\nWhen he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which he\nsat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,\nshading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me,\nstood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.\n\"Wolf, I'll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled\nover on your stairs that night.\"\nI saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of\nthe heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman's lantern on the wall. I\nsaw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;\nthere, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.\n\"And why was Old Orlick there? I'll tell you something more, wolf. You\nand her _have_ pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as\ngetting a easy living in it goes, and I've took up with new companions,\nand new masters. Some of 'em writes my letters when I wants 'em\nwrote,\u2014do you mind?\u2014writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;\nthey're not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I've had a firm mind\nand a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your\nsister's burying. I han't seen a way to get you safe, and I've looked\narter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,\n'Somehow or another I'll have him!' What! When I looks for you, I finds\nyour uncle Provis, eh?\"\nMill Pond Bank, and Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,\nall so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was\nover, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his\nback, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running\nout to sea!\n\"_You_ with a uncle too! Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so\nsmall a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and\nthumb and chucked you away dead (as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times,\nwhen I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you\nhadn't found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for\nto hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old\nOrlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year\nago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a\nbullock, as he means to drop you\u2014hey?\u2014when he come for to hear\nthat\u2014hey?\"\nIn his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I\nturned my face aside to save it from the flame.\n\"Ah!\" he cried, laughing, after doing it again, \"the burnt child dreads\nthe fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was\nsmuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick's a match for you and\nknow'd you'd come to-night! Now I'll tell you something more, wolf, and\nthis ends it. There's them that's as good a match for your uncle Provis\nas Old Orlick has been for you. Let him 'ware them, when he's lost his\nnevvy! Let him 'ware them, when no man can't find a rag of his dear\nrelation's clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There's them that can't\nand that won't have Magwitch,\u2014yes, _I_ know the name!\u2014alive in the same\nland with them, and that's had such sure information of him when he was\nalive in another land, as that he couldn't and shouldn't leave it\nunbeknown and put them in danger. P'raps it's them that writes fifty\nhands, and that's not like sneaking you as writes but one. 'Ware\nCompeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!\"\nHe flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an\ninstant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the\nlight on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and\nBiddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.\nThere was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the\nopposite wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and\nforwards. His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever\nbefore, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his\nsides, and with his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left.\nWild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures\nthat rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand\nthat, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely\nperishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me what\nhe had told.\nOf a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed it\naway. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed\nslowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked\nat me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of\nhis hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and\nswearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw\nin his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.\nThe resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one\nvain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and\nstruggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I\ncould move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until\nthen unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard\nresponsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the\ndoor, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of\nmen, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly\nout into the night.",

            "text": "After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the\nsame place, with my head on some one's knee. My eyes were fixed on the\nladder against the wall, when I came to myself,\u2014had opened on it before\nmy mind saw it,\u2014and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\nwas in the place where I had lost it.\nToo indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who\nsupported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came\nbetween me and it a face. The face of Trabb's boy!\n\"I think he's all right!\" said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice; \"but\nain't he just pale though!\"\nAt these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\nand I saw my supporter to be\u2014\n\"Herbert! Great Heaven!\"\n\"Softly,\" said Herbert. \"Gently, Handel. Don't be too eager.\"\n\"And our old comrade, Startop!\" I cried, as he too bent over me.\n\"Remember what he is going to assist us in,\" said Herbert, \"and be\ncalm.\"\nThe allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in\nmy arm. \"The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\nto-night? How long have I been here?\" For, I had a strange and strong\nmisgiving that I had been lying there a long time\u2014a day and a\nnight,\u2014two days and nights,\u2014more.\n\"The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.\"\n\"Thank God!\"\n\"And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,\" said Herbert. \"But\nyou can't help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can\nyou stand?\"\n\"Yes, yes,\" said I, \"I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\narm.\"\nThey laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen\nand inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they\ntore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully\nreplaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain\nsome cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the\ndoor of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the\nquarry on our way back. Trabb's boy\u2014Trabb's overgrown young man\nnow\u2014went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come\nin at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I\nhad last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.\nThe white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as\nI had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.\nEntreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,\u2014which at\nfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\nquiet,\u2014I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\nchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\nmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was\ngone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\nhour's consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\nvolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.\nFinding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\nresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\nBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\nfinding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's, where they lost me.\nHereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\nI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.\nAmong the loungers under the Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's\nBoy,\u2014true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he\nhad no business,\u2014and Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss\nHavisham's in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's boy became\ntheir guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by\nthe town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went\nalong, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought\nthere on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's\nsafety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be\nmischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and\nwent on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,\nendeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could\nhear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was\nwhile my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I\nwas there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,\nand rushed in, closely followed by the other two.\nWhen I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our\nimmediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it\nwas, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such\na course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be\nfatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\npresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\nlight of the matter to Trabb's boy; who, I am convinced, would have\nbeen much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his\nintervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb's boy was of a\nmalignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it\nwas in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's\nexpense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed\nto meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an\nill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).\nWednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London\nthat night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be\nclear away before the night's adventure began to be talked of. Herbert\ngot a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this\nstuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear\nits pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,\nand I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.\nMy terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for\nto-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of\nitself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the\nmental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon\nme that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with\nsuch consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.\nNo precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from\ncommunication with him that day; yet this again increased my\nrestlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing\nthat he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me\nso. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was\nsomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the\nfact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days\nwore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,\nmy overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow\nmorning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning\nhead throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to\nhigh numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew\nin prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\nfatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to\nmyself with a start, \"Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!\"\nThey kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed,\nand gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the\nnotion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and\nthe opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed\nand went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for\nfour-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last\nself-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept\nsoundly.\nWednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking\nlights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a\nmarsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was\nspanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there\nat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the\nclustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the\nunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn\nfrom the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.\nFrom me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.\nHerbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on\nthe sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the\nfire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In\ngood time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the\nsharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still\nflowing towards us.",

Of course, I had\ntaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After\na little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two\nor three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went\non board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then\nabout high-water,\u2014half-past eight.\nOur plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being\nwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,\nand row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long\nreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is\nbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and\nwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we\ncould choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all\nnight. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would\nstart from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at\nwhat time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail\nthe first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we\nshould have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each\nvessel.\nThe relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was\nso great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in\nwhich I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the\nmovement on the river, and the moving river itself,\u2014the road that ran\nwith us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us\non,\u2014freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use\nin the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,\nand they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.\nAt that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present\nextent, and watermen's boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing\ncolliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but\nof steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so\nmany. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and\nthere that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;\nthe navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a\nmuch easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and\nwe went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.\nOld London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its\noyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor's Gate, and\nwe were in among the tiers of shipping.

By that time the river had lifted us a\nlittle, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on\nthe low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into\nblack; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were\nthe rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,\nsave here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.\nAs the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,\nwould not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for\nclearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could\nfind. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for\nanything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or\nfive dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with\nher galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.\nThe night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and\nwhat light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as\nthe oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.\nAt this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we\nwere followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular\nintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or\nother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and\nthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\ncreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them\nnervously. Sometimes, \"What was that ripple?\" one of us would say in a\nlow voice. Or another, \"Is that a boat yonder?\" And afterwards we would\nfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with\nwhat an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.",

By that\ntime it wanted but ten minutes of one o'clock, and we began to look out\nfor her smoke.\nBut, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards\nwe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on\nat full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of\nsaying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands\ncordially, and neither Herbert's eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I\nsaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\nahead of us, and row out into the same track.\nA stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer's smoke,\nby reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,\ncoming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the\ntide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to\nsit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, \"Trust to\nme, dear boy,\" and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was\nvery skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and\nfallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,\nshe kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or\ntwo when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and\nlooked at us attentively,\u2014as did all the rowers; the other sitter was\nwrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some\ninstruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in\neither boat.\nStartop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\nand gave me the word \"Hamburg,\" in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\nShe was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew\nlouder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,\nwhen the galley hailed us. I answered.\n\"You have a returned Transport there,\" said the man who held the lines.\n\"That's the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\notherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\nand you to assist.\"\nAt the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\nhe ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke\nahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on\nto our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\nconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\nheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but\nfelt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw\nthe steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner's shoulder,\nand saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,\nand saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\nfrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,\nlean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\nshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that\nthe face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.\nStill, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white\nterror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board\nthe steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink\nfrom under me.\nIt was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\nmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\ntaken on board the galley.

Presently a dark object was seen in it,\nbearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up\nhis hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and\ntrue before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,\nbut not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled\nat the wrists and ankles.\nThe galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water\nwas resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not\nunderstanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had\nbeen hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and\nwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out\nwas kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were\ngone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.\nAt length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern\nwe had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.\nHere I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,\u2014Provis no\nlonger,\u2014who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and a\ndeep cut in the head.\nHe told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the\nsteamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to\nhis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought\nhe had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did\nnot pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,\nbut that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify\nhim, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had\nboth gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him\n(Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him\nin it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down\nfiercely locked in each other's arms, and that there had been a\nstruggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,\nand swum away.\nI never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told\nme. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their\ngoing overboard.\nWhen I asked this officer's permission to change the prisoner's wet\nclothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the\npublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take\ncharge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book\nwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer's. He further\ngave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to\naccord that grace to my two friends.\nThe Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\ndown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\nlikeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to\nbe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\nvarious stages of decay.\nWe remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then\nMagwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and\nStartop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a\ndoleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch's side, I felt\nthat that was my place henceforth while he lived.\nFor now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,\nwounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man\nwho had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,\ngratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a\nseries of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to",

Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had\nmeant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened\nthat there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could\ngive the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his\nprivate house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and\nMr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing. It was the\nsole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five\nminutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could\nprevent its going against us.\nI imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\nfate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\nhaving \"let it slip through my fingers,\" and said we must memorialise\nby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal\nfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which the\nforfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this\ncase to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not\nrelated to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;\nhe had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his\napprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I\nfinally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my\nheart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to\nestablish one.\nThere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had\nhoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some\naccurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs. When his body was found, many\nmiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he\nwas only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still\nlegible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a\nbanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\ninformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\nJaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His\nignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but\nthat my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.\nAfter three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over\nfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness\ncame, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial\nat the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.",

And when I come away from\nhim, you know that my thoughts are with him.\"\nThe dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to\nboth of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Herbert, \"let the near prospect of our\nseparation\u2014for, it is very near\u2014be my justification for troubling you\nabout yourself. Have you thought of your future?\"\n\"No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.\"\n\"But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must\nnot be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few\nfriendly words go, with me.\"\n\"I will,\" said I.\n\"In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a\u2014\"\nI saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, \"A\nclerk.\"\n\"A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as a\nclerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,\nHandel,\u2014in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?\"\nThere was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in\nwhich after saying \"Now, Handel,\" as if it were the grave beginning of\na portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,\nstretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.\n\"Clara and I have talked about it again and again,\" Herbert pursued,\n\"and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in\nher eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come\ntogether, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her\nhusband's friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,\nHandel!\"\nI thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could\nnot yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my\nmind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.\nSecondly,\u2014Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my\nthoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.\n\"But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury\nto your business, leave the question open for a little while\u2014\"\n\"For any while,\" cried Herbert. \"Six months, a year!\"\n\"Not so long as that,\" said I. \"Two or three months at most.\"\nHerbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,\nand said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must\ngo away at the end of the week.\n\"And Clara?\" said I.\n\"The dear little thing,\" returned Herbert, \"holds dutifully to her\nfather as long as he lasts; but he won't last long. Mrs. Whimple\nconfides to me that he is certainly going.\"\n\"Not to say an unfeeling thing,\" said I, \"he cannot do better than go.\"\n\"I am afraid that must be admitted,\" said Herbert; \"and then I shall\ncome back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I",

I had not seen him\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had\ncome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of\nexplanation in reference to that failure.\n\"The late Compeyson,\" said Wemmick, \"had by little and little got at\nthe bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was\nfrom the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people\nbeing always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,\nseeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I\nthought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only\nsuppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,\nhabitually to deceive his own instruments. You don't blame me, I hope,\nMr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.\"\n\"I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most\nearnestly for all your interest and friendship.\"\n\"Thank you, thank you very much. It's a bad job,\" said Wemmick,\nscratching his head, \"and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a\nlong time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable\nproperty. Dear me!\"\n\"What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.\"\n\"Yes, to be sure,\" said Wemmick. \"Of course, there can be no objection\nto your being sorry for him, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself\nto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and\nbeing so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have\nbeen saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been\nsaved. That's the difference between the property and the owner, don't\nyou see?\"\nI invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of\ngrog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\nwas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up\nto it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,\u2014\n\"What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?\"\n\"Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.\"\n\"These twelve years, more likely,\" said Wemmick. \"Yes. I'm going to\ntake a holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk. More than\nthat; I'm going to ask you to take a walk with me.\"\nI was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,\nwhen Wemmick anticipated me.\n\"I know your engagements,\" said he, \"and I know you are out of sorts,\nMr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\nIt ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy you\n(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn't you\nstretch a point and manage it?\"\nHe had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\nto do for him. I said I could manage it,\u2014would manage it,\u2014and he was so\nvery much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\nparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\npast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.",

Here's a church!\"\nThere was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\nsurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,\u2014\n\"Let's go in!\"\nWe went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked\nall round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,\nand getting something out of paper there.\n\"Halloa!\" said he. \"Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 'em\non!\"\nAs the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\nto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\nwere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\ndoor, escorting a lady.\n\"Halloa!\" said Wemmick. \"Here's Miss Skiffins! Let's have a wedding.\"\nThat discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\nAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the\naltar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to\nput him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\npillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\ngentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\nresistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\nperfection.\nThe clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\nthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\npreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out\nof his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, \"Halloa! Here's a\nring!\"\nI acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;\nwhile a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a\nfeint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of\ngiving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the\nclergyman's being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.\nWhen he said, \"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?\" the\nold gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we\nhad arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.\nUpon which, the clergyman said again, \"WHO giveth this woman to be\nmarried to this man?\" The old gentleman being still in a state of most\nestimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed\nvoice, \"Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?\" To which the Aged replied\nwith great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, \"All right, John,\nall right, my boy!\" And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon\nit, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely\nmarried that day.\nIt was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\nWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,\nand put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,\nput her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. \"_Now_, Mr.\nPip,\" said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\nout, \"let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\nwedding-party!\"\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\nboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\nthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\nunwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in\na high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,\nand submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have\ndone.\nWe had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\ntable, Wemmick said, \"Provided by contract, you know; don't be afraid\nof it!\" I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the\nCastle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I\ncould.\nWemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with\nhim, and wished him joy.\n\"Thankee!\" said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. \"She's such a manager of\nfowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\nyourself. I say, Mr. Pip!\" calling me back, and speaking low. \"This is\naltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.\"\n\"I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,\" said I.",

He had broken\ntwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great\npain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\nvery little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the\nfirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he\nought to hear.\nBeing far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after\nthe first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of\nbeing with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for his\nillness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\ndetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\nAlthough I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\ndo not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\nwasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\nwhen the prison door closed upon him.\nThe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\nwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\ncircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\nway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\nIt happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his\ndesperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in\nattendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his\neyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had\nseen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was\na little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I\nnever knew him complain.",

But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds\nbefore me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that\nI saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\nsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him.\nThe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,\ndown to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering\nin the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside\nit at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and\nwomen; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\nweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\nstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\nand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\ngallery full of people,\u2014a large theatrical audience,\u2014looked on, as the\ntwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\naddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\nbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments\nand punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of\nyears; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had\nmade his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable\nman would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when\nfar removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a\npeaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those\npropensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered\nhim a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and\nrepentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.\nBeing here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading\nthe officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of\nflight, he had resisted them, and had\u2014he best knew whether by express\ndesign, or in the blindness of his hardihood\u2014caused the death of his\ndenouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment\nfor his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his\ncase being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\nThe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\nlight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\nwith absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all\nthings, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face\nin this way of light, the prisoner said, \"My Lord, I have received my\nsentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,\" and sat down\nagain. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had\nto say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of\nthem were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard\nlook of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three\nshook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had\ntaken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of\nhaving to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held\nmy hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got\nup (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),\nand pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him\nand me.",

I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I\nhad finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men\nin authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the\nCrown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took\nno rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed\nin these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away\nfrom the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful\nand less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable\nrestlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,\nwandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.\nTo the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,\ndusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and\ntheir long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.\nThe daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more\nstrictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an\nintention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I\nsat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,\nthat I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the\nsingleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There\nwas duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer\nalways gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick\nprisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as\nsick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be\nthanked!) always joined in the same report.\nAs the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\nlooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\nsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\nunderstand his meaning very well.\nThe number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in\nhim than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and\nlighted up as I entered.\n\"Dear boy,\" he said, as I sat down by his bed: \"I thought you was late.\nBut I knowed you couldn't be that.\"\n\"It is just the time,\" said I. \"I waited for it at the gate.\"\n\"You always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?\"\n\"Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.\"\n\"Thank'ee dear boy, thank'ee. God bless you! You've never deserted me,\ndear boy.\"\nI pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once\nmeant to desert him.\n\"And what's the best of all,\" he said, \"you've been more comfortable\nalonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.\nThat's best of all.\"\nHe lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,\nand love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and\na film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.\n\"Are you in much pain to-day?\"\n\"I don't complain of none, dear boy.\"\n\"You never do complain.\"\nHe had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to\nmean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid\nit there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.\nThe allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,\n\"You needn't go yet.\" I thanked him gratefully, and asked, \"Might I\nspeak to him, if he can hear me?\"\nThe governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\nthough it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid\nlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.\n\"Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I\nsay?\"\nA gentle pressure on my hand.\n\"You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.\"\nA stronger pressure on my hand.\n\"She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a\nlady and very beautiful. And I love her!\"\nWith a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my\nyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying\non it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,\nand his head dropped quietly on his breast.\nMindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men\nwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better\nwords that I could say beside his bed, than \"O Lord, be merciful to him\na sinner!\"",

I ought\nrather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and\nconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth\nbeyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me\nhad enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that\nit was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even\ncareless as to that.\nFor a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,\u2014anywhere,\naccording as I happened to sink down,\u2014with a heavy head and aching\nlimbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which\nappeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;\nand when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I\nfound I could not do so.\nWhether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the\nnight, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether\nI had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great\nterror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found\nmyself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up\nthe stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been\ninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and\ngroaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my\nown making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark\ncorner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again,\nthat Miss Havisham was consuming within it,\u2014these were things that I\ntried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that\nmorning on my bed.

Jeweller's account, I\nthink.\"\n\"What is to be done?\"\n\"You had better come to my house,\" said the man. \"I keep a very nice\nhouse.\"\nI made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended to\nthem, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I\nstill lay there.\n\"You see my state,\" said I. \"I would come with you if I could; but\nindeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die\nby the way.\"\nPerhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to\nbelieve that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in my\nmemory by only this one slender thread, I don't know what they did,\nexcept that they forbore to remove me.\nThat I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I\noften lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I\nconfounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a\nbrick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the",

To-morrow is the first of June.\"\n\"And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?\"\n\"Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your\nbeing ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post,\nand being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal\nof walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part,\nand marriage were the great wish of his hart\u2014\"\n\"It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you\nsaid to Biddy.\"\n\"Which it were,\" said Joe, \"that how you might be amongst strangers,\nand that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a\nmoment might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, 'Go\nto him, without loss of time.' That,\" said Joe, summing up with his\njudicial air, \"were the word of Biddy. 'Go to him,' Biddy say, 'without\nloss of time.' In short, I shouldn't greatly deceive you,\" Joe added,\nafter a little grave reflection, \"if I represented to you that the word\nof that young woman were, 'without a minute's loss of time.'\"\nThere Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to\nin great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at\nstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that\nI was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay\nquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in\nit.\nEvidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at\nhim, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the\npride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its\ncurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as\nthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the\nroom kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own\nwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,\nJoe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the\npen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his\nsleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was\nnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,\nand to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;\nand when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\nhave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen\nspluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on\nthe side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into\nspace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was\ntripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he\ngot on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had\nremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\nhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the\neffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,\nwith unbounded satisfaction.\nNot to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to\ntalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He\nshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.\n\"Is she dead, Joe?\"\n\"Why you see, old chap,\" said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by\nway of getting at it by degrees, \"I wouldn't go so far as to say that,\nfor that's a deal to say; but she ain't\u2014\"\n\"Living, Joe?\"\n\"That's nigher where it is,\" said Joe; \"she ain't living.\"\n\"Did she linger long, Joe?\"\n\"Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you\nwas put to it) a week,\" said Joe; still determined, on my account, to\ncome at everything by degrees.\n\"Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?\"\n\"Well, old chap,\" said Joe, \"it do appear that she had settled the most\nof it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had\nwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the\naccident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,\ndo you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand\nunto him? 'Because of Pip's account of him, the said Matthew.' I am\ntold by Biddy, that air the writing,\" said Joe, repeating the legal\nturn as if it did him infinite good, \"'account of him the said\nMatthew.' And a cool four thousand, Pip!\"\nI never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature\nof the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money\nmore to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being\ncool.\nThis account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I\nhad done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other\nrelations had any legacies?\n\"Miss Sarah,\" said Joe, \"she have twenty-five pound perannium fur to\nbuy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty\npound down. Mrs.\u2014what's the name of them wild beasts with humps, old\nchap?\"\n\"Camels?\" said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.\nJoe nodded. \"Mrs. Camels,\" by which I presently understood he meant\nCamilla, \"she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in\nspirits when she wake up in the night.\"\nThe accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give",

Old Orlick he's been a bustin' open a\ndwelling-ouse.\"\n\"Whose?\" said I.\n\"Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,\" said\nJoe, apologetically; \"still, a Englishman's ouse is his Castle, and\ncastles must not be busted 'cept when done in war time. And wotsume'er\nthe failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.\"\n\"Is it Pumblechook's house that has been broken into, then?\"\n\"That's it, Pip,\" said Joe; \"and they took his till, and they took his\ncash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,\nand they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him\nup to his bedpust, and they giv' him a dozen, and they stuffed his\nmouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he\nknowed Orlick, and Orlick's in the county jail.\"\nBy these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow\nto gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe\nstayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.\nFor the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,\nthat I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in\nthe old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old\nunassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my\nlife since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles\nof the fever that was gone. He did everything for me except the\nhousehold work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, after\npaying off the laundress on his first arrival. \"Which I do assure you,\nPip,\" he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; \"I found her\na tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the\nfeathers in a bucket, for sale. Which she would have tapped yourn next,\nand draw'd it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away\nthe coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the\nwine and spirits in your Wellington boots.\"\nWe looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had\nonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day\ncame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,\ntook me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were\nstill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\nthe wealth of his great nature.\nAnd Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,\nwhere the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,\nand sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be\nSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how\nit had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been\nforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and\nby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning\nand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\nthere came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday\nbells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I\nfelt that I was not nearly thankful enough,\u2014that I was too weak yet to\nbe even that,\u2014and I laid my head on Joe's shoulder, as I had laid it\nlong ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too\nmuch for my young senses.\nMore composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to\ntalk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change\nwhatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my\neyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.\nWhen we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me\u2014so\neasily!\u2014across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful\nChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet\nmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of\nmy late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself\nnow, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself\nwhether I ought to refer to it when he did not.\n\"Have you heard, Joe,\" I asked him that evening, upon further\nconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, \"who my patron\nwas?\"\n\"I heerd,\" returned Joe, \"as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.\"\n\"Did you hear who it was, Joe?\"\n\"Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv' you\nthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.\"\n\"So it was.\"\n\"Astonishing!\" said Joe, in the placidest way.\n\"Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?\" I presently asked, with\nincreasing diffidence.\n\"Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I think,\" said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather\nevasively at the window-seat, \"as I _did_ hear tell that how he were\nsomething or another in a general way in that direction.\"\n\"Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?\"\n\"Not partickler, Pip.\"\n\"If you would like to hear, Joe\u2014\" I was beginning, when Joe got up and\ncame to my sofa.\n\"Lookee here, old chap,\" said Joe, bending over me. \"Ever the best of\nfriends; ain't us, Pip?\"\nI was ashamed to answer him.\n\"Wery good, then,\" said Joe, as if I _had_ answered; \"that's all right;\nthat's agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as\nbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There's subjects enough\nas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your\npoor sister and her Rampages! And don't you remember Tickler?\"\n\"I do indeed, Joe.\"\n\"Lookee here, old chap,\" said Joe. \"I done what I could to keep you and\nTickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my\ninclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it\nwere not so much,\" said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, \"that\nshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that\nshe dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain't a\ngrab at a man's whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your\nsister was quite welcome), that 'ud put a man off from getting a little\nchild out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into\nheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up\nand says to himself, 'Where is the good as you are a-doing? I grant you\nI see the 'arm,' says the man, 'but I don't see the good. I call upon\nyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.'\"\n\"The man says?\" I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\n\"The man says,\" Joe assented. \"Is he right, that man?\"\n\"Dear Joe, he is always right.\"\n\"Well, old chap,\" said Joe, \"then abide by your words. If he's always\nright (which in general he's more likely wrong), he's right when he\nsays this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when\nyou was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know'd as J.\nGargery's power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal\nto his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two\nsech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy\ngiv' herself a deal o' trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost\nawful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this\nlight, as I should so put it. Both of which,\" said Joe, quite charmed\nwith his logical arrangement, \"being done, now this to you a true\nfriend, say. Namely. You mustn't go a overdoing on it, but you must\nhave your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt\nthe sheets.\"\nThe delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact\nand kindness with which Biddy\u2014who with her woman's wit had found me out\nso soon\u2014had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\nwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all\ndissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\nunderstand.\nAnother thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\ndevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\nof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\neasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\nfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\nthe dear \"old Pip, old chap,\" that now were music in my ears. I too had\nfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\nimperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe's hold upon them began\nto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\nall mine.\nAh! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\nin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\nJoe's innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\nstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\nloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?\nIt was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\nTemple Gardens leaning on Joe's arm, that I saw this change in him very\nplainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at\nthe river, and I chanced to say as we got up,\u2014\n\"See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back\nby myself.\"\n\"Which do not overdo it, Pip,\" said Joe; \"but I shall be happy fur to\nsee you able, sir.\"\nThe last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\nfurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker\nthan I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\nthoughtful.\nI, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\nchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\ndown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\nquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\nsavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\nmust not suffer him to do it.\nIt was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\nbed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,\u2014to-morrow being\nSunday,\u2014and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\nmorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\nlast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\n(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\nout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\ncleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\narrived at a resolution too.\nWe had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\nthen walked in the fields.\n\"I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,\" I said.\n\"Dear old Pip, old chap, you're a'most come round, sir.\"\n\"It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.\"\n\"Likeways for myself, sir,\" Joe returned.\n\"We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\ndays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\nforget these.\"\n\"Pip,\" said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, \"there has\nbeen larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us\u2014have been.\"\nAt night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done\nall through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well\nas in the morning?\n\"Yes, dear Joe, quite.\"\n\"And are always a getting stronger, old chap?\"\n\"Yes, dear Joe, steadily.\"\nJoe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and\nsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, \"Good night!\"\nWhen I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of\nmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before\nbreakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;\nfor, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and\nhe was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.\nI hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These\nwere its brief contents:\u2014\n\"Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear\nPip and will do better without\nJO.\n\"P.S. Ever the best of friends.\"\nEnclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I\nhad been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my\ncreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be\nquite recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe's having paid the money;\nbut Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.",

Mr. Pumblechook (not improved\nin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and\naddressed me in the following terms:\u2014\n\"Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be\nexpected! what else could be expected!\"\nAs he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I\nwas broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.\n\"William,\" said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, \"put a muffin on table.\nAnd has it come to this! Has it come to this!\"\nI frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me\nand poured out my tea\u2014before I could touch the teapot\u2014with the air of a\nbenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.\n\"William,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, \"put the salt on. In\nhappier times,\" addressing me, \"I think you took sugar? And did you\ntake milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said I, shortly, \"but I don't eat watercresses.\"\n\"You don't eat 'em,\" returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his\nhead several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if\nabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. \"True.\nThe simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn't bring any, William.\"\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand\nover me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\n\"Little more than skin and bone!\" mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. \"And\nyet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread\nafore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!\"\nThis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, \"May I?\"\nand the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\nsame fat five fingers.\n\"Hah!\" he went on, handing me the bread and butter. \"And air you\na-going to Joseph?\"\n\"In heaven's name,\" said I, firing in spite of myself, \"what does it\nmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.\"\nIt was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\nthe opportunity he wanted.\n\"Yes, young man,\" said he, releasing the handle of the article in\nquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, \"I _will_ leave that\nteapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I\nforgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to\nwish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of\nprodigygality, to be stimilated by the 'olesome nourishment of your\nforefathers. And yet,\" said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and\nwaiter, and pointing me out at arm's length, \"this is him as I ever\nsported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I\ntell you this is him!\"\nA low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\nparticularly affected.\n\"This is him,\" said Pumblechook, \"as I have rode in my shay-cart. This\nis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\nof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M'ria from\nher own mother, let him deny it if he can!\"\nThe waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\nthe case a black look.\n\"Young man,\" said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\nfashion, \"you air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask\nme, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to\nJoseph.\"\nThe waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\n\"Now,\" said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of\nsaying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\nconclusive, \"I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\nthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is\nWilliam, which his father's name was Potkins if I do not deceive\nmyself.\"\n\"You do not, sir,\" said William.\n\"In their presence,\" pursued Pumblechook, \"I will tell you, young man,\nwhat to say to Joseph. Says you, \"Joseph, I have this day seen my\nearliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun's. I will name no\nnames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\nseen that man.\"\n\"I swear I don't see him here,\" said I.\n\"Say that likewise,\" retorted Pumblechook. \"Say you said that, and even\nJoseph will probably betray surprise.\"\n\"There you quite mistake him,\" said I. \"I know better.\"\n\"Says you,\" Pumblechook went on, \"'Joseph, I have seen that man, and\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\ncharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\nignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\ngratitoode. Yes, Joseph,' says you,\" here Pumblechook shook his head\nand hand at me, \"'he knows my total deficiency of common human\ngratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,\nJoseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.'\"\nWindy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\nto talk thus to mine.\n\"Says you, 'Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\nrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\nProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\nplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode to\nhis earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's_. But that man said he\ndid not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to\ndo it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would\ndo it again.'\"\n\"It's pity,\" said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted\nbreakfast, \"that the man did not say what he had done and would do\nagain.\"\n\"Squires of the Boar!\" Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,\n\"and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town\nor down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do\nit, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.\"\nWith those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\nand left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by",

I went towards them slowly, for\nmy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew\nnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness\nfurther and further behind.\nThe June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were\nsoaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more\nbeautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many\npleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the\nchange for the better that would come over my character when I had a\nguiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I\nhad proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for\nmy heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass,\nthat I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,\nand whose wanderings had lasted many years.\nThe schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the\nlittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness'\nsake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a\nholiday; no children were there, and Biddy's house was closed. Some\nhopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties,\nbefore she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.\nBut the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it\nunder the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer.\nLong after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I\nheard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there,\nand the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and\ntheir leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the\nclink of Joe's hammer was not in the midsummer wind.\nAlmost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I\nsaw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no\nglittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and\nstill.\nBut the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to be in\nuse, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the\nwindow was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning\nto peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in\narm.",

How often, while he was with me\nin my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been\nhis knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!\n\"Dear Biddy,\" said I, \"you have the best husband in the whole world,\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would have\u2014But no, you\ncouldn't love him better than you do.\"\n\"No, I couldn't indeed,\" said Biddy.\n\"And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble\nJoe!\"\nJoe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before\nhis eyes.\n\"And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in\ncharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you\nhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid!

Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter\nnight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\never. Don't tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell him, Biddy,\nthat I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured you\nboth, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child,\nI said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I\ndid.\"\n\"I ain't a-going,\" said Joe, from behind his sleeve, \"to tell him\nnothink o' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't.\"\n\"And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind\nhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you\nsay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and\nthen I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better\nof me, in the time to come!\"\n\"O dear old Pip, old chap,\" said Joe. \"God knows as I forgive you, if I\nhave anythink to forgive!\"\n\"Amen! And God knows I do!\" echoed Biddy.\n\"Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few\nminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go\nwith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say\ngood-bye!\"",

            "text": "The early dinner hour at Joe's, left me abundance of time, without\nhurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.\nBut, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think\nof old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.\nThere was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the\nwall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a\nrough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had\nstruck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A\ngate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.\nA cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet\nup to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the\nmoon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where\nevery part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,\nand where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was\nlooking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure\nin it.\nThe figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving\ntowards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the\nfigure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away,\nwhen it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if\nmuch surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,\u2014\n\"Estella!\"\n\"I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.\"\nThe freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable\nmajesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,\nI had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,\nsoftened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was\nthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand.\nWe sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, \"After so many years,\nit is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our\nfirst meeting was! Do you often come back?\"\n\"I have never been here since.\"\n\"Nor I.\"\nThe moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white\nceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought\nof the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had\nheard on earth.\nEstella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.\n\"I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been\nprevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!\"\nThe silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and\nthe same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing\nthat I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she\nsaid quietly,\u2014\n\"Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in\nthis condition?\"\n\"Yes, Estella.\"\n\"The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not\nrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I\nhave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I\nmade in all the wretched years.\"\n\"Is it to be built on?\"\n\"At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And\nyou,\" she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,\u2014\"you\nlive abroad still?\"\n\"Still.\"\n\"And do well, I am sure?\"\n\"I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore\u2014yes, I do\nwell.\"\n\"I have often thought of you,\" said Estella.\n\"Have you?\"\n\"Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from\nme the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant\nof its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the\nadmission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.\"\n\"You have always held your place in my heart,\" I answered.\nAnd we were silent again until she spoke.\n\"I little thought,\" said Estella, \"that I should take leave of you in\ntaking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.\"\n\"Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,\nthe remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and\npainful.\"\n\"But you said to me,\" returned Estella, very earnestly, \"'God bless\nyou, God forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will\nnot hesitate to say that to me now,\u2014now, when suffering has been\nstronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what\nyour heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but\u2014I hope\u2014into a\nbetter shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me\nwe are friends.\"\n\"We are friends,\" said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from\nthe bench.\n\"And will continue friends apart,\" said Estella.\nI took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as\nthe morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so\nthe evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of\ntranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting\nfrom her.",
