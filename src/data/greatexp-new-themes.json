So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.\nI give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his\ntombstone and my sister,\u2014Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.\nAs I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of\neither of them (for their days were long before the days of\nphotographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were\nunreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on\nmy father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,\nwith curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,\n\"_Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_,\" I drew a childish conclusion that\nmy mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each\nabout a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside\ntheir grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of\nmine,\u2014who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that\nuniversal struggle,\u2014I am indebted for a belief I religiously\nentertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands\nin their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state\nof existence.\nOurs was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river\nwound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad\nimpression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on\na memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out\nfor certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the\nchurchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also\nGeorgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,\nBartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the\naforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness\nbeyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates,\nwith scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low\nleaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from\nwhich the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of\nshivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.",

A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and\nlamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by\nbriars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose\nteeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.\n\"Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir,\" I pleaded in terror. \"Pray don't do it,\nsir.\"\n\"Tell us your name!\" said the man. \"Quick!\"\n\"Pip, sir.\"\n\"Once more,\" said the man, staring at me. \"Give it mouth!\"\n\"Pip. Pip, sir.\"\n\"Show us where you live,\" said the man. \"Pint out the place!\"\nI pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the\nalder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and\nemptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.\nWhen the church came to itself,\u2014for he was so sudden and strong that he\nmade it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my\nfeet,\u2014when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high\ntombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.\n[Illustration]\n\"You young dog,\" said the man, licking his lips, \"what fat cheeks you\nha' got.\"\nI believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my\nyears, and not strong.\n\"Darn me if I couldn't eat 'em,\" said the man, with a threatening shake\nof his head, \"and if I han't half a mind to't!\"\nI earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the\ntombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;\npartly, to keep myself from crying.\n\"Now lookee here!\" said the man. \"Where's your mother?\"\n\"There, sir!\" said I.\nHe started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\n\"There, sir!\" I timidly explained. \"Also Georgiana. That's my mother.\"\n\"Oh!\" said he, coming back. \"And is that your father alonger your\nmother?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said I; \"him too; late of this parish.\"\n\"Ha!\" he muttered then, considering. \"Who d'ye live with,\u2014supposin'\nyou're kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?\"\n\"My sister, sir,\u2014Mrs. Joe Gargery,\u2014wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,\nsir.\"\n\"Blacksmith, eh?\" said he. And looked down at his leg.\nAfter darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to\nmy tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he\ncould hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,\nand mine looked most helplessly up into his.\n\"Now lookee here,\" he said, \"the question being whether you're to be\nlet to live. You know what a file is?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"And you know what wittles is?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger.\n\"You get me a file.\" He tilted me again. \"And you get me wittles.\" He\ntilted me again. \"You bring 'em both to me.\" He tilted me again. \"Or\nI'll have your heart and liver out.\" He tilted me again.\nI was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\nhands, and said, \"If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\nsir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.\"\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\nover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\nposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:\u2014\n\"You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\nbring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and\nyou never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your\nhaving seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall\nbe let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no\nmatter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore\nout, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am.\nThere's a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I\nam a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has\na secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his\nheart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide\nhimself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in\nbed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think\nhimself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and\ncreep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young man\nfrom harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I\nfind it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what\ndo you say?\"\nI said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\nbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\nthe morning.\n\"Say Lord strike you dead if you don't!\" said the man.\nI said so, and he took me down.\n\"Now,\" he pursued, \"you remember what you've undertook, and you\nremember that young man, and you get home!\"\n\"Goo-good night, sir,\" I faltered.\n\"Much of that!\" said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. \"I\nwish I was a frog. Or a eel!\"\nAt the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his\narms,\u2014clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,\u2014and limped\ntowards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the\nnettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked\nin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,\nstretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his\nankle and pull him in.\nWhen he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose\nlegs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When\nI saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of\nmy legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on\nagain towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and\npicking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into\nthe marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were\nheavy or the tide was in.\nThe marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped\nto look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not\nnearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long\nangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the\nriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the\nprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the\nbeacon by which the sailors steered,\u2014like an unhooped cask upon a\npole,\u2014an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with\nsome chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was\nlimping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,\nand come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a\nterrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their\nheads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I\nlooked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of",

He was a mild,\ngood-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,\u2014a sort\nof Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing\nredness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible\nshe washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall\nand bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her\nfigure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in\nfront, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful\nmerit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this\napron so much.

The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe\u2014I\nnever thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the\nhousekeeping property as his\u2014united to the necessity of always keeping\none hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about\nthe kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,\nas the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the\nvoice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to\nsecrecy, declaring that he couldn't and wouldn't starve until\nto-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the\nyoung man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his\nhands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should\nmistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and\nliver to-night, instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody's hair stood on\nend with terror, mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody's\never did?\nIt was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with\na copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with\nthe load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the\nload on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the\nbread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped\naway, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.\n\"Hark!\" said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final\nwarm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; \"was that great\nguns, Joe?\"\n\"Ah!\" said Joe. \"There's another conwict off.\"\n\"What does that mean, Joe?\" said I.\nMrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,\n\"Escaped. Escaped.\" Administering the definition like Tar-water.\nWhile Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my\nmouth into the forms of saying to Joe, \"What's a convict?\" Joe put\n_his_ mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer,\nthat I could make out nothing of it but the single word \"Pip.\"\n\"There was a conwict off last night,\" said Joe, aloud, \"after\nsunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they're\nfiring warning of another.\"\n\"_Who's_ firing?\" said I.\n\"Drat that boy,\" interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,\n\"what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you'll be told no\nlies.\"\nIt was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be\ntold lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite\nunless there was company.\nAt this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost\npains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a\nword that looked to me like \"sulks.\" Therefore, I naturally pointed to\nMrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, \"her?\" But Joe\nwouldn't hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,\nand shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make\nnothing of the word.\n\"Mrs. Joe,\" said I, as a last resort, \"I should like to know\u2014if you\nwouldn't much mind\u2014where the firing comes from?\"\n\"Lord bless the boy!\" exclaimed my sister, as if she didn't quite mean\nthat but rather the contrary. \"From the Hulks!\"\n\"Oh-h!\" said I, looking at Joe. \"Hulks!\"\nJoe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, \"Well, I told you so.\"\n\"And please, what's Hulks?\" said I.\n\"That's the way with this boy!\" exclaimed my sister, pointing me out\nwith her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. \"Answer him one\nquestion, and he'll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,\nright 'cross th' meshes.\" We always used that name for marshes, in our\ncountry.\n\"I wonder who's put into prison-ships, and why they're put there?\" said\nI, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.\nIt was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. \"I tell you what,\nyoung fellow,\" said she, \"I didn't bring you up by hand to badger\npeople's lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.\nPeople are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,\nand forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking\nquestions. Now, you get along to bed!\"\nI was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went\nupstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,\u2014from Mrs. Joe's thimble\nhaving played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,\u2014I\nfelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were\nhandy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking\nquestions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.\nSince that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought\nthat few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.\nNo matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in\nmortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in\nmortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal\nterror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had\nno hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me\nat every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on\nrequirement, in the secrecy of my terror.",

It wasn't\nfor myself I took it!\" Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of\nsmoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and\na flourish of his tail.\nAll this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I\nwent, I couldn't warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted,\nas the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet.

However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last\ntoo far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the\nriver-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes\nthat staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I\nhad just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and\nhad just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man\nsitting before me. His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded,\nand was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.\nI thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,\nin that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on\nthe shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but\nanother man!\nAnd yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great iron\non his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that\nthe other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat\nbroad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for\nI had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at\nme,\u2014it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself\ndown, for it made him stumble,\u2014and then he ran into the mist, stumbling\ntwice as he went, and I lost him.",

When?\"\n\"Just now.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"Yonder,\" said I, pointing; \"over there, where I found him nodding\nasleep, and thought it was you.\"\nHe held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his\nfirst idea about cutting my throat had revived.\n\"Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,\" I explained, trembling;\n\"and\u2014and\"\u2014I was very anxious to put this delicately\u2014\"and with\u2014the same\nreason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn't you hear the cannon last\nnight?\"\n\"Then there _was_ firing!\" he said to himself.\n\"I wonder you shouldn't have been sure of that,\" I returned, \"for we\nheard it up at home, and that's farther away, and we were shut in\nbesides.\"\n\"Why, see now!\" said he. \"When a man's alone on these flats, with a\nlight head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears\nnothin' all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees\nthe soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried\nafore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself\nchallenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders 'Make\nready! Present! Cover him steady, men!' and is laid hands on\u2014and\nthere's nothin'! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night\u2014coming up\nin order, Damn 'em, with their tramp, tramp\u2014I see a hundred. And as to\nfiring! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad\nday,\u2014But this man\"; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my\nbeing there; \"did you notice anything in him?\"",

      "text": "I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me\nup. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet\nbeen made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the\nhouse ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon\nthe kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,\u2014an article into\nwhich his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was\nvigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.\n\"And where the deuce ha' _you_ been?\" was Mrs. Joe's Christmas\nsalutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.\nI said I had been down to hear the Carols. \"Ah! well!\" observed Mrs.\nJoe. \"You might ha' done worse.\" Not a doubt of that I thought.\n\"Perhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's wife, and (what's the same thing) a\nslave with her apron never off, _I_ should have been to hear the\nCarols,\" said Mrs. Joe. \"I'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and\nthat's the best of reasons for my never hearing any.\"\nJoe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had\nretired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a\nconciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her\neyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and\nexhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.\nThis was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for\nweeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to\ntheir legs.\nWe were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork\nand greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had\nbeen made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not\nbeing missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive\narrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of\nbreakfast; \"for I ain't,\" said Mrs. Joe,\u2014\"I ain't a-going to have no\nformal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got\nbefore me, I promise you!\"\nSo, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on\na forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of\nmilk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the\ndresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and\ntacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the\nold one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,\nwhich was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the\nyear in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four\nlittle white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black\nnose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of\nthe other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite\nart of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than\ndirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the\nsame by their religion.\nMy sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that\nis to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a\nwell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he\nwas more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.\nNothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and\neverything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive\noccasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,\nthe picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,\nI think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young\noffender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and\ndelivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged\nmajesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being\nborn in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,\nand against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I\nwas taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make\nthem like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the\nfree use of my limbs.\nJoe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle\nfor compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to\nwhat I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.\nJoe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be\nequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\ndone. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the\nChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\nterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived\nthe idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman\nsaid, \"Ye are now to declare it!\" would be the time for me to rise and\npropose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure\nthat I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to\nthis extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.\nMr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble\nthe wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe's uncle,\nbut Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in\nthe nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was\nhalf-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and\nMrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked\n(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and\neverything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.",

My sister\nwas uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally\nmore gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I\nremember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,\nwho held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married\nMr. Hubble,\u2014I don't know at what remote period,\u2014when she was much\nyounger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,\nstooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs\nextraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some\nmiles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.\nAmong this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't\nrobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and\nthe Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to\nspeak (I didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the\nscaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure\ncorners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason\nto be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have\nleft me alone. But they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think\nthe opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,\nevery now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an\nunfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched\nup by these moral goads.\nIt began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\ntheatrical declamation,\u2014as it now appears to me, something like a\nreligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,\u2014and\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\nUpon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\nreproachful voice, \"Do you hear that? Be grateful.\"\n\"Especially,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"be grateful, boy, to them which\nbrought you up by hand.\"\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\npresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, \"Why is it that the\nyoung are never grateful?\" This moral mystery seemed too much for the\ncompany until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, \"Naterally\nwicious.\" Everybody then murmured \"True!\" and looked at me in a\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.",

The gluttony of Swine is put\nbefore us, as an example to the young.\" (I thought this pretty well in\nhim who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)\n\"What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.\"\n\"Or girl,\" suggested Mr. Hubble.\n\"Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,\" assented Mr. Wopsle, rather\nirritably, \"but there is no girl present.\"\n\"Besides,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, \"think what\nyou've got to be grateful for. If you'd been born a Squeaker\u2014\"\n\"He _was_, if ever a child was,\" said my sister, most emphatically.\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\n\"Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,\" said Mr. Pumblechook. \"If\nyou had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you\u2014\"\n\"Unless in that form,\" said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.\n\"But I don't mean in that form, sir,\" returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had\nan objection to being interrupted; \"I mean, enjoying himself with his\nelders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and\nrolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he\nwouldn't. And what would have been your destination?\" turning on me\nagain. \"You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according\nto the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would\nhave come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped\nyou under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his\nfrock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would\nhave shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then.\nNot a bit of it!\"\nJoe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.\n\"He was a world of trouble to you, ma'am,\" said Mrs. Hubble,\ncommiserating my sister.\n\"Trouble?\" echoed my sister; \"trouble?\" and then entered on a fearful\ncatalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts\nof sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled\nfrom, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I\nhad done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I\nhad contumaciously refused to go there.\nI think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with\ntheir noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in\nconsequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during\nthe recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it\nuntil he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in\ncomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the\npause was broken which ensued upon my sister's recital, and in which\npause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with\nindignation and abhorrence.\n\"Yet,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the\ntheme from which they had strayed, \"Pork\u2014regarded as biled\u2014is rich,\ntoo; ain't it?\"\n\"Have a little brandy, uncle,\" said my sister.\nO Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say\nit was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under\nthe cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.\nMy sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,\nand poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man\ntrifled with his glass,\u2014took it up, looked at it through the light, put\nit down,\u2014prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were\nbriskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.\nI couldn't keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the\ntable with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his\nglass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the\nbrandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with\nunspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning\nround several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and\nrushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,\nviolently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces,\nand apparently out of his mind.\nI held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn't know how I\nhad done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my\ndreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and\nsurveying the company all round as if _they_ had disagreed with him,\nsank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, \"Tar!\"\nI had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be\nworse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day,\nby the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.\n\"Tar!\" cried my sister, in amazement. \"Why, how ever could Tar come\nthere?\"\nBut, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't\nhear the word, wouldn't hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all\naway with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had\nbegun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in\ngetting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and\nmixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on\nto the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of\ngratitude.",

She drew a pitcher of beer\nfrom the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a\nglass of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, \"Give him wine,\nMum. I'll engage there's no tar in that:\" so, the sergeant thanked him\nand said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take\nwine, if it was equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his\nMajesty's health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a\nmouthful and smacked his lips.\n\"Good stuff, eh, sergeant?\" said Mr. Pumblechook.\n\"I'll tell you something,\" returned the sergeant; \"I suspect that\nstuff's of _your_ providing.\"\nMr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, \"Ay, ay? Why?\"\n\"Because,\" returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, \"you're\na man that knows what's what.\"\n\"D'ye think so?\" said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. \"Have\nanother glass!\"\n\"With you. Hob and nob,\" returned the sergeant. \"The top of mine to the\nfoot of yours,\u2014the foot of yours to the top of mine,\u2014Ring once, ring\ntwice,\u2014the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live\na thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you\nare at the present moment of your life!\"\nThe sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for\nanother glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality\nappeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the\nbottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a\ngush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine\nthat he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with\nthe same liberality, when the first was gone.\nAs I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,\nenjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a\ndinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed\nthemselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened\nwith the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively\nanticipation of \"the two villains\" being taken, and when the bellows\nseemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke\nto hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and\nall the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the\nblaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale\nafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have\nturned pale on their account, poor wretches.\nAt last, Joe's job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As\nJoe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us\nshould go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr.\nPumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies'\nsociety; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was\nagreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should\nhave got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe's curiosity to know\nall about it and how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, \"If\nyou bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don't\nlook to me to put it together again.\"\nThe sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.\nPumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully\nsensible of that gentleman's merits under arid conditions, as when\nsomething moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.\nMr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and\nto speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in\nthe raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I\ntreasonably whispered to Joe, \"I hope, Joe, we shan't find them.\" and\nJoe whispered to me, \"I'd give a shilling if they had cut and run,\nPip.\"\nWe were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was\ncold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming\non, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day.

We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.\nThere we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant's\nhand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the\ngraves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding\nanything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate\nat the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us\nhere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\nNow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\nthought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\nhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\ncome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\nhad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\nimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\nhunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\ntreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\nIt was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe's\nback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a\nhunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and\nto keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a\npretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking\nthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.\nEither the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.\nUnder the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the\nmound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,\nthough all of a watery lead colour.\nWith my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe's broad shoulder, I\nlooked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I\ncould hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by\nhis blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\nstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\nsheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;\nand the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\nthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.",

As we came nearer to the shouting, it became\nmore and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.\nSometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.\nWhen it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate\nthan ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,\nthat we could hear one voice calling \"Murder!\" and another voice,\n\"Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!\" Then\nboth voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would\nbreak out again. And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like\ndeer, and Joe too.\nThe sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and\ntwo of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and\nlevelled when we all ran in.\n\"Here are both men!\" panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a\nditch. \"Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come\nasunder!\"\nWater was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn,\nand blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the\nditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and\nthe other one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and\nstruggling; but of course I knew them both directly.\n\"Mind!\" said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged\nsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: \"_I_ took him! _I_\ngive him up to you! Mind that!\"\n\"It's not much to be particular about,\" said the sergeant; \"it'll do\nyou small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs\nthere!\"\n\"I don't expect it to do me any good. I don't want it to do me more\ngood than it does now,\" said my convict, with a greedy laugh. \"I took\nhim. He knows it. That's enough for me.\"\nThe other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old\nbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.\nHe could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both\nseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\nfalling.\n\"Take notice, guard,\u2014he tried to murder me,\" were his first words.\n\"Tried to murder him?\" said my convict, disdainfully. \"Try, and not do\nit? I took him, and giv' him up; that's what I done. I not only\nprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,\u2014dragged\nhim this far on his way back. He's a gentleman, if you please, this\nvillain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder\nhim? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag\nhim back!\"\nThe other one still gasped, \"He tried\u2014he tried-to\u2014murder me. Bear\u2014bear\nwitness.\"\n\"Lookee here!\" said my convict to the sergeant. \"Single-handed I got\nclear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha' got\nclear of these death-cold flats likewise\u2014look at my leg: you won't find\nmuch iron on it\u2014if I hadn't made the discovery that _he_ was here. Let\n_him_ go free? Let _him_ profit by the means as I found out? Let _him_\nmake a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had\ndied at the bottom there,\" and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch\nwith his manacled hands, \"I'd have held to him with that grip, that you\nshould have been safe to find him in my hold.\"\nThe other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his\ncompanion, repeated, \"He tried to murder me.

I defy him to do it.\"\nThe other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not,\nhowever, collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set\nexpression, looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and\nat the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.\n\"Do you see him?\" pursued my convict. \"Do you see what a villain he is?\nDo you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That's how he looked\nwhen we were tried together. He never looked at me.\"\nThe other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes\nrestlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment\non the speaker, with the words, \"You are not much to look at,\" and with\na half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict\nbecame so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him\nbut for the interposition of the soldiers. \"Didn't I tell you,\" said\nthe other convict then, \"that he would murder me, if he could?\" And any\none could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon\nhis lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.\n\"Enough of this parley,\" said the sergeant. \"Light those torches.\"\nAs one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went\ndown on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first\ntime, and saw me. I had alighted from Joe's back on the brink of the\nditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly\nwhen he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I\nhad been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my\ninnocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended\nmy intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it\nall passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a\nday, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having\nbeen more attentive.\nThe soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four\ntorches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been\nalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards\nvery dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in\na ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches\nkindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the\nopposite bank of the river. \"All right,\" said the sergeant. \"March.\"\nWe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. \"You are expected\non board,\" said the sergeant to my convict; \"they know you are coming.\nDon't straggle, my man. Close up here.\"\nThe two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate\nguard. I had hold of Joe's hand now, and Joe carried one of the\ntorches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to\nsee it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good\npath now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and\nthere where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy\nsluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming\nin after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon\nthe track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I\ncould see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air\nabout us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather\nto like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We\ncould not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,\nthat two or three times we had to halt while they rested.\nAfter an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut\nand a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,\nand the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was\na smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a\nstand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\novergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a\ndozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in\ntheir great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their\nheads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant\nmade some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the\nconvict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,\nto go on board first.\nMy convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the\nhut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up\nhis feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if\nhe pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the\nsergeant, and remarked,\u2014\n\"I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some\npersons laying under suspicion alonger me.\"\n\"You can say what you like,\" returned the sergeant, standing coolly\nlooking at him with his arms folded, \"but you have no call to say it\nhere. You'll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about\nit, before it's done with, you know.\"\n\"I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can't\nstarve; at least _I_ can't. I took some wittles, up at the willage over\nyonder,\u2014where the church stands a'most out on the marshes.\"\n\"You mean stole,\" said the sergeant.\n\"And I'll tell you where from. From the blacksmith's.\"\n\"Halloa!\" said the sergeant, staring at Joe.\n\"Halloa, Pip!\" said Joe, staring at me.\n\"It was some broken wittles\u2014that's what it was\u2014and a dram of liquor,\nand a pie.\"\n\"Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?\" asked\nthe sergeant, confidentially.\n\"My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don't you know,\nPip?\"\n\"So,\" said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and\nwithout the least glance at me,\u2014\"so you're the blacksmith, are you?\nThan I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.\"\n\"God knows you're welcome to it,\u2014so far as it was ever mine,\" returned\nJoe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. \"We don't know what you\nhave done, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor\nmiserable fellow-creatur.\u2014Would us, Pip?\"\nThe something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man's throat\nagain, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard\nwere ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough\nstakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a\ncrew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or\ninterested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or\nspoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,\n\"Give way, you!\" which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the\nlight of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from\nthe mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah's ark. Cribbed and barred and\nmoored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes\nto be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we\nsaw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches\nwere flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over\nwith him.",

But I\nloved Joe,\u2014perhaps for no better reason in those early days than\nbecause the dear fellow let me love him,\u2014and, as to him, my inner self\nwas not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when\nI first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe\nthe whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted\nthat if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing\nJoe's confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at\nnight staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up\nmy tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I\nnever afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair\nwhisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe\nknew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at\nyesterday's meat or pudding when it came on to-day's table, without\nthinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry.

And he hammered at me with a wigor only to\nbe equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his\nanwil.\u2014You're a listening and understanding, Pip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\n\"Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several\ntimes; and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd say, \"Joe,\"\nshe'd say, \"now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,\" and\nshe'd put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that\nhe couldn't abear to be without us. So, he'd come with a most\ntremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where\nwe was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us\nand to give us up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us.\nWhich, you see, Pip,\" said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the\nfire, and looking at me, \"were a drawback on my learning.\"\n\"Certainly, poor Joe!\"\n\"Though mind you, Pip,\" said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the\npoker on the top bar, \"rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining\nequal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his\nhart, don't you see?\"\nI didn't see; but I didn't say so.\n\"Well!\" Joe pursued, \"somebody must keep the pot a-biling, Pip, or the\npot won't bile, don't you know?\"\nI saw that, and said so.\n\"Consequence, my father didn't make objections to my going to work; so\nI went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he would",

(I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better\nacquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a\nwedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human countenance.)\nWhen my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the\nstiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was\ntrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered\nover to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the\nSheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been\ndying to make all along: \"Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but\nespecially unto them which brought you up by hand!\"",

It appeared to me that he must be\na very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop;\nand I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and\nsaw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds\nand bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and\nbloom.\nIt was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this\nspeculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in\nan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the\nbedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\neyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\nbetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\nhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about the\ncorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and\nflavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I\nhardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for\nnoticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by\nlooking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact\n_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to\nget on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating\nthe baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,\nwho stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always\nporing over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and\nalways inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the\nglass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the\nHigh Street whose trade engaged his attention.\nMr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlour\nbehind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of\nbread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered\nMr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my\nsister's idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be\nimparted to my diet,\u2014besides giving me as much crumb as possible in\ncombination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm\nwater into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the\nmilk out altogether,\u2014his conversation consisted of nothing but\narithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,\npompously, \"Seven times nine, boy?\" And how should _I_ be able to\nanswer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I\nwas hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum\nthat lasted all through the breakfast. \"Seven?\" \"And four?\" \"And\neight?\" \"And six?\" \"And two?\" \"And ten?\" And so on. And after each\nfigure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a\nsup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,\nand eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)\na gorging and gormandizing manner.\nFor such reasons, I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started",

      "text": "for Miss Havisham's; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the\nmanner in which I should acquit myself under that lady's roof. Within a\nquarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham's house, which was of old\nbrick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the\nwindows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were\nrustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so\nwe had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to\nopen it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.\nPumblechook said, \"And fourteen?\" but I pretended not to hear him), and\nsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing\nwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\ntime.\nA window was raised, and a clear voice demanded \"What name?\" To which\nmy conductor replied, \"Pumblechook.\" The voice returned, \"Quite right,\"\nand the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the\ncourt-yard, with keys in her hand.\n\"This,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"is Pip.\"\n\"This is Pip, is it?\" returned the young lady, who was very pretty and\nseemed very proud; \"come in, Pip.\"\nMr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.\n\"Oh!\" she said. \"Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?\"\n\"If Miss Havisham wished to see me,\" returned Mr. Pumblechook,\ndiscomfited.\n\"Ah!\" said the girl; \"but you see she don't.\"\nShe said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.\nPumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not\nprotest. But he eyed me severely,\u2014as if _I_ had done anything to\nhim!\u2014and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: \"Boy! Let\nyour behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by\nhand!\" I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to\npropound through the gate, \"And sixteen?\" But he didn't.\nMy young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.\nIt was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The\nbrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the\nwooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood\nopen, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.\nThe cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it\nmade a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the\nbrewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.\nShe saw me looking at it, and she said, \"You could drink without hurt\nall the strong beer that's brewed there now, boy.\"\n\"I should think I could, miss,\" said I, in a shy way.\n\"Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;\ndon't you think so?\"\n\"It looks like it, miss.\"\n\"Not that anybody means to try,\" she added, \"for that's all done with,\nand the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong\nbeer, there's enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor\nHouse.\"\n[Illustration]\n\"Is that the name of this house, miss?\"\n\"One of its names, boy.\"",

It meant, when it\nwas given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They\nmust have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But\ndon't loiter, boy.\"\nThough she called me \"boy\" so often, and with a carelessness that was\nfar from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much\nolder than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and\nself-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been\none-and-twenty, and a queen.\nWe went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two\nchains across it outside,\u2014and the first thing I noticed was, that the\npassages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.\nShe took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,\nand still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.\nAt last we came to the door of a room, and she said, \"Go in.\"\nI answered, more in shyness than politeness, \"After you, miss.\"\nTo this she returned: \"Don't be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.\"\nAnd scornfully walked away, and\u2014what was worse\u2014took the candle with\nher.\nThis was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only\nthing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told\nfrom within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a\npretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of\ndaylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed\nfrom the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite\nunknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded\nlooking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady's\ndressing-table.\nWhether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\nfine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow\nresting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the\nstrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\nShe was dressed in rich materials,\u2014satins, and lace, and silks,\u2014all of\nwhite. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent\nfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was\nwhite. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and\nsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid\nthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.\nShe had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,\u2014the\nother was on the table near her hand,\u2014her veil was but half arranged,\nher watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay\nwith those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some\nflowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the\nlooking-glass.",

But I\nsaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been\nwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw\nthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and\nlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\nsunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\nof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\nshrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly\nwaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage\nlying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\nto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\na vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to\nhave dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if\nI could.\n\"Who is it?\" said the lady at the table.\n\"Pip, ma'am.\"\n\"Pip?\"\n\"Mr. Pumblechook's boy, ma'am. Come\u2014to play.\"\n\"Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close.\"\nIt was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of\nthe surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped\nat twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at\ntwenty minutes to nine.\n\"Look at me,\" said Miss Havisham. \"You are not afraid of a woman who\nhas never seen the sun since you were born?\"\nI regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie\ncomprehended in the answer \"No.\"\n\"Do you know what I touch here?\" she said, laying her hands, one upon\nthe other, on her left side.\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" (It made me think of the young man.)\n\"What do I touch?\"\n\"Your heart.\"\n\"Broken!\"\nShe uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and\nwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept\nher hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if\nthey were heavy.\n\"I am tired,\" said Miss Havisham. \"I want diversion, and I have done\nwith men and women. Play.\"\nI think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she\ncould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the\nwide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.\n\"I sometimes have sick fancies,\" she went on, \"and I have a sick fancy\nthat I want to see some play. There, there!\" with an impatient movement\nof the fingers of her right hand; \"play, play, play!\"\nFor a moment, with the fear of my sister's working me before my eyes, I\nhad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed\ncharacter of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart. But I felt myself so\nunequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss\nHavisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as\nshe said, when we had taken a good look at each other,\u2014\n\"Are you sullen and obstinate?\"\n\"No, ma'am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can't play just\nnow. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so\nI would do it if I could; but it's so new here, and so strange, and so\nfine,\u2014and melancholy\u2014.\" I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had\nalready said it, and we took another look at each other.\nBefore she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the\ndress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in\nthe looking-glass.\n\"So new to him,\" she muttered, \"so old to me; so strange to him, so\nfamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.\"\nAs she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she\nwas still talking to herself, and kept quiet.\n\"Call Estella,\" she repeated, flashing a look at me. \"You can do that.\nCall Estella. At the door.\"\nTo stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,\nbawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor\nresponsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,\nwas almost as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and\nher light came along the dark passage like a star.\nMiss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the\ntable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\npretty brown hair. \"Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it\nwell. Let me see you play cards with this boy.\"\n\"With this boy? Why, he is a common labouring-boy!\"\nI thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,\u2014only it seemed so\nunlikely,\u2014\"Well?

So we sat down to cards.\nIt was then I began to understand that everything in the room had\nstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that\nMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\ntaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the\ndressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now\nyellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the\nshoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now\nyellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything,\nthis standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the\nwithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like\ngrave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.\nSo she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\ntrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew\nnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies\nburied in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being\ndistinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have\nlooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have\nstruck her to dust.\n\"He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!\" said Estella with disdain,\nbefore our first game was out. \"And what coarse hands he has! And what\nthick boots!\"\nI had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to\nconsider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so\nstrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.\nShe won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I\nknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for\na stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.\n\"You say nothing of her,\" remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked\non. \"She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What\ndo you think of her?\"\n\"I don't like to say,\" I stammered.\n\"Tell me in my ear,\" said Miss Havisham, bending down.\n\"I think she is very proud,\" I replied, in a whisper.\n\"Anything else?\"\n\"I think she is very pretty.\"\n\"Anything else?\"\n\"I think she is very insulting.\" (She was looking at me then with a\nlook of supreme aversion.)\n\"Anything else?\"\n\"I think I should like to go home.\"\n\"And never see her again, though she is so pretty?\"\n\"I am not sure that I shouldn't like to see her again, but I should\nlike to go home now.\"\n\"You shall go soon,\" said Miss Havisham, aloud. \"Play the game out.\"\nSaving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure\nthat Miss Havisham's face could not smile. It had dropped into a\nwatchful and brooding expression,\u2014most likely when all the things about\nher had become transfixed,\u2014and it looked as if nothing could ever lift\nit up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice\nhad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;\naltogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,\nwithin and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.\nI played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She\nthrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she\ndespised them for having been won of me.\n\"When shall I have you here again?\" said Miss Havisham. \"Let me think.\"\nI was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she",

Come again after six days. You hear?\"\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\"Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him\nroam and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.\"\nI followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she\nstood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the side\nentrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must\nnecessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded\nme, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange\nroom many hours.\n\"You are to wait here, you boy,\" said Estella; and disappeared and\nclosed the door.\nI took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my\ncoarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was\nnot favourable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me\nnow, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever\ntaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called\nknaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and\nthen I should have been so too.\nShe came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She\nput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and\nmeat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in\ndisgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,\u2014I\ncannot hit upon the right name for the smart\u2014God knows what its name\nwas,\u2014that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the\ngirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of\nthem. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she\ngave a contemptuous toss\u2014but with a sense, I thought, of having made\ntoo sure that I was so wounded\u2014and left me.\nBut when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face\nin, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my\nsleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.\nAs I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so\nbitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,\nthat needed counteraction.\nMy sister's bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in\nwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be\nonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is\nsmall, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many\nhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within\nmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with\ninjustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my\nsister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had\ncherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave\nher no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments,\ndisgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had\nnursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a\nsolitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was\nmorally timid and very sensitive.\nI got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\nbrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my\nface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat\nwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon\nin spirits to look about me.\nTo be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the\nbrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\nwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there\nhad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no\npigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,\nno malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper\nor the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have\nevaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a\nwilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of\nbetter days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as\na sample of the beer that was gone,\u2014and in this respect I remember\nthose recluses as being like most others.\nBehind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\nwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\nto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\nhouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\na track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes\nwalked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But\nshe seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation\npresented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking\non them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,\nand held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never\nlooked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery\nitself,\u2014by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used\nto make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I\nfirst went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the\ndoor looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and\nascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,\nas if she were going out into the sky.\nIt was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\nto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\nstranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes\u2014a little dimmed by\nlooking up at the frosty light\u2014towards a great wooden beam in a low\nnook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\nhanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one\nshoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\nMiss Havisham's, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\nshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and\nin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\nbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\nwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.\nNothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of\npeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving\ninfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have\nbrought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself\nas soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to\nlet me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I\nthought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.\nShe gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that\nmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the\ngate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,\nwhen she touched me with a taunting hand.\n\"Why don't you cry?\"\n\"Because I don't want to.\"\n\"You do,\" said she. \"You have been crying till you are half blind, and\nyou are near crying again now.\"\nShe laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.\nI went straight to Mr. Pumblechook's, and was immensely relieved to\nfind him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I\nwas wanted at Miss Havisham's again, I set off on the four-mile walk to\nour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply\nrevolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;\nthat my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of\ncalling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had\nconsidered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived",

Towards\nJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\ndebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham's\nacquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would \"do\nsomething\" for me; their doubts related to the form that something\nwould take. My sister stood out for \"property.\" Mr. Pumblechook was in\nfavour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel\ntrade,\u2014say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the\ndeepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I\nmight only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the\nveal-cutlets. \"If a fool's head can't express better opinions than\nthat,\" said my sister, \"and you have got any work to do, you had better\ngo and do it.\" So he went.\nAfter Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing\nup, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had\ndone for the night. Then I said, \"Before the fire goes out, Joe, I\nshould like to tell you something.\"\n\"Should you, Pip?\" said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\n\"Then tell us. What is it, Pip?\"\n\"Joe,\" said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\nit between my finger and thumb, \"you remember all that about Miss\nHavisham's?\"\n\"Remember?\" said Joe. \"I believe you! Wonderful!\"\n\"It's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true.\"\n\"What are you telling of, Pip?\" cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\namazement. \"You don't mean to say it's\u2014\"\n\"Yes I do; it's lies, Joe.\"\n\"But not all of it? Why sure you don't mean to say, Pip, that there was\nno black welwet co\u2014eh?\" For, I stood shaking my head. \"But at least\nthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,\" said Joe, persuasively, \"if there\nwarn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?\"\n\"No, Joe.\"\n\"A dog?\" said Joe. \"A puppy? Come?\"\n\"No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.\"\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\n\"Pip, old chap! This won't do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect\nto go to?\"\n\"It's terrible, Joe; ain't it?\"\n\"Terrible?\" cried Joe. \"Awful! What possessed you?\"\n\"I don't know what possessed me, Joe,\" I replied, letting his shirt\nsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\n\"but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\nwish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.\"\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been\nable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\nme, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's\nwho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that\nI knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the\nlies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.\nThis was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\nwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\nmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\n\"There's one thing you may be sure of, Pip,\" said Joe, after some\nrumination, \"namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn't\nought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\nthe same. Don't you tell no more of 'em, Pip. _That_ ain't the way to\nget out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don't make\nit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You're oncommon\nsmall. Likewise you're a oncommon scholar.\"\n\"No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.\"\n\"Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I've\nseen letters\u2014Ah! and from gentlefolks!\u2014that I'll swear weren't wrote in\nprint,\" said Joe.\n\"I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It's only\nthat.\"\n\"Well, Pip,\" said Joe, \"be it so or be it son't, you must be a common\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\nhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can't sit and write his acts of\nParliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\nPrince, with the alphabet.\u2014Ah!\" added Joe, with a shake of the head\nthat was full of meaning, \"and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\nAnd _I_ know what that is to do, though I can't say I've exactly done\nit.\"\nThere was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\nme.\n\"Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,\" pursued Joe,\nreflectively, \"mightn't be the better of continuing for to keep company\nwith common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\nones,\u2014which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?\"\n\"No, Joe.\"\n\"(I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\nmightn't be, is a thing as can't be looked into now, without putting\nyour sister on the Rampage; and that's a thing not to be thought of as\nbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a\ntrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can't get to\nbe oncommon through going straight, you'll never get to do it through\ngoing crooked.

      "text": "The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,\nthat the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to\nget out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous\nconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's\ngreat-aunt's at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to\nget on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she\nwould impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging\nof girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her\npromise within five minutes.\nThe Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and\nput straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\ncollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\na birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,\nthe pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand\nto hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a\nlittle spelling,\u2014that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils\nthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the\nsubject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the\nhardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a\nrush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they\nhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more\nillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have\nsince met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various\nspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part\nof the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between\nBiddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave\nout the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,\u2014or\nwhat we couldn't\u2014in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,\nshrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or\nreverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had\nlasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt,\nwho staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was\nunderstood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into\nthe air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that\nthere was no prohibition against any pupil's entertaining himself with\na slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not\neasy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of\nthe little general shop in which the classes were holden\u2014and which was\nalso Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber\u2014being but\nfaintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle\nand no snuffers.\nIt appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under\nthese circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very\nevening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some\ninformation from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of\nmoist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D",

      "text": "Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe\nliked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders\nfrom my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that\nevening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the\nThree Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.\nThere was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk\nscores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to\nbe never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and\nhad grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our\ncountry, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it\nto account.\nIt being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at\nthese records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I\nmerely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the\nend of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and\nwhere Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a\nstranger. Joe greeted me as usual with \"Halloa, Pip, old chap!\" and the\nmoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.\nHe was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was\nall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\nmouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\nand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\nnodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\ndown there.\nBut as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\nresort, I said \"No, thank you, sir,\" and fell into the space Joe made\nfor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\nwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg\u2014in a very odd way, as\nit struck me.\n\"You was saying,\" said the strange man, turning to Joe, \"that you was a\nblacksmith.\"\n\"Yes. I said it, you know,\" said Joe.\n\"What'll you drink, Mr.\u2014? You didn't mention your name, by the bye.\"\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. \"What'll\nyou drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, \"to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of\ndrinking at anybody's expense but my own.\"\n\"Habit? No,\" returned the stranger, \"but once and away, and on a\nSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.\"\n\"I wouldn't wish to be stiff company,\" said Joe. \"Rum.\"\n\"Rum,\" repeated the stranger. \"And will the other gentleman originate a\nsentiment.\"\n\"Rum,\" said Mr. Wopsle.\n\"Three Rums!\" cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. \"Glasses\nround!\"\n\"This other gentleman,\" observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\n\"is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\nchurch.\"\n\"Aha!\" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. \"The\nlonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!\"\n\"That's it,\" said Joe.\nThe stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his\nlegs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\nbroad-brimmed traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over\nhis head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he\nlooked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\nhalf-laugh, come into his face.\n\"I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\nsolitary country towards the river.\"\n\"Most marshes is solitary,\" said Joe.\n\"No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\nvagrants of any sort, out there?\"\n\"No,\" said Joe; \"none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don't\nfind _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?\"\nMr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\nbut not warmly.\n\"Seems you have been out after such?\" asked the stranger.\n\"Once,\" returned Joe. \"Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;\nwe went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn't us,\nPip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\nThe stranger looked at me again,\u2014still cocking his eye, as if he were\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,\u2014and said, \"He's a\nlikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?\"\n\"Pip,\" said Joe.\n\"Christened Pip?\"\n\"No, not christened Pip.\"\n\"Surname Pip?\"\n\"No,\" said Joe, \"it's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\ninfant, and is called by.\"\n\"Son of yours?\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\nanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\nthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\ndiscussed over pipes,\u2014\"well\u2014no. No, he ain't.\"\n\"Nevvy?\" said the strange man.\n\"Well,\" said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, \"he\nis not\u2014no, not to deceive you, he is _not_\u2014my nevvy.\"\n\"What the Blue Blazes is he?\" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\nMr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about\nrelationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female\nrelations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and\nJoe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most\nterrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to\nthink he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, \"\u2014as\nthe poet says.\"\nAnd here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he\nconsidered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and\npoke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing\nwho visited at our house should always have put me through the same\ninflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to\nmind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our\nsocial family circle, but some large-handed person took some such\nophthalmic steps to patronise me.\nAll this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\ndown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\nshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\nIt was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\npointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at\nme, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it\nand he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with a\nfile_.\nHe did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe's\nfile, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\ninstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on\nhis settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally\nabout turnips.\nThere was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause\nbefore going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,\nwhich stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on\nSaturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water\nrunning out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.\n\"Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,\" said the strange man. \"I think I've\ngot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the\nboy shall have it.\"\nHe looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some\ncrumpled paper, and gave it to me. \"Yours!\" said he. \"Mind! Your own.\"\nI thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,\nand holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.\nWopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look\nwith his aiming eye,\u2014no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may\nbe done with an eye by hiding it.\nOn the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk must\nhave been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of\nthe Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide\nopen, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in a\nmanner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old\nacquaintance, and could think of nothing else.\nMy sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in\nthe kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to\ntell her about the bright shilling. \"A bad un, I'll be bound,\" said\nMrs. Joe triumphantly, \"or he wouldn't have given it to the boy! Let's\nlook at it.\"\nI took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. \"But what's\nthis?\" said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the\npaper. \"Two One-Pound notes?\"\nNothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to\nhave been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets\nin the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the\nJolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat\ndown on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty\nsure that the man would not be there.\nPresently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,\nJoe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.\nThen my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under\nsome dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in\nthe state parlour. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and\nmany a night and day.",

This\nwas my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been\nsome light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;\nbut, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of\ngarden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the\nwindow, as if it pelted me for coming there.\nI divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that\nits other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room\nexcept the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in\nall my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.\nThere were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had\nbeen standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me\nthat they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended\nnot to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the\nadmission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to\nbe a toady and humbug.",

The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\nemphatically, \"_Very_ true!\"\n\"Poor soul!\" Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been\nlooking at me in the mean time), \"he is so very strange! Would anyone\nbelieve that when Tom's wife died, he actually could not be induced to\nsee the importance of the children's having the deepest of trimmings to\ntheir mourning? 'Good Lord!' says he, 'Camilla, what can it signify so\nlong as the poor bereaved little things are in black?' So like Matthew!\nThe idea!\"\n\"Good points in him, good points in him,\" said Cousin Raymond; \"Heaven\nforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\nwill have, any sense of the proprieties.\"\n\"You know I was obliged,\" said Camilla,\u2014\"I was obliged to be firm. I\nsaid, 'It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.' I told him that,\nwithout deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\nbreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\nin his violent way, and said, with a D, 'Then do as you like.' Thank\nGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.\"\n\"_He_ paid for them, did he not?\" asked Estella.\n\"It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,\" returned\nCamilla. \"_I_ bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\nwhen I wake up in the night.\"\nThe ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\ncall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the\nconversation and caused Estella to say to me, \"Now, boy!\" On my turning\nround, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went\nout, I heard Sarah Pocket say, \"Well I am sure! What next!\" and Camilla\nadd, with indignation, \"Was there ever such a fancy! The i-d_e_-a!\"\nAs we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella\nstopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting\nmanner, with her face quite close to mine,\u2014\n\"Well?\"\n\"Well, miss?\" I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.\nShe stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.\n\"Am I pretty?\"\n\"Yes; I think you are very pretty.\"\n\"Am I insulting?\"\n\"Not so much so as you were last time,\" said I.\n\"Not so much so?\"\n\"No.\"\nShe fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face\nwith such force as she had, when I answered it.\n\"Now?\" said she. \"You little coarse monster, what do you think of me\nnow?\"\n\"I shall not tell you.\"\n\"Because you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?\"\n\"No,\" said I, \"that's not it.\"\n\"Why don't you cry again, you little wretch?\"\n\"Because I'll never cry for you again,\" said I. Which was, I suppose,\nas false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for\nher then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.\nWe went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going\nup, we met a gentleman groping his way down.\n\"Whom have we here?\" asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.\n\"A boy,\" said Estella.\nHe was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an\nexceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin\nin his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the\nlight of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head,\nand had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn't lie down but stood up\nbristling. His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were\ndisagreeably sharp and suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and\nstrong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he\nhad let them. He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight\nthen, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had\nthis opportunity of observing him well.\n\"Boy of the neighbourhood? Hey?\" said he.\n\"Yes, sir,\" said I.\n\"How do _you_ come here?\"\n\"Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,\" I explained.\n\"Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and\nyou're a bad set of fellows. Now mind!\" said he, biting the side of his\ngreat forefinger as he frowned at me, \"you behave yourself!\"\nWith those words, he released me\u2014which I was glad of, for his hand\nsmelt of scented soap\u2014and went his way downstairs. I wondered whether\nhe could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn't be a doctor, or he\nwould have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much\ntime to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham's room,\nwhere she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella\nleft me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham\ncast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table.\n\"So!\" she said, without being startled or surprised: \"the days have\nworn away, have they?\"\n\"Yes, ma'am. To-day is\u2014\"\n\"There, there, there!\" with the impatient movement of her fingers. \"I\ndon't want to know. Are you ready to play?\"\nI was obliged to answer in some confusion, \"I don't think I am, ma'am.\"\n\"Not at cards again?\" she demanded, with a searching look.\n\"Yes, ma'am; I could do that, if I was wanted.\"\n\"Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,\" said Miss Havisham,\nimpatiently, \"and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?\"\nI could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to\nfind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.\n\"Then go into that opposite room,\" said she, pointing at the door\nbehind me with her withered hand, \"and wait there till I come.\"\nI crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.\nFrom that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had\nan airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in\nthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\nto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed\ncolder than the clearer air,\u2014like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry\nbranches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the\nchamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its\ndarkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but\nevery discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and\ndropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a\ntablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the\nhouse and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece\nof some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily\noverhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,\nas I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its\nseeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with\nblotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some\ncircumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in\nthe spider community.\nI heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\noccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles\ntook no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a\nponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of\nhearing, and not on terms with one another.\nThese crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\nthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\nIn her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,\nand she looked like the Witch of the place.\n\"This,\" said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, \"is where\nI will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.\"\nWith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\nthere and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork\nat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\n\"What do you think that is?\" she asked me, again pointing with her\nstick; \"that, where those cobwebs are?\"\n\"I can't guess what it is, ma'am.\"\n\"It's a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!\"\nShe looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, \"Come, come, come!\nWalk me, walk me!\"\nI made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\nHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\nshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\nbeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\nPumblechook's chaise-cart.\nShe was not physically strong, and after a little time said, \"Slower!\"\nStill, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a\nwhile she said, \"Call Estella!\" so I went out on the landing and roared\nthat name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light\nappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\nand round the room.\nIf only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\nhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn't know\nwhat to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham\ntwitched my shoulder, and we posted on,\u2014with a shame-faced\nconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.\n\"Dear Miss Havisham,\" said Miss Sarah Pocket. \"How well you look!\"\n\"I do not,\" returned Miss Havisham. \"I am yellow skin and bone.\"\nCamilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she\nmurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, \"Poor dear\nsoul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!\"\n\"And how are _you_?\" said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to\nCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss\nHavisham wouldn't stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly\nobnoxious to Camilla.\n\"Thank you, Miss Havisham,\" she returned, \"I am as well as can be\nexpected.\"\n\"Why, what's the matter with you?\" asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\nsharpness.\n\"Nothing worth mentioning,\" replied Camilla. \"I don't wish to make a\ndisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in\nthe night than I am quite equal to.\"\n\"Then don't think of me,\" retorted Miss Havisham.\n\"Very easily said!\" remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a\nhitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. \"Raymond is a\nwitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.\nRaymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings\nand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with\nanxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,\nI should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I\nwish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night\u2014The\nidea!\" Here, a burst of tears.\nThe Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\nhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this\npoint, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, \"Camilla, my\ndear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually\nundermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than\nthe other.\"\n\"I am not aware,\" observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\nonce, \"that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\nperson, my dear.\"\nMiss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated\nold woman, with a small face that might have been made of\nwalnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers,\nsupported this position by saying, \"No, indeed, my dear. Hem!\"\n\"Thinking is easy enough,\" said the grave lady.\n\"What is easier, you know?\" assented Miss Sarah Pocket.\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\" cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\nrise from her legs to her bosom. \"It's all very true! It's a weakness\nto be so affectionate, but I can't help it. No doubt my health would be\nmuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition\nif I could. It's the cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to\nknow I possess it, when I wake up in the night.\" Here another burst of\nfeeling.\nMiss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\nround and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the",

I have often asked myself the question\nsince; but what else could I do?

I therefore hit\nout at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, \"Aha!

Therefore, I\nfollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking\nme if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he\nbegged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned\nwith a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. \"Available for\nboth,\" he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to\npulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a\nmanner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\nAlthough he did not look very healthy,\u2014having pimples on his face, and\na breaking out at his mouth,\u2014these dreadful preparations quite appalled\nme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\nthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for\nbattle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\nadvance of the rest of him as to development.\nMy heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\nminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\nas I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,\nlooking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\nfore-shortened.\nBut, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a\ngreat show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\nsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\nlooking up at me out of a black eye.\nHis spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\nstrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked\ndown; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or\ndrinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in\nseconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air\nand a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at\nlast. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I\nhit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again and\nagain, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head\nagainst the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and\nturned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;\nbut finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the\nsame time panting out, \"That means you have won.\"\nHe seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\ncontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\nso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, \"Can I help you?\"\nand he said \"No thankee,\" and I said \"Good afternoon,\" and _he_ said\n\"Same to you.\"\nWhen I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.\nBut she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her\nwaiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though\nsomething had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the\ngate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.\n\"Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.\"\nI kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone\nthrough a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was\ngiven to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and\nthat it was worth nothing.",

It had been placed\nthere since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular\noccupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired\nof walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and\nacross the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over\nagain, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as\nlong as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general\nmention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled\nthat I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes,\nand because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten\nmonths.\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more\nto me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I\ngoing to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I\nbelieved; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know\neverything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that\ndesirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer\nmy being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,\u2014or anything\nbut my daily dinner,\u2014nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my\nservices.\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told\nme I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;\nsometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite\nfamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she\nhated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we\nwere alone, \"Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said\nyes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when\nwe played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish\nof Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods\nwere so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled\nwhat to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish\nfondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like \"Break their\nhearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\"\nThere was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which\nthe burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of\nrendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in\nthat relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure\nof beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the\nintroduction of Old Clem's respected name. Thus, you were to hammer\nboys round\u2014Old Clem! With a thump and a sound\u2014Old Clem! Beat it out,\nbeat it out\u2014Old Clem! With a clink for the stout\u2014Old Clem! Blow the\nfire, blow the fire\u2014Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher\u2014Old Clem!\nOne day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly\nsaying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, \"There,\nthere, there! Sing!\" I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I\npushed her over the floor. It happened so to catch her fancy that she\ntook it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.\nAfter that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,\nand Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so\nsubdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in\nthe grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.",

That ass,\nPumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to\nthis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these\nhands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would\nhave done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of\nmind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before\nhim,\u2014as it were, to operate upon,\u2014and he would drag me up from my stool\n(usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me\nbefore the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,\n\"Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by\nhand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which\nso did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!\" And then he would\nrumple my hair the wrong way,\u2014which from my earliest remembrance, as\nalready hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any\nfellow-creature to do,\u2014and would hold me before him by the sleeve,\u2014a\nspectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.\nThen, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\nabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,\nthat I used to want\u2014quite painfully\u2014to burst into spiteful tears, fly\nat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\nevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.\nIn these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,\nwhile they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that he\nwas not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old\nenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into\nopposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out\nof his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating\nend to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to\nlead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching\nsight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, \"Come!\nthere's enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_'ve given trouble\nenough for one night, I hope!\" As if I had besought them as a favour to\nbother my life out.",

One word!\"\nThus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe\nin a distinct emphatic voice, \"The boy has been a good boy here, and\nthat is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no\nother and no more.\"\nHow Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I\nknow that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs\ninstead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went\nafter him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the\ngate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the\ndaylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,\n\"Astonishing!\" And there he remained so long saying, \"Astonishing\" at\nintervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming\nback. At length he prolonged his remark into \"Pip, I do assure _you_\nthis is as-TON-ishing!\" and so, by degrees, became conversational and\nable to walk away.\nI have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the\nencounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's\nhe invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what\ntook place in Mr. Pumblechook's parlour: where, on our presenting\nourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.\n\"Well?\" cried my sister, addressing us both at once. \"And what's\nhappened to _you_? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor\nsociety as this, I am sure I do!\"\n\"Miss Havisham,\" said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of\nremembrance, \"made it wery partick'ler that we should give her\u2014were it\ncompliments or respects, Pip?\"\n\"Compliments,\" I said.\n\"Which that were my own belief,\" answered Joe; \"her compliments to Mrs.\nJ. Gargery\u2014\"\n\"Much good they'll do me!\" observed my sister; but rather gratified\ntoo.\n\"And wishing,\" pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another\neffort of remembrance, \"that the state of Miss Havisham's elth were\nsitch as would have\u2014allowed, were it, Pip?\"\n\"Of her having the pleasure,\" I added.\n\"Of ladies' company,\" said Joe. And drew a long breath.\n\"Well!\" cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.\n\"She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but\nit's better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole\nhere?\"\n\"She giv' him,\" said Joe, \"nothing.\"\nMrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.\n\"What she giv',\" said Joe, \"she giv' to his friends. 'And by his\nfriends,' were her explanation, 'I mean into the hands of his sister\nMrs. J. Gargery.' Them were her words; 'Mrs. J. Gargery.' She mayn't\nhave know'd,\" added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, \"whether it\nwere Joe, or Jorge.\"\nMy sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden\narm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all\nabout it beforehand.\n\"And how much have you got?\" asked my sister, laughing. Positively\nlaughing!\n\"What would present company say to ten pound?\" demanded Joe.\n\"They'd say,\" returned my sister, curtly, \"pretty well. Not too much,\nbut pretty well.\"\n\"It's more than that, then,\" said Joe.\nThat fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he\nrubbed the arms of his chair, \"It's more than that, Mum.\"\n\"Why, you don't mean to say\u2014\" began my sister.\n\"Yes I do, Mum,\" said Pumblechook; \"but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good\nin you! Go on!\"\n\"What would present company say,\" proceeded Joe, \"to twenty pound?\"\n\"Handsome would be the word,\" returned my sister.\n\"Well, then,\" said Joe, \"It's more than twenty pound.\"\nThat abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a\npatronizing laugh, \"It's more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her\nup, Joseph!\"\n\"Then to make an end of it,\" said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to\nmy sister; \"it's five-and-twenty pound.\"\n\"It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum,\" echoed that basest of swindlers,\nPumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; \"and it's no more than\nyour merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy\nof the money!\"",

And there my\nsister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would\nserve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue\nBoar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring\nthe Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.\nIt was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, it\ninscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole\ncompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it\nworse, they all asked me from time to time,\u2014in short, whenever they had\nnothing else to do,\u2014why I didn't enjoy myself? And what could I\npossibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,\u2014when I wasn't!\nHowever, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the\nmost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent\ncontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;\nand, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I\nplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\nto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks.\nMy only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they\nwouldn't let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,\nwoke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the\nevening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins's ode, and threw his bloodstained\nsword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and\nsaid, \"The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it\nwasn't the Tumblers' Arms.\" That, they were all in excellent spirits on\nthe road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and\nasserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive\nbore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by\nwanting to know all about everybody's private affairs) that _he_ was\nthe man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole\nthe weakest pilgrim going.\nFinally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly\nwretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like\nJoe's trade.

      "text": "It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be\nblack ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive\nand well deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.\nHome had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister's\ntemper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had\nbelieved in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon; I had believed\nin the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose\nsolemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had\nbelieved in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; I\nhad believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and\nindependence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all\ncoarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella\nsee it on any account.\nHow much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,\nhow much Miss Havisham's, how much my sister's, is now of no moment to\nme or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well\nor ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.\nOnce, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my\nshirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe's 'prentice, I should be\ndistinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt\nthat I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight\nupon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have\nbeen occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I\nhave felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its\ninterest and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance\nany more. Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my\nway in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly\nentered road of apprenticeship to Joe.\nI remember that at a later period of my \"time,\" I used to stand about\nthe churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my\nown perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness\nbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both\nthere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite\nas dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that\nafter-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe\nwhile my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I _am_ glad to\nknow of myself in that connection.\nFor, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I\nproceed to add was Joe's. It was not because I was faithful, but\nbecause Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier\nor a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of\nindustry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,\nthat I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible\nto know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing\nman flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it\nhas touched one's self in going by, and I know right well that any good\nthat intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented\nJoe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.\nWhat I wanted, who can say? How can _I_ say, when I never knew? What I\ndreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and\ncommonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of\nthe wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she\nwould, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing\nthe coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.\nOften after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were\nsinging Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss\nHavisham's would seem to show me Estella's face in the fire, with her\npretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,\u2014often at\nsuch a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the\nwall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her\njust drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at\nlast.\nAfter that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal would\nhave a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of\nhome than ever, in my own ungracious breast.",

What is any visit made for?\"\n\"There is some wisits p'r'aps,\" said Joe, \"as for ever remains open to\nthe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might\nthink you wanted something,\u2014expected something of her.\"\n\"Don't you think I might say that I did not, Joe?\"\n\"You might, old chap,\" said Joe. \"And she might credit it. Similarly\nshe mightn't.\"\nJoe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.\n\"You see, Pip,\" Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, \"Miss\nHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the\nhandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were\nall.\"\n\"Yes, Joe. I heard her.\"\n\"ALL,\" Joe repeated, very emphatically.\n\"Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.\"\n\"Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,\u2014Make a end\non it!\u2014As you was!\u2014Me to the North, and you to the South!\u2014Keep in\nsunders!\"\nI had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to\nfind that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more\nprobable.\n\"But, Joe.\"\n\"Yes, old chap.\"\n\"Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day\nof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after\nher, or shown that I remember her.\"\n\"That's true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\nall four round,\u2014and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four\nround might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of\nhoofs\u2014\"\n\"I don't mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don't mean a present.\"\nBut Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon\nit. \"Or even,\" said he, \"if you was helped to knocking her up a new\nchain for the front door,\u2014or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws\nfor general use,\u2014or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork\nwhen she took her muffins,\u2014or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\nlike\u2014\"\n\"I don't mean any present at all, Joe,\" I interposed.\n\"Well,\" said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly\npressed it, \"if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn't. No, I would _not_. For\nwhat's a door-chain when she's got one always up? And shark-headers is\nopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you'd go\ninto brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can't\nshow himself oncommon in a gridiron,\u2014for a gridiron IS a gridiron,\"\nsaid Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring\nto rouse me from a fixed delusion, \"and you may haim at what you like,\nbut a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your\nleave, and you can't help yourself\u2014\"\n\"My dear Joe,\" I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, \"don't\ngo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any\npresent.\"\n\"No, Pip,\" Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all\nalong; \"and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.\"\n\"Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack\njust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I\nwould go uptown and make a call on Miss Est\u2014Havisham.\"\n\"Which her name,\" said Joe, gravely, \"ain't Estavisham, Pip, unless she\nhave been rechris'ened.\"\n\"I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,\nJoe?\"\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of\nit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received\nwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for\na favour received, then this experimental trip should have no\nsuccessor.

Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete\nsuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.\nWhat could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical\ninterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he\nmeant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether\nhe was man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation\nadmitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence\nstraightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt\naprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in\nthat neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.\nOrlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young\ngentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come\nout of it. Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had\ndropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I\nthink), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was\nrecommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her",

Mr. Wopsle had in\nhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that\nmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on\nthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner\ndid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence\nhad put a 'prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,\nand insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour. As I\nknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the\nway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better\nthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into\nPumblechook's just as the street and the shops were lighting up.\nAs I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I\ndon't know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it\ntook until half-past nine o' clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle\ngot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he\nbecame so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful\ncareer. I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being\ncut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to\nseed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was\na mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the\nidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When\nBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively\napologetic, Pumblechook's indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,\ntoo, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and\nmaudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating\ncircumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every\noccasion; it became sheer monomania in my master's daughter to care a\nbutton for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating\nconduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general\nfeebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle\nhad closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his\nhead, and saying, \"Take warning, boy, take warning!\" as if it were a\nwell-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided\nI could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.\nIt was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with\nMr. Wopsle on the walk home.

We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose\nwith a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we\ncame upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.\n\"Halloa!\" we said, stopping. \"Orlick there?\"\n\"Ah!\" he answered, slouching out. \"I was standing by a minute, on the\nchance of company.\"\n\"You are late,\" I remarked.\nOrlick not unnaturally answered, \"Well? And _you_'re late.\"\n\"We have been,\" said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,\u2014\"we\nhave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.\"\nOld Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all\nwent on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending\nhis half-holiday up and down town?\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn't see\nyou, but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns\nis going again.\"\n\"At the Hulks?\" said I.\n\"Ay! There's some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been\ngoing since dark, about. You'll hear one presently.\"\nIn effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the\nwell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily\nrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing\nand threatening the fugitives.\n\"A good night for cutting off in,\" said Orlick. \"We'd be puzzled how to\nbring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.\"\nThe subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in\nsilence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening's\ntragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,\nwith his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very\ndark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the\nsound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled\nsulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my\nthoughts. Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game\non Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick\nsometimes growled, \"Beat it out, beat it out,\u2014Old Clem! With a clink\nfor the stout,\u2014Old Clem!\" I thought he had been drinking, but he was\nnot drunk.\nThus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us\npast the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find\u2014it being\neleven o'clock\u2014in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and\nunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered\nabout. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising that\na convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.\n\"There's something wrong,\" said he, without stopping, \"up at your\nplace, Pip. Run all!\"\n\"What is it?\" I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.\n\"I can't quite understand. The house seems to have been violently\nentered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has\nbeen attacked and hurt.\"\nWe were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no\nstop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole\nvillage was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there\nwas Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst\nof the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,\nand so I became aware of my sister,\u2014lying without sense or movement on\nthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on\nthe back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was\nturned towards the fire,\u2014destined never to be on the Rampage again,\nwhile she was the wife of Joe.",

      "text": "With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to\nbelieve that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,\nor at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under\nobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\nany one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began\nto reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all\nsides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.\nJoe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a\nquarter after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten. While he was\nthere, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had\nexchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could not\nbe more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into\ndense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been\nbefore nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found\nher struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The\nfire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle\nvery long; the candle, however, had been blown out.\nNothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond\nthe blowing out of the candle,\u2014which stood on a table between the door\nand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and\nwas struck,\u2014was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such\nas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one\nremarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with\nsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were\ndealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\nviolence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when\nJoe picked her up, was a convict's leg-iron which had been filed\nasunder.\nNow, Joe, examining this iron with a smith's eye, declared it to have\nbeen filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the\nHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe's opinion was\ncorroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the\nprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they\nclaimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been\nworn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further,\none of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his\niron.\nKnowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed\nthe iron to be my convict's iron,\u2014the iron I had seen and heard him\nfiling at, on the marshes,\u2014but my mind did not accuse him of having put\nit to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have\nbecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.\nEither Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.\nNow, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we\npicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the\nevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and\nhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against\nhim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with\neverybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if\nhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no\ndispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore\nthem. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in\nso silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could\nlook round.\nIt was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however\nundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered\nunspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I\nshould at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the\nstory. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally\nin the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The\ncontention came, after all, to this;\u2014the secret was such an old one\nnow, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not\ntear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much\nmischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me\nif he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not\nbelieve it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets\nas a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of\ncourse\u2014for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing\nis always done?\u2014and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see\nany such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of\nthe assailant.",

They took up several obviously\nwrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,\nand persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead\nof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood\nabout the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks\nthat filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had a\nmysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as\ntaking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.\nLong after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay\nvery ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects\nmultiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of\nthe realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and\nher speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as\nto be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always\nby her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate\nin speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than\nindifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,\nextraordinary complications arose between them which I was always\ncalled in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine,\nthe substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among\nthe mildest of my own mistakes.\nHowever, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A\ntremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part\nof her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three\nmonths, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then\nremain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We\nwere at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a\ncircumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle's\ngreat-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had\nfallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.\nIt may have been about a month after my sister's reappearance in the\nkitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the\nwhole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.\nAbove all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly\ncut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had\nbeen accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me\nevery now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, \"Such a fine\nfigure of a woman as she once were, Pip!\" Biddy instantly taking the\ncleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe\nbecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,\nand to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that",

I had tried hard at it, but had made\nnothing of it. Thus it was:\u2014\nAgain and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a\ncharacter that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost\neagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly\nwanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,\nfrom tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the\nsign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my\nsister's ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\nqualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one\nafter another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the\nshape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and\ndisplayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook\nher head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified\nlest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.\nWhen my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this\nmysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at\nit, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked\nthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his\ninitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.\n\"Why, of course!\" cried Biddy, with an exultant face. \"Don't you see?\nIt's _him_!\"\nOrlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify\nhim by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the\nkitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his\narm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out,\nwith a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly\ndistinguished him.",

I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\nlaying it down.\n\"Biddy,\" said I, \"how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\nare very clever.\"\n\"What is it that I manage? I don't know,\" returned Biddy, smiling.\nShe managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\nmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\n\"How do you manage, Biddy,\" said I, \"to learn everything that I learn,\nand always to keep up with me?\" I was beginning to be rather vain of my\nknowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\ngreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have\nno doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\n\"I might as well ask you,\" said Biddy, \"how _you_ manage?\"\n\"No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\nme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.\"\n\"I suppose I must catch it like a cough,\" said Biddy, quietly; and went\non with her sewing.\nPursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\nBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her\nrather an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was\nequally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our\ndifferent sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I\nknew, Biddy knew.

Not that I have any\noccasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,\u2014as I\ntold you at home the other night.\"\n\"Ah!\" said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.\nAnd then repeated, with her former pleasant change, \"shall we walk a\nlittle farther, or go home?\"\nI said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the\nsummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very\nbeautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and\nwholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing\nbeggar my neighbour by candle-light in the room with the stopped\nclocks, and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good\nfor me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those\nremembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish\nwhat I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked\nmyself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were\nbeside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?\nI was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said\nto myself, \"Pip, what a fool you are!\"\nWe talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed\nright. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and\nsomebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no\npleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her\nown breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her",

There started up, from the gate,\nor from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant\nway), Old Orlick.\n\"Halloa!\" he growled, \"where are you two going?\"\n\"Where should we be going, but home?\"\n\"Well, then,\" said he, \"I'm jiggered if I don't see you home!\"\nThis penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of\nhis. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,\nbut used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,\nand convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger,\nI had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he\nwould have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\nBiddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\n\"Don't let him come; I don't like him.\" As I did not like him either, I\ntook the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn't want\nseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\nlaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\ndistance.\nCurious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give\nany account, I asked her why she did not like him.\n\"Oh!\" she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\n\"because I\u2014I am afraid he likes me.\"\n\"Did he ever tell you he liked you?\" I asked indignantly.\n\"No,\" said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, \"he never told me\nso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.\"\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon\nOld Orlick's daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on\nmyself.\n\"But it makes no difference to you, you know,\" said Biddy, calmly.\n\"No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don't like it; I don't\napprove of it.\"\n\"Nor I neither,\" said Biddy. \"Though _that_ makes no difference to\nyou.\"\n\"Exactly,\" said I; \"but I must tell you I should have no opinion of\nyou, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.\"\nI kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances\nwere favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that\ndemonstration. He had struck root in Joe's establishment, by reason of\nmy sister's sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\ndismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as\nI had reason to know thereafter.\nAnd now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated",

What is it?\"\n\"What is it?\" repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.\n\"Is it,\" pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious\nmanner, \"the printed paper you have just been reading from?\"\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\"Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal\nadvisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?\"\n\"I read that just now,\" Mr. Wopsle pleaded.\n\"Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don't ask you what you read\njust now. You may read the Lord's Prayer backwards, if you like,\u2014and,\nperhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper.

Come!\nDo you make that of it?\"\nMr. Wopsle answered, \"Those are not the exact words.\"\n\"Not the exact words!\" repeated the gentleman bitterly. \"Is that the\nexact substance?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Wopsle.\n\"Yes,\" repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company\nwith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. \"And now I\nask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that\npassage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having\npronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?\"\nWe all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought\nhim, and that he was beginning to be found out.\n\"And that same man, remember,\" pursued the gentleman, throwing his\nfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,\u2014\"that same man might be summoned as a\njuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed\nhimself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon\nhis pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly\ntry the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the\nprisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the\nevidence, so help him God!\"\nWe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too\nfar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet\ntime.\nThe strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and\nwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\nus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to",

You would want nothing for\nso doing?\"\n\"Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's\nway,\" said Joe, staring.\n\"Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,\" returned Mr.\nJaggers. \"The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\nanything?\"\n\"The answer is,\" returned Joe, sternly, \"No.\"\nI thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool\nfor his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between\nbreathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"Recollect the admission you have made,\nand don't try to go from it presently.\"\n\"Who's a-going to try?\" retorted Joe.\n\"I don't say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?\"\n\"Yes, I do keep a dog.\"\n\"Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\nBear that in mind, will you?\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\nand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\n\"Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got\nto make is, that he has great expectations.\"\nJoe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\n\"I am instructed to communicate to him,\" said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\nfinger at me sideways, \"that he will come into a handsome property.\nFurther, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\nproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of\nlife and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,\u2014in a word,\nas a young fellow of great expectations.\"",

This was the first time he\nhad taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he\nhad pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.\n\"Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?\"\n\"I _am_!\" said Joe, in a very decided manner.\n\"It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?\"\n\"It were understood,\" said Joe. \"And it are understood. And it ever\nwill be similar according.\"\n\"But what,\" said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,\u2014\"what if it was in my\ninstructions to make you a present, as compensation?\"\n\"As compensation what for?\" Joe demanded.\n\"For the loss of his services.\"\nJoe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have\noften thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or\npat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. \"Pip\nis that hearty welcome,\" said Joe, \"to go free with his services, to\nhonour and fortun', as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money\ncan make compensation to me for the loss of the little child\u2014what come\nto the forge\u2014and ever the best of friends!\u2014\"\nO dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I\nsee you again, with your muscular blacksmith's arm before your eyes,\nand your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good\nfaithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my\narm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel's\nwing!\nBut I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future\nfortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I\nbegged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best\nof friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes\nwith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but\nsaid not another word.\nMr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe the\nvillage idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said,\nweighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:\u2014\n\"Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half\nmeasures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in\ncharge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the\ncontrary you mean to say\u2014\" Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped\nby Joe's suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell\npugilistic purpose.\n\"Which I meantersay,\" cried Joe, \"that if you come into my place\nbull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if\nyou're a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay\nand stand or fall by!\"\nI drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to\nme, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\none whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a-going to be\nbull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when\nJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing any\ninclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory\nremarks. They were these.\n\"Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here\u2014as you are to be a\ngentleman\u2014the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall\nreceive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a\nhackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to\nme. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the\ntrust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now,\nunderstand that, finally. Understand that!\"\nHe was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\non, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\nSomething came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he",

Would there be any objection to my\ntaking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?\"\n\"No,\" said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\n\"I don't mean in the village only, but up town?\"\n\"No,\" said he. \"No objection.\"\nI thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had\nalready locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and was\nseated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at\nthe burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the\ncoals, and nothing was said for a long time.\nMy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at\nher needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next\nJoe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the\nglowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the\nlonger the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\nAt length I got out, \"Joe, have you told Biddy?\"\n\"No, Pip,\" returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\nknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to\nmake off somewhere, \"which I left it to yourself, Pip.\"\n\"I would rather you told, Joe.\"\n\"Pip's a gentleman of fortun' then,\" said Joe, \"and God bless him in\nit!\"\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\nat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\ncongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\ncongratulations that I rather resented.\nI took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with\nthe grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and\nsay nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in\ngood time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,\nsave that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.\nBiddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work\nagain, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining\nhis knees, said, \"Ay, ay, I'll be ekervally partickler, Pip;\" and then\nthey congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at\nthe notion of my being a gentleman that I didn't half like it.\nInfinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some\nidea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts\nentirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,\nand even repeated after Biddy, the words \"Pip\" and \"Property.\" But I\ndoubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I\ncannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.\nI never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy\nbecame more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.\nDissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is\npossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied\nwith myself.\nAnyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,\nlooking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and\nabout what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I\ncaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\noften looked at me,\u2014particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\nwere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\nby word or sign.\nAt those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\ndoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings\nto air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am\nafraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the\nrustic objects among which I had passed my life.\n\"Saturday night,\" said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\nand beer. \"Five more days, and then the day before _the_ day! They'll\nsoon go.\"\n\"Yes, Pip,\" observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\n\"They'll soon go.\"\n\"Soon, soon go,\" said Biddy.\n\"I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\norder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put\nthem on there, or that I'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook's. It\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.\"\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\ntoo, Pip,\" said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese\non it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. \"So might\nWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.\"\n\"That's just what I don't want, Joe. They would make such a business of\nit,\u2014such a coarse and common business,\u2014that I couldn't bear myself.\"\n\"Ah, that indeed, Pip!\" said Joe. \"If you couldn't abear yourself\u2014\"\nBiddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister's plate, \"Have you\nthought about when you'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister\nand me? You will show yourself to us; won't you?\"\n\"Biddy,\" I returned with some resentment, \"you are so exceedingly quick\nthat it's difficult to keep up with you.\"\n(\"She always were quick,\" observed Joe.)\n\"If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\nthat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,\u2014most likely\non the evening before I go away.\"\nBiddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\naffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I\ngot into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a\nmean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,\nfor ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even\nat the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\nbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\nso often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.\nThe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\nthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I\nsaw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or\ntwo in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and\nlight it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me\nthat he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.\nHe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his\npipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew\nthat they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing\ntone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for\nmore, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and\nsat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and\nstrange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the\nloneliest I had ever known.\nLooking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe's pipe\nfloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,\u2014not\nobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\ntogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\nbed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.",

He was still sweeping when I came out into\nthe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible\ncorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with\nany blacksmith, alive or dead.\n\"Hold that noise,\" said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, \"or\nI'll knock your head off!\u2014Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,\nthis,\" said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out\nin a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand\nunder it to show the gloss, \"is a very sweet article. I can recommend\nit for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you\nshall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!\" (To the boy, and with\na dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant's\nbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)\nMr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\ndeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.\nThen he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. \"And let\nme have none of your tricks here,\" said Mr. Trabb, \"or you shall repent\nit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.\"\nMr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential\nconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an\narticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it\nwould ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished\nfellow-townsman's (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having\nworn. \"Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,\" said Mr.\nTrabb to the boy after that, \"or shall I kick you out of the shop and\nbring them myself?\"\nI selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb's\njudgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.\nTrabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented\nwith it, he said apologetically that it \"wouldn't do under existing\ncircumstances, sir,\u2014wouldn't do at all.\" So, Mr. Trabb measured and\ncalculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest\nspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I\nfelt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\npains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\nto Mr. Pumblechook's on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand\nupon the parlour lock, \"I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be\nexpected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a\nturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem\nit. Good-morning, sir, much obliged.\u2014Door!\"\nThe last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what\nit meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\nhands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\nwas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb's boy.",

Joseph!!!\" Thereupon\nhe shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in\nJoseph.\n\"But my dear young friend,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"you must be hungry,\nyou must be exhausted.

I did the same; and if I had turned\nmyself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more\ndirect to my head.\nMr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of\ntongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and\ntook, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. \"Ah! poultry,\npoultry! You little thought,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising the\nfowl in the dish, \"when you was a young fledgling, what was in store\nfor you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this\nhumble roof for one as\u2014Call it a weakness, if you will,\" said Mr.\nPumblechook, getting up again, \"but may I? _may_ I\u2014?\"\nIt began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so he\ndid it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself\nwith my knife, I don't know.\n\"And your sister,\" he resumed, after a little steady eating, \"which had\nthe honour of bringing you up by hand! It's a sad picter, to reflect\nthat she's no longer equal to fully understanding the honour.

Ever\nforgiving and ever affable. It might,\" said the servile Pumblechook,\nputting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, \"to a\ncommon person, have the appearance of repeating\u2014but _may_ I\u2014?\"\nWhen he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. \"Let\nus never be blind,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"to her faults of temper, but\nit is to be hoped she meant well.\"\nAt about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in\nthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.\nI mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes\nsent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him.

      "text": "And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run\nout fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more\nsteadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled\naway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more\nappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I\ndressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my\nsplendour\t until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,\ngraced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish\nwith. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in\nspirits.\nI was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little\nhand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all\nalone. I am afraid\u2014sore afraid\u2014that this purpose originated in my sense\nof the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the\ncoach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of\nthis taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on\nthis last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had\nan impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in\nthe morning. I did not.\nAll night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places\ninstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now\npigs, now men,\u2014never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me\nuntil the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and\npartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in\ntaking it fell asleep.\nBiddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not\nsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\nI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the\nafternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking\nof the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go\ndownstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and\nunstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,\nuntil Biddy called to me that I was late.\nIt was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,\nsaying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,\n\"Well! I suppose I must be off!\" and then I kissed my sister who was\nlaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,\nand threw my arms around Joe's neck. Then I took up my little\nportmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I\npresently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing\nan old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped\nthen, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above\nhis head, crying huskily \"Hooroar!\" and Biddy put her apron to her\nface.\nI walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had\nsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to\nhave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High\nStreet. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very\npeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to\nshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all\nbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave\nand sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the\nvillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, \"Good-bye, O my dear,\ndear friend!\"\nHeaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain\nupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was\nbetter after I had cried than before,\u2014more sorry, more aware of my own\ningratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe\nwith me then.\nSo subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the\ncourse of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was\nclear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would\nnot get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another\nevening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made\nup my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite\npracticable to get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while\nI was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact\nresemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my\nheart would beat high.\u2014As if he could possibly be there!\nWe changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to\ngo back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and\nthe world lay spread before me.\nThis is the end of the first stage of Pip's expectations.",

His getting on\nhis box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old\nweather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a\nwork of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets\noutside, and ragged things behind for I don't know how many footmen to\nhold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from\nyielding to the temptation.\nI had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a\nstraw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the\nhorses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman\nbeginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop\nwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open\ndoor, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.\n\"How much?\" I asked the coachman.\nThe coachman answered, \"A shilling\u2014unless you wish to make it more.\"\nI naturally said I had no wish to make it more.\n\"Then it must be a shilling,\" observed the coachman. \"I don't want to\nget into trouble. _I_ know _him_!\" He darkly closed an eye at Mr.\nJaggers's name, and shook his head.\nWhen he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the\nascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his\nmind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my\nhand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?\n\"He is not,\" returned the clerk. \"He is in Court at present. Am I\naddressing Mr. Pip?\"\nI signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.\n\"Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn't say how\nlong he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time\nbeing valuable, that he won't be longer than he can help.\"\nWith those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner",

There were not so many papers\nabout, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd\nobjects about, that I should not have expected to see,\u2014such as an old\nrusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and\npackages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly\nswollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed\nchair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,\nlike a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and\nbit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the\nclients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the\nwall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with\nshoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled\nforth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being\nturned out.\nI sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's\nchair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I\ncalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\neverybody else's disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many\nother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have\nthe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what\nwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came\nthere. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's\nfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\nill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\nblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.\nOf course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits\nmay have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and\ngrit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in\nMr. Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts\non the shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.",

So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being\nall asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to\nme. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a\nstreet where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul's bulging at me\nfrom behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate\nPrison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered\nwith straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and\nfrom the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits\nand beer, I inferred that the trials were on.\nWhile I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk\nminister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a\ntrial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half\na crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice\nin his wig and robes,\u2014mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and\npresently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence.

This was horrible, and gave me a\nsickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice's\nproprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his\npocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not\nbelonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had\nbought cheap of the executioner.

I\nthink for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to\nfind you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't\nhear a word.\"\nThe two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind\nagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.\n\"And now _you_!\" said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on\nthe two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly\nseparated,\u2014\"Oh! Amelia, is it?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Jaggers.\"\n\"And do you remember,\" retorted Mr. Jaggers, \"that but for me you\nwouldn't be here and couldn't be here?\"\n\"O yes, sir!\" exclaimed both women together. \"Lord bless you, sir, well\nwe knows that!\"\n\"Then why,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"do you come here?\"\n\"My Bill, sir!\" the crying woman pleaded.\n\"Now, I tell you what!\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"Once for all.

No\none remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the\nskirts of Mr. Jaggers's coat to his lips several times.\n\"I don't know this man!\" said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating\nstrain: \"What does this fellow want?\"\n\"Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth.

This guileless confectioner was\nnot by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of\nrecovery, which was painted over.\n\"Tell him to take his witness away directly,\" said my guardian to the\nclerk, in extreme disgust, \"and ask him what he means by bringing such\na fellow as that.\"\nMy guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,\nstanding, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed\nto bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements\nhe had made for me. I was to go to \"Barnard's Inn,\" to young Mr.\nPocket's rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I\nwas to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go\nwith him to his father's house on a visit, that I might try how I liked\nit. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,\u2014it was a very liberal\none,\u2014and had handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards\nof certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,\nand such other things as I could in reason want. \"You will find your\ncredit good, Mr. Pip,\" said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt\nlike a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, \"but I shall by\nthis means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find\nyou outrunning the constable. Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but\nthat's no fault of mine.\"\nAfter I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked\nMr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth\nwhile, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me,\nif I pleased.\nI then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk\nwas rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I\naccompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.\nWe found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way\namong them by saying coolly yet decisively, \"I tell you it's no use; he\nwon't have a word to say to one of you;\" and we soon got clear of them,\nand went on side by side.",

      "text": "Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was\nlike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in\nstature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have\nbeen imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some\nmarks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been\nsofter and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.\nThe chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment\nover his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them\noff. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his\nlinen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for\nhe wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a\nlady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,\nthat several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were\nquite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering\neyes,\u2014small, keen, and black,\u2014and thin wide mottled lips. He had had\nthem, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.\n\"So you were never in London before?\" said Mr. Wemmick to me.\n\"No,\" said I.\n\"_I_ was new here once,\" said Mr. Wemmick. \"Rum to think of now!\"\n\"You are well acquainted with it now?\"\n\"Why, yes,\" said Mr. Wemmick. \"I know the moves of it.\"\n\"Is it a very wicked place?\" I asked, more for the sake of saying\nsomething than for information.\n\"You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\nplenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.\"\n\"If there is bad blood between you and them,\" said I, to soften it off\na little.\n\"O! I don't know about bad blood,\" returned Mr. Wemmick; \"there's not\nmuch bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by\nit.\"\n\"That makes it worse.\"\n\"You think so?\" returned Mr. Wemmick. \"Much about the same, I should\nsay.\"\nHe wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before\nhim: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the\nstreets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a\nmouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the\ntop of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical\nappearance, and that he was not smiling at all.\n\"Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?\" I asked Mr. Wemmick.\n\"Yes,\" said he, nodding in the direction. \"At Hammersmith, west of\nLondon.\"\n\"Is that far?\"\n\"Well! Say five miles.\"\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\"Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!\" said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me\nwith an approving air. \"Yes, I know him. _I_ know him!\"\nThere was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\nthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways\nat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,\nwhen he said here we were at Barnard's Inn. My depression was not\nalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\nto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\nwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a\ndisembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection\nof shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club\nfor Tom-cats.\nWe entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\nlike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\nit, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the\nmost dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever\nseen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those\nhouses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and\ncurtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable\nmakeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,\nas if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of\nBarnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the\npresent occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy\nmourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,\nand it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and\nhumiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry\nrot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and\ncellar,\u2014rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand\nbesides\u2014addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,\n\"Try Barnard's Mixture.\"\nSo imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great\nexpectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. \"Ah!\" said he,\nmistaking me; \"the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does\nme.\"\nHe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,\u2014which\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\nthemselves without the means of coming down,\u2014to a set of chambers on\nthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\na label on the letter-box, \"Return shortly.\"\n\"He hardly thought you'd come so soon,\" Mr. Wemmick explained. \"You\ndon't want me any more?\"\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\n\"As I keep the cash,\" Mr. Wemmick observed, \"we shall most likely meet\npretty often. Good day.\"\n\"Good day.\"\nI put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he\nthought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\nhimself,\u2014\n\"To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?\"\nI was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\nbut said yes.\n\"I have got so out of it!\" said Mr. Wemmick,\u2014\"except at last. Very\nglad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!\"\nWhen we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window\nand had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it\ncame down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not\nput my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view\nof the Inn through the window's encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully\nlooking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.",

Gradually there arose\nbefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\nmember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\nbreath.\n\"Mr. Pip?\" said he.\n\"Mr. Pocket?\" said I.\n\"Dear me!\" he exclaimed. \"I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\ncoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\ncome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,\u2014not\nthat that is any excuse,\u2014for I thought, coming from the country, you\nmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\nMarket to get it good.\"\nFor a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\nhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think\nthis was a dream.\n\"Dear me!\" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \"This door sticks so!\"\nAs he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\nthe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\nthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\nthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\nthat he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\ndoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start\nout of my head, and as if this must be a dream.\n\"Pray come in,\" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \"Allow me to lead the way. I\nam rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably\nwell till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably\nthrough to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk\nabout London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As\nto our table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied\nfrom our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your\nexpense, such being Mr. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's\nnot by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my\nfather hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take\nit, if he had. This is our sitting-room,\u2014just such chairs and tables\nand carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You\nmustn't give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,\nbecause they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little\nbedroom; rather musty, but Barnard's _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;\nthe furniture's hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the\npurpose; if you should want anything, I'll go and fetch it. The\nchambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan't\nfight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the\nfruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite\nashamed.\"\nAs I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,\nOne, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I\nknew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,\u2014\n\"Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!\"",

Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy\nto me. But she couldn't,\u2014at all events, she didn't.\"\nI thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.\n\"Bad taste,\" said Herbert, laughing, \"but a fact. Yes, she had sent for\nme on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I\nsuppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been\nwhat-you-may-called it to Estella.\"\n\"What's that?\" I asked, with sudden gravity.\nHe was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his\nattention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.\n\"Affianced,\" he explained, still busy with the fruit. \"Betrothed.\nEngaged. What's-his-named. Any word of that sort.\"\n\"How did you bear your disappointment?\" I asked.\n\"Pooh!\" said he, \"I didn't care much for it. _She's_ a Tartar.\"\n\"Miss Havisham?\"\n\"I don't say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl's hard and\nhaughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by\nMiss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.\"\n\"What relation is she to Miss Havisham?\"\n\"None,\" said he. \"Only adopted.\"\n\"Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?\"\n\"Lord, Mr. Pip!\" said he. \"Don't you know?\"\n\"No,\" said I.\n\"Dear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And\nnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come\nthere, that day?\"\nI told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst\nout laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn't ask\nhim if _he_ was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly\nestablished.\n\"Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?\" he went on.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"You know he is Miss Havisham's man of business and solicitor, and has\nher confidence when nobody else has?\"\nThis was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with\na constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers\nin Miss Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at\nany other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having\never seen me there.\n\"He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he\ncalled on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father\nfrom his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham's\ncousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he\nis a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.\"\nHerbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who\nmore strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural\nincapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something\nwonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the\nsame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I\ndon't know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first\noccasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what\nmeans.\nHe was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered\nlanguor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did\nnot seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face,\nbut it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.\nHis figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had\ntaken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be\nlight and young. Whether Mr. Trabb's local work would have sat more\ngracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious\nthat he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried\noff my new suit.\nAs he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a\nbad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,\nand laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.\nI further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a\ncountry place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would\ntake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever\nhe saw me at a loss or going wrong.\n\"With pleasure,\" said he, \"though I venture to prophesy that you'll\nwant very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I\nshould like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me\nthe favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?\"\nI thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my\nChristian name was Philip.\n\"I don't take to Philip,\" said he, smiling, \"for it sounds like a moral\nboy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,\nor so fat that he couldn't see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that\nhe locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a\nbird's-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in\nthe neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious,\nand you have been a blacksmith,\u2014would you mind it?\"\n\"I shouldn't mind anything that you propose,\" I answered, \"but I don't\nunderstand you.\"\n\"Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of\nmusic by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.\"\n\"I should like it very much.\"\n\"Then, my dear Handel,\" said he, turning round as the door opened,\n\"here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the\ntable, because the dinner is of your providing.\"\nThis I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a\nnice little dinner,\u2014seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,\u2014and it\nacquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent\ncircumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.\nThis again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the\nbanquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have\nsaid, the lap of luxury,\u2014being entirely furnished forth from the\ncoffee-house,\u2014the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a\ncomparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter\nthe wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell\nover them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the\nbookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into\nmy bed in the next room,\u2014where I found much of its parsley and butter\nin a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made\nthe feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my\npleasure was without alloy.\nWe had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his\npromise to tell me about Miss Havisham.\n\"True,\" he replied. \"I'll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the\ntopic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put\nthe knife in the mouth,\u2014for fear of accidents,\u2014and that while the fork\nis reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It\nis scarcely worth mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people\ndo. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This\nhas two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is\nthe object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening\noysters, on the part of the right elbow.\"\nHe offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we\nboth laughed and I scarcely blushed.\n\"Now,\" he pursued, \"concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must\nknow, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her\nfather denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in\nyour part of the world, and was a brewer. I don't know why it should be\na crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you\ncannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was\nand brew. You see it every day.\"\n\"Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?\" said I.\n\"Not on any account,\" returned Herbert; \"but a public-house may keep a\ngentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his\ndaughter.\"\n\"Miss Havisham was an only child?\" I hazarded.\n\"Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she\nhad a half-brother. Her father privately married again\u2014his cook, I\nrather think.\"\n\"I thought he was proud,\" said I.\n\"My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,\nbecause he was proud, and in course of time _she_ died. When she was\ndead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then\nthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are\nacquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,\nextravagant, undutiful,\u2014altogether bad. At last his father disinherited\nhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though\nnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.\u2014Take another glass of wine,\nand excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to\nbe so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it\nbottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.\"\nI had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I\nthanked him, and apologised. He said, \"Not at all,\" and resumed.\n\"Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after\nas a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what\nwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.\nThere were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\nbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a\ndeep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father's\nanger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,\u2014merely breaking off,\nmy dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a\ntumbler.\"\nWhy I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to\nsay. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a\nmuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\nwithin those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he\nsaid in the cheerfullest manner, \"Not at all, I am sure!\" and resumed.\n\"There appeared upon the scene\u2014say at the races, or the public balls,\nor anywhere else you like\u2014a certain man, who made love to Miss\nHavisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,\nbefore you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that\nhe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he\nwas not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a\ngentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a\nprinciple of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever\nwas, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no\nvarnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you\nput on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued\nMiss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe\nshe had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the\nsusceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she\npassionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized\nhim. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got\ngreat sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out\nof a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his\nfather) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband\nhe must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in\nMiss Havisham's counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love\nto be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with\nthe exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or\njealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she\nwas doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too\nunreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily\nordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has\nnever seen her since.\"\nI thought of her having said, \"Matthew will come and see me at last\nwhen I am laid dead upon that table;\" and I asked Herbert whether his\nfather was so inveterate against her?\n\"It's not that,\" said he, \"but she charged him, in the presence of her\nintended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon\nher for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would\nlook true\u2014even to him\u2014and even to her. To return to the man and make an\nend of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were\nbought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were\ninvited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter\u2014\"\n\"Which she received,\" I struck in, \"when she was dressing for her\nmarriage? At twenty minutes to nine?\"\n\"At the hour and minute,\" said Herbert, nodding, \"at which she\nafterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it\nmost heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I\ndon't know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she\nlaid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never\nsince looked upon the light of day.\"",

      "text": "\"Is that all the story?\" I asked, after considering it.\n\"All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it\nout for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss\nHavisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was\nabsolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one\nthing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced\nconfidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it\nwas a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.\"\n\"I wonder he didn't marry her and get all the property,\" said I.\n\"He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have\nbeen a part of her half-brother's scheme,\" said Herbert. \"Mind! I don't\nknow that.\"\n\"What became of the two men?\" I asked, after again considering the\nsubject.\n\"They fell into deeper shame and degradation\u2014if there can be deeper\u2014and\nruin.\"\n\"Are they alive now?\"\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but\nadopted. When adopted?\"\nHerbert shrugged his shoulders. \"There has always been an Estella,\nsince I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now,\nHandel,\" said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, \"there is\na perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss\nHavisham, you know.\"\n\"And all that I know,\" I retorted, \"you know.\"\n\"I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity\nbetween you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your\nadvancement in life,\u2014namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to\nwhom you owe it,\u2014you may be very sure that it will never be encroached\nupon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.\"\nIn truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject\ndone with, even though I should be under his father's roof for years\nand years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I\nfelt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as\nI understood the fact myself.\nIt had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for\nthe purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the\nlighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to\nbe the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the\ncourse of conversation, what he was? He replied, \"A capitalist,\u2014an\nInsurer of Ships.\" I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in\nsearch of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, \"In the\nCity.\"\nI had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in\nthe City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer\non his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible\nhead open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd\nimpression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.\n\"I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in\ninsuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut\ninto the Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of\nthese things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on\nmy own account. I think I shall trade,\" said he, leaning back in his\nchair, \"to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and\nprecious woods. It's an interesting trade.\"\n\"And the profits are large?\" said I.\n\"Tremendous!\" said he.\nI wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than\nmy own.\n[Illustration]\n\"I think I shall trade, also,\" said he, putting his thumbs in his\nwaist-coat pockets, \"to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.\nAlso to Ceylon, especially for elephants' tusks.\"\n\"You will want a good many ships,\" said I.\n\"A perfect fleet,\" said he.\nQuite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked\nhim where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?\n\"I haven't begun insuring yet,\" he replied. \"I am looking about me.\"\nSomehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard's Inn. I said\n(in a tone of conviction), \"Ah-h!\"\n\"Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.\"\n\"Is a counting-house profitable?\" I asked.\n\"To\u2014do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?\" he asked, in reply.\n\"Yes; to you.\"\n\"Why, n-no; not to me.\" He said this with the air of one carefully\nreckoning up and striking a balance. \"Not directly profitable. That is,\nit doesn't pay me anything, and I have to\u2014keep myself.\"\nThis certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as\nif I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative\ncapital from such a source of income.\n\"But the thing is,\" said Herbert Pocket, \"that you look about you.\n_That's_ the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and\nyou look about you.\"\nIt struck me as a singular implication that you couldn't be out of a\ncounting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred\nto his experience.\n\"Then the time comes,\" said Herbert, \"when you see your opening. And\nyou go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then\nthere you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing\nto do but employ it.\"\nThis was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;\nvery like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded\nto his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all\nblows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then.\nIt was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest\nnecessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have\nbeen sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.\nYet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so\nunassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being\npuffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,\nand we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the\nstreets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to\nchurch at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the\nParks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe\ndid.\nOn a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had\nleft Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them\npartook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That\nI could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on\nthe very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of\nimpossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the\nLondon streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the\ndusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I\nhad put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of\nnight, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning\nabout Barnard's Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my\nheart.\nOn the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the\ncounting-house to report himself,\u2014to look about him, too, I\nsuppose,\u2014and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or two\nto attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It\nappeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched\nwere incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging\nfrom the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday\nmorning. Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my\neyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard,\nof a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another\nback second floor, rather than a look out.\nI waited about until it was noon, and I went upon 'Change, and I saw\nfluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to\nbe great merchants, though I couldn't understand why they should all be\nout of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a\ncelebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have\nbeen the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help\nnoticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths\nand knives and waiters' clothes, than in the steaks. This collation\ndisposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease, which was not\ncharged for), we went back to Barnard's Inn and got my little\nportmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at\ntwo or three o'clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk\nto Mr. Pocket's house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct\ninto a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket's children\nwere playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my\ninterests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.\nand Mrs. Pocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but\nwere tumbling up.\nMrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\nher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids\nwere looking about them while the children played. \"Mamma,\" said\nHerbert, \"this is young Mr. Pip.\" Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity.\n\"Master Alick and Miss Jane,\" cried one of the nurses to two of the\nchildren, \"if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over\ninto the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?\"\nAt the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket's handkerchief, and\nsaid, \"If that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!\" Upon which\nMrs. Pocket laughed and said, \"Thank you, Flopson,\" and settling\nherself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance\nimmediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been\nreading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,\nshe fixed her eyes upon me, and said, \"I hope your mamma is quite\nwell?\" This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I\nbegan saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such\nperson I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have\nbeen very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the\nnurse came to my rescue.\n\"Well!\" she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, \"if that don't\nmake seven times! What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!\" Mrs.\nPocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\nrecognition, and said, \"Thank you, Flopson,\" and forgot me, and went on\nreading.\nI found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\nsix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the\nregion of air, wailing dolefully.\n\"If there ain't Baby!\" said Flopson, appearing to think it most\nsurprising. \"Make haste up, Millers.\"\nMillers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by\ndegrees the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a\nyoung ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all\nthe time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\nWe were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\nrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\nnear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\ntumbled over her,\u2014always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\ntheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\nthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\nspeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\nwhich baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\nPocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\nand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\n\"Gracious me, Flopson!\" said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\nmoment, \"everybody's tumbling!\"\n\"Gracious you, indeed, Mum!\" returned Flopson, very red in the face;\n\"what have you got there?\"\n\"_I_ got here, Flopson?\" asked Mrs. Pocket.\n\"Why, if it ain't your footstool!\" cried Flopson. \"And if you keep it\nunder your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here! Take the\nbaby, Mum, and give me your book.\"\nMrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\nlittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\nlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made\nthe second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the\nlittle Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\nUnder these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the\nchildren into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket\ncame out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to\nfind that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression\nof face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he\ndidn't quite see his way to putting anything straight.",

I believe he had been knighted himself for\nstorming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate\naddress engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first\nstone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage\neither the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed\nMrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature\nof things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the\nacquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.\nSo successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\nby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but\nperfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,\nin the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was\nalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to\nmount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing\nthe one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket\nhad taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it\nwould seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the\nknowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing\nto bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that\ndower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket\nthat his wife was \"a treasure for a Prince.\" Mr. Pocket had invested\nthe Prince's treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was\nsupposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.\nPocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,\nbecause she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of\na queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.",

Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap\n(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the\ninkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered\nhis master, and, considering that he wasn't brought up to evidence,\ndidn't plan it badly.\"\n\"Is it like him?\" I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat\nupon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.\n\"Like him? It's himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,\ndirectly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me,\nhadn't you, Old Artful?\" said Wemmick. He then explained this\naffectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady\nand the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,\n\"Had it made for me, express!\"\n\"Is the lady anybody?\" said I.\n\"No,\" returned Wemmick. \"Only his game. (You liked your bit of game,\ndidn't you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except\none,\u2014and she wasn't of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn't\nhave caught _her_ looking after this urn, unless there was something to\ndrink in it.\" Wemmick's attention being thus directed to his brooch, he\nput down the cast, and polished the brooch with his\npocket-handkerchief.\n\"Did that other creature come to the same end?\" I asked. \"He has the\nsame look.\"\n\"You're right,\" said Wemmick; \"it's the genuine look. Much as if one\nnostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, he\ncame to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He\nforged wills, this blade did, if he didn't also put the supposed\ntestators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though\" (Mr.\nWemmick was again apostrophising), \"and you said you could write Greek.\nYah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!\"\nBefore putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the\nlargest of his mourning rings and said, \"Sent out to buy it for me,\nonly the day before.\"\nWhile he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,\nthe thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived\nfrom like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood\nbefore me, dusting his hands.\n\"O yes,\" he returned, \"these are all gifts of that kind. One brings\nanother, you see; that's the way of it. I always take 'em. They're\ncuriosities. And they're property. They may not be worth much, but,\nafter all, they're property and portable.

He\nreplied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect\nme at the office at six o'clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,\nputting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.\n\"Did you think of walking down to Walworth?\" said he.\n\"Certainly,\" said I, \"if you approve.\"\n\"Very much,\" was Wemmick's reply, \"for I have had my legs under the\ndesk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I'll tell you\nwhat I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,\u2014which\nis of home preparation,\u2014and a cold roast fowl,\u2014which is from the\ncook's-shop. I think it's tender, because the master of the shop was a\nJuryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.\nI reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, \"Pick us out a\ngood one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box\nanother day or two, we could easily have done it.\" He said to that,\n\"Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.\" I let him, of\ncourse. As far as it goes, it's property and portable. You don't object\nto an aged parent, I hope?\"\nI really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,\n\"Because I have got an aged parent at my place.\" I then said what\npoliteness required.\n\"So, you haven't dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?\" he pursued, as we walked\nalong.\n\"Not yet.\"\n\"He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect\nyou'll have an invitation to-morrow. He's going to ask your pals, too.\nThree of 'em; ain't there?\"\nAlthough I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my\nintimate associates, I answered, \"Yes.\"\n\"Well, he's going to ask the whole gang,\"\u2014I hardly felt complimented by\nthe word,\u2014\"and whatever he gives you, he'll give you good. Don't look\nforward to variety, but you'll have excellence. And there's another rum\nthing in his house,\" proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if\nthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood; \"he never lets a\ndoor or window be fastened at night.\"\n\"Is he never robbed?\"\n\"That's it!\" returned Wemmick. \"He says, and gives it out publicly, \"I\nwant to see the man who'll rob _me_.\" Lord bless you, I have heard him,\na hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in\nour front office, \"You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn\nthere; why don't you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can't I\ntempt you?\" Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on,\nfor love or money.\"\n\"They dread him so much?\" said I.\n\"Dread him,\" said Wemmick. \"I believe you they dread him. Not but what\nhe's artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia\nmetal, every spoon.\"\n\"So they wouldn't have much,\" I observed, \"even if they\u2014\"\n\"Ah! But _he_ would have much,\" said Wemmick, cutting me short, \"and\nthey know it. He'd have their lives, and the lives of scores of 'em.\nHe'd have all he could get. And it's impossible to say what he couldn't\nget, if he gave his mind to it.\"\nI was falling into meditation on my guardian's greatness, when Wemmick\nremarked:\u2014\n\"As to the absence of plate, that's only his natural depth, you know. A\nriver's its natural depth, and he's his natural depth. Look at his\nwatch-chain. That's real enough.\"\n\"It's very massive,\" said I.\n\"Massive?\" repeated Wemmick. \"I think so. And his watch is a gold\nrepeater, and worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny. Mr. Pip,\nthere are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about\nthat watch; there's not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who\nwouldn't identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it\nwas red hot, if inveigled into touching it.\"\nAt first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a\nmore general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the\nroad, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the\ndistrict of Walworth.",

Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that's what he likes. Nod away at\nhim, if you please, like winking!\"\n\"This is a fine place of my son's, sir,\" cried the old man, while I\nnodded as hard as I possibly could. \"This is a pretty pleasure-ground,\nsir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept\ntogether by the Nation, after my son's time, for the people's\nenjoyment.\"\n\"You're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged?\" said Wemmick,\ncontemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened;\n\"_there's_ a nod for you;\" giving him a tremendous one; \"_there's_\nanother for you;\" giving him a still more tremendous one; \"you like\nthat, don't you? If you're not tired, Mr. Pip\u2014though I know it's tiring\nto strangers\u2014will you tip him one more? You can't think how it pleases\nhim.\"\nI tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him\nbestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in\nthe arbour; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had\ntaken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present\npitch of perfection.\n\"Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?\"\n\"O yes,\" said Wemmick, \"I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It's a\nfreehold, by George!\"\n\"Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?\"\n\"Never seen it,\" said Wemmick. \"Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.\nNever heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is\nanother. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and\nwhen I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it's not\nin any way disagreeable to you, you'll oblige me by doing the same. I\ndon't wish it professionally spoken about.\"\nOf course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his\nrequest. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and\ntalking, until it was almost nine o'clock. \"Getting near gun-fire,\"\nsaid Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; \"it's the Aged's treat.\"\nProceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,\nwith expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great\nnightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\nmoment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and\nrepair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the\nStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a\ncottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup\nin it ring. Upon this, the Aged\u2014who I believe would have been blown out\nof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows\u2014cried out exultingly,\n\"He's fired! I heerd him!\" and I nodded at the old gentleman until it\nis no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.\nThe interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me\nhis collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious\ncharacter; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been\ncommitted, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and\nseveral manuscript confessions written under condemnation,\u2014upon which\nMr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, \"every\none of 'em Lies, sir.\" These were agreeably dispersed among small\nspecimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the\nproprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.\nThey were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had\nbeen first inducted, and which served, not only as the general\nsitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan\non the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the\nsuspension of a roasting-jack.\nThere was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged\nin the day.

It had an\nunusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would\nwash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,\nwhenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his\nroom. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o'clock next day, he\nseemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than\nusual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only\nwashing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And\neven when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,\nhe took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before\nhe put his coat on.\nThere were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into\nthe street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was\nsomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his\npresence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along\nwestward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of\nthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he\nnever otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody\nrecognised him.\nHe conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side\nof that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in\nwant of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and\nopened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and\nlittle used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark\nbrown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the\npanelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know\nwhat kind of loops I thought they looked like.\nDinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\ndressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the\nwhole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was\ncomfortably laid\u2014no silver in the service, of course\u2014and at the side of\nhis chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and\ndecanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert.

The furniture was all very\nsolid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,\nand there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a\nlittle table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring\nthe office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\nevening and fall to work.\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,\u2014for he and I had\nwalked together,\u2014he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\n\"Pip,\" said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\nthe window, \"I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?\"\n\"The spider?\" said I.\n\"The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.\"\n\"That's Bentley Drummle,\" I replied; \"the one with the delicate face is\nStartop.\"\nNot making the least account of \"the one with the delicate face,\" he\nreturned, \"Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\nfellow.\"\nHe immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to\nscrew discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came\nbetween me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,\u2014but I may have thought her\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\npale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious\nexpression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see\nMacbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked\nto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had\nseen rise out of the Witches' caldron.\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\nat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\nplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\na dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own\nstriking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that\nwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and\na purpose of always holding her in suspense.",

For myself, I found that I was expressing\nmy tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to\nboast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my\nlips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\nIt was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible\nagency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity\nabout this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show\nhow muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in\na ridiculous manner.\nNow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap,\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\n\"If you talk of strength,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"_I_'ll show you a wrist.\nMolly, let them see your wrist.\"\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\nhand behind her waist. \"Master,\" she said, in a low voice, with her\neyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. \"Don't.\"\n\"_I_'ll show you a wrist,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\ndetermination to show it. \"Molly, let them see your wrist.\"\n\"Master,\" she again murmured. \"Please!\"\n\"Molly,\" said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\nat the opposite side of the room, \"let them see _both_ your wrists.\nShow them. Come!\"\nHe took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\nbrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\nside. The last wrist was much disfigured,\u2014deeply scarred and scarred\nacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\nMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\nin succession.\n\"There's power here,\" said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\nwith his forefinger. \"Very few men have the power of wrist that this\nwoman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\nhands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\nstronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.\"\nWhile he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\nhe ceased, she looked at him again. \"That'll do, Molly,\" said Mr.\nJaggers, giving her a slight nod; \"you have been admired, and can go.\"\nShe withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,\nputting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and\npassed round the wine.\n\"At half-past nine, gentlemen,\" said he, \"we must break up. Pray make\nthe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I",

Through all his stages, Mr.\nJaggers followed him with the same strange interest.

It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that\nit came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\npresence but a week or so before.\n\"Well,\" retorted Drummle; \"he'll be paid.\"\n\"I don't mean to imply that he won't,\" said I, \"but it might make you\nhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.\"\n\"_You_ should think!\" retorted Drummle. \"Oh Lord!\"\n\"I dare say,\" I went on, meaning to be very severe, \"that you wouldn't\nlend money to any of us if we wanted it.\"\n\"You are right,\" said Drummle. \"I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence.\nI wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.\"\n\"Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.\"\n\"_You_ should say,\" repeated Drummle. \"Oh Lord!\"\nThis was so very aggravating\u2014the more especially as I found myself\nmaking no way against his surly obtuseness\u2014that I said, disregarding\nHerbert's efforts to check me,\u2014\n\"Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what\npassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.\"\n\"_I_ don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,\"\ngrowled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.\n\"I'll tell you, however,\" said I, \"whether you want to know or not. We\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.\"\nDrummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\nit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\nHereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\nI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\nbeing a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\nopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\npersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\nus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,\nDrummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his\npockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and\nwould have flung it at his adversary's head, but for our entertainer's\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\npurpose.\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, \"I am exceedingly\nsorry to announce that it's half past nine.\"\nOn this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\nStartop was cheerily calling Drummle \"old boy,\" as if nothing had\nhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\neven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\nwho remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\nStartop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the\nhouses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.",

Our time of starting from the Cross Keys\nwas two o'clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to\nspare, attended by the Avenger,\u2014if I may connect that expression with\none who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.\nAt that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards\nby stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside\npassengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling\ntheir ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised\nwhen Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were\ntwo convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old\nreason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word\n\"convict.\"\n\"You don't mind them, Handel?\" said Herbert.\n\"O no!\"\n\"I thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?\"\n\"I can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don't\nparticularly. But I don't mind them.\"\n\"See! There they are,\" said Herbert, \"coming out of the Tap. What a\ndegraded and vile sight it is!\"\nThey had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler\nwith them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.\nThe two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their\nlegs,\u2014irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I\nlikewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a\nthick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good\nunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at\nthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts\nwere an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he\nthe Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and\nappeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the\nworld, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller\nsuit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those\nshapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his\nhalf-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on\nthe settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had\nbrought me down with his invisible gun!\nIt was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\nnever seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye\nappraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said\nsomething to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves\nround with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something\nelse. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;\ntheir coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower\nanimals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with\npocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them\nand kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable\nand degraded spectacle.",

It came out that the whole of the\nback of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and\nthat there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in\nfront behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had\ntaken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,\nand said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such\nvillainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and\ninfamous, and shameful, and I don't know what else. At this time the\ncoach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing\nto get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,\u2014bringing\nwith them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and\nhearthstone, which attends the convict presence.\n\"Don't take it so much amiss, sir,\" pleaded the keeper to the angry\npassenger; \"I'll sit next you myself. I'll put 'em on the outside of\nthe row. They won't interfere with you, sir. You needn't know they're\nthere.\"\n\"And don't blame _me_,\" growled the convict I had recognised. \"_I_\ndon't want to go. _I_ am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am\nconcerned any one's welcome to _my_ place.\"\n\"Or mine,\" said the other, gruffly. \"_I_ wouldn't have incommoded none\nof you, if I'd had _my_ way.\" Then they both laughed, and began\ncracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.\u2014As I really think I\nshould have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so\ndespised.\nAt length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,\nand that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So\nhe got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into\nthe place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as\nthey could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his\nbreath on the hair of my head.\n\"Good-bye, Handel!\" Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a\nblessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.\nIt is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's\nbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\nsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\nbreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\ndoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,\nin my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.\nThe weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold.

I dozed\noff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\nand how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\nwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\nquestion up again.\nBut I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I\ncould recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\nshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\nblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\nthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\nwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\nmy own thought, \"Two One Pound notes.\"\n\"How did he get 'em?\" said the convict I had never seen.\n\"How should I know?\" returned the other. \"He had 'em stowed away\nsomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.\"\n\"I wish,\" said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, \"that I\nhad 'em here.\"\n\"Two one pound notes, or friends?\"\n\"Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\nthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says\u2014?\"\n\"So he says,\" resumed the convict I had recognised,\u2014\"it was all said\nand done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\nDock-yard,\u2014'You're a-going to be discharged?' Yes, I was. Would I find\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\none pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.\"\n\"More fool you,\" growled the other. \"I'd have spent 'em on a Man, in\nwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\nnothing of you?\"\n\"Not a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried\nagain for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.\"\n\"And was that\u2014Honour!\u2014the only time you worked out, in this part of the\ncountry?\"\n\"The only time.\"\n\"What might have been your opinion of the place?\"\n\"A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\nmist, and mudbank.\"\nThey both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\ngrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.\nAfter overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and\nbeen left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling\ncertain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not\nonly so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and\nso differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could\nhave known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our\nbeing together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a\ndread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in\nhis hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as\nsoon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This\ndevice I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot\nunder my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down\nbefore me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the\nfirst stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their\nway with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off\nto the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting\nfor them at the slime-washed stairs,\u2014again heard the gruff \"Give way,\nyou!\" like and order to dogs,\u2014again saw the wicked Noah's Ark lying out\non the black water.\nI could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether\nundefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on\nto the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension\nof a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am\nconfident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the\nrevival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.",

She reserved it for\nme to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark\nrooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down\nthe cobwebs, destroy the vermin,\u2014in short, do all the shining deeds of\nthe young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess.

I mention this in this\nplace, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be\nfollowed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the\nconventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified\ntruth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her\nsimply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my\nsorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against\nreason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against\nhappiness, against all discouragement that could be.

When I\nhad rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the\ngate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart\nmoderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the\ncourtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its\nrusty hinges.\nBeing at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started\nmuch more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober\ngrey dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of\nporter at Miss Havisham's door.\n\"Orlick!\"\n\"Ah, young master, there's more changes than yours. But come in, come\nin. It's opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.\"\nI entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. \"Yes!\"\nsaid he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards\nthe house. \"Here I am!\"\n\"How did you come here?\"\n\"I come here,\" he retorted, \"on my legs. I had my box brought alongside\nme in a barrow.\"\n\"Are you here for good?\"\n\"I ain't here for harm, young master, I suppose?\"\nI was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my\nmind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my\nlegs and arms, to my face.\n\"Then you have left the forge?\" I said.\n\"Do this look like a forge?\" replied Orlick, sending his glance all\nround him with an air of injury. \"Now, do it look like it?\"\nI asked him how long he had left Gargery's forge?\n\"One day is so like another here,\" he replied, \"that I don't know\nwithout casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.\"\n\"I could have told you that, Orlick.\"\n\"Ah!\" said he, dryly. \"But then you've got to be a scholar.\"\nBy this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one\njust within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the\ncourtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of\nplace usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were\nhanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his\npatchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. The\nwhole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a\nhuman dormouse; while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a\ncorner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was\nfitted up,\u2014as indeed he was.",

Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been\nworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an\nelegant lady whom I had never seen.\n\"Come in, Pip,\" Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking\nround or up; \"come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as\nif I were a queen, eh?\u2014Well?\"\nShe looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a\ngrimly playful manner,\u2014\n\"Well?\"\n\"I heard, Miss Havisham,\" said I, rather at a loss, \"that you were so\nkind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.\"\n\"Well?\"\nThe lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked\narchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella's eyes. But she\nwas so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,\nin all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that\nI seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that I\nslipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O the\nsense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the\ninaccessibility that came about her!\nShe gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt\nin seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a\nlong, long time.\n\"Do you find her much changed, Pip?\" asked Miss Havisham, with her\ngreedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between\nthem, as a sign to me to sit down there.\n\"When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella\nin the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into\nthe old\u2014\"\n\"What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?\" Miss Havisham\ninterrupted. \"She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away\nfrom her. Don't you remember?\"\nI said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better\nthen, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she\nhad no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very\ndisagreeable.\n\"Is _he_ changed?\" Miss Havisham asked her.\n\"Very much,\" said Estella, looking at me.\n\"Less coarse and common?\" said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella's\nhair.\nEstella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,\nand looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,\nbut she lured me on.\nWe sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so\nwrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from\nFrance, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,\nshe had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that\nit was impossible and out of nature\u2014or I thought so\u2014to separate them\nfrom her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence\nfrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had\ndisturbed my boyhood,\u2014from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had\nfirst made me ashamed of home and Joe,\u2014from all those visions that had\nraised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the\nanvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden\nwindow of the forge, and flit away.

      "text": "So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I\nhad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;\nI, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,\nquite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As\nwe drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,\u2014\n\"I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\nthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.\"\n\"You rewarded me very much.\"\n\"Did I?\" she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. \"I remember I\nentertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.\"\n\"He and I are great friends now.\"\n\"Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nI made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\nlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\n\"Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\ncompanions,\" said Estella.\n\"Naturally,\" said I.\n\"And necessarily,\" she added, in a haughty tone; \"what was fit company\nfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.\"\nIn my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\nintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\nit to flight.\n\"You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?\" said\nEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\ntimes.\n\"Not the least.\"\nThe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\nside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\nhers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\nmore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\nso set apart for her and assigned to her.\nThe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\ninto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\nwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\ncareless look in that direction, \"Did I?\" I reminded her where she had\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, \"I\ndon't remember.\" \"Not remember that you made me cry?\" said I. \"No,\"\nsaid she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe\nthat her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry\nagain, inwardly,\u2014and that is the sharpest crying of all.\n\"You must know,\" said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\nbeautiful woman might, \"that I have no heart,\u2014if that has anything to\ndo with my memory.\"\nI got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\ndoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\nwithout it.\n\"Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,\" said\nEstella, \"and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But\nyou know what I mean. I have no softness there,\nno\u2014sympathy\u2014sentiment\u2014nonsense.\"\nWhat _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\nlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?\nNo. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of\nresemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been\nacquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much\nassociated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will\nproduce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces\nthat are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to\nMiss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,\nthe suggestion was gone.\nWhat _was_ it?\n\"I am serious,\" said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow\nwas smooth) as with a darkening of her face; \"if we are to be thrown\nmuch together, you had better believe it at once. No!\" imperiously\nstopping me as I opened my lips. \"I have not bestowed my tenderness\nanywhere. I have never had any such thing.\"\nIn another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\npointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\nfirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to\nhave seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand,\nagain the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed\nme. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.\nInstantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.\nWhat _was_ it?\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Estella. \"Are you scared again?\"\n\"I should be, if I believed what you said just now,\" I replied, to turn\nit off.\n\"Then you don't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\nsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\nlaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\nof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\ncruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.\"\nHer handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\nnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\nbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it\ncould not have been more cherished in my remembrance.\nThere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\nwe were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\nin her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\nbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my",

      "text": "At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\nthat my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\nwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while\nwe were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\nIt was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in\nthe funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\nchair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and\nbeautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\nThe time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\nand Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\nof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\nstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\ncloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\ndoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful.\nThen, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\nsaid in a whisper,\u2014\n\"Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?\"\n\"Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.\"\nShe drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\nshe sat in the chair. \"Love her, love her, love her! How does she use\nyou?\"\nBefore I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\nat all) she repeated, \"Love her, love her, love her! If she favours\nyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\npieces,\u2014and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,\u2014love\nher, love her, love her!\"\nNever had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\nutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm\nround my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\n\"Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\nto be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\nLove her!\"\nShe said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\nmeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead\nof love\u2014despair\u2014revenge\u2014dire death\u2014it could not have sounded from her\nlips more like a curse.\n\"I'll tell you,\" said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,\n\"what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning\nself-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself\nand against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the\nsmiter\u2014as I did!\"\nWhen she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\nher round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\ndress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck\nherself against the wall and fallen dead.\nAll this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\nwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\nthe room.\nHe always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\npocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\nof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as\nif he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or\nwitness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\ndirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he\nhad this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking\nat us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent\npause in that attitude, \"Indeed? Singular!\" and then put the\nhandkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.\nMiss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)\nafraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever.\n\"As punctual as ever,\" he repeated, coming up to us. \"(How do you do,\nPip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you\nare here, Pip?\"\nI told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\ncome and see Estella. To which he replied, \"Ah! Very fine young lady!\"\nThen he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\nlarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\nwere full of secrets.\n\"Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?\" said he, when\nhe came to a stop.\n\"How often?\"\n\"Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?\"\n\"Oh! Certainly not so many.\"\n\"Twice?\"\n\"Jaggers,\" interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, \"leave my Pip\nalone, and go with him to your dinner.\"\nHe complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\nyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\nand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\ntimes and once.\nI considered, and said, \"Never.\"\n\"And never will, Pip,\" he retorted, with a frowning smile. \"She has\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\npresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\nhands on such food as she takes.\"\n\"Pray, sir,\" said I, \"may I ask you a question?\"\n\"You may,\" said he, \"and I may decline to answer it. Put your\nquestion.\"\n\"Estella's name. Is it Havisham or\u2014?\" I had nothing to add.\n\"Or what?\" said he.\n\"Is it Havisham?\"\n\"It is Havisham.\"\nThis brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\nus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green\nand yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\nmaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\nwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\ntime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\nguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\ntwo ladies left us.\nAnything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\nroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\nhimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella's face once during\ndinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\nbut never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\nlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\nface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a\ndry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,\nhe showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\nextorted\u2014and even did extort, though I don't know how\u2014those references\nout of my innocent self.\nAnd when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that\nreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had\nnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted\nthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass\nagain, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and\ncross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had\nknown the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or\nfour times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he\nsaw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his\nhand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to\ntake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn't answer.\nI think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in\nthe danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her\ncap,\u2014which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,\u2014and\nstrewing the ground with her hair,\u2014which assuredly had never grown on\n_her_ head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss\nHavisham's room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss\nHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels\nfrom her dressing-table into Estella's hair, and about her bosom and\narms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\neyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.\n[Illustration]\nOf the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the\nglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor,\nof the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in\nthe light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out\nlong ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his\ncold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I\ncould never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never\nbear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear\nto see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be\nwithin a foot or two of him,\u2014it was, that my feelings should be in the\nsame place with him,\u2014_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.",

      "text": "On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country\nelevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The\nwhole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble\nboy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer\nwith a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in\nlife, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of\nwhite silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My\ngifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could\nhave wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.\nSeveral curious little circumstances transpired as the action\nproceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been\ntroubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it\nwith him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom\nalso carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had\nthe appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of\nanxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were\nsuggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led\nto the Shade's being advised by the gallery to \"turn over!\"\u2014a\nrecommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted\nof this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of\nhaving been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it\nperceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its\nterrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom\nlady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public\nto have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem\nby a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her\nwaist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so\nthat she was openly mentioned as \"the kettle-drum.\" The noble boy in\nthe ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were\nin one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a\nclergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court\nfencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice\ndiscrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a\nwant of toleration for him, and even\u2014on his being detected in holy\norders, and declining to perform the funeral service\u2014to the general\nindignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such\nslow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off\nher white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who\nhad been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the\nfront row of the gallery, growled, \"Now the baby's put to bed let's\nhave supper!\" Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.",

But I said he had looked very nice.\n\"When he come to the grave,\" said our conductor, \"he showed his cloak\nbeautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he see\nthe ghost in the queen's apartment, he might have made more of his\nstockings.\"\nI modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,\ninto a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it.

I hope, Mr. Pip,\nyou will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in\nformer times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been\nacknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to\nget himself out of his princely sables.\n\"Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,\" said the owner of that\nproperty, \"or you'll bust 'em. Bust 'em, and you'll bust\nfive-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a\nfiner pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave 'em to me.\"\nWith that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who,\non the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over\nbackward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.\nI had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then,\nMr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,\u2014\n\"Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?\"\nHerbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), \"Capitally.\" So\nI said \"Capitally.\"\n\"How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?\" said Mr.\nWaldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.\nHerbert said from behind (again poking me), \"Massive and concrete.\" So\nI said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon\nit, \"Massive and concrete.\"\n\"I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Waldengarver,\nwith an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall\nat the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.\n\"But I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,\" said the man who was\non his knees, \"in which you're out in your reading. Now mind! I don't\ncare who says contrairy; I tell you so. You're out in your reading of\nHamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed,\nmade the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to\nput a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal\n(which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and\nwhenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out \"I don't\nsee no wafers!\" And at night his reading was lovely.\"\nMr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say \"a faithful\nDependent\u2014I overlook his folly;\" and then said aloud, \"My view is a\nlittle classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,\nthey will improve.\"\nHerbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.\n\"Did you observe, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Waldengarver, \"that there was a\nman in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service,\u2014I\nmean, the representation?\"\nWe basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I\nadded, \"He was drunk, no doubt.\"\n\"O dear no, sir,\" said Mr. Wopsle, \"not drunk. His employer would see\nto that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.\"\n\"You know his employer?\" said I.\nMr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both\nceremonies very slowly. \"You must have observed, gentlemen,\" said he,\n\"an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance\nexpressive of low malignity, who went through\u2014I will not say\nsustained\u2014the r\u00f4le (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King\nof Denmark.

He's always so\nhigh. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.\nThat Colonel durst no more take leave of _him_, than that turnkey durst\nask him his intentions respecting a case.

      "text": "In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately\nbeautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was\nmore winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I\nthought I saw Miss Havisham's influence in the change.\nWe stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and\nwhen it was all collected I remembered\u2014having forgotten everything but\nherself in the meanwhile\u2014that I knew nothing of her destination.\n\"I am going to Richmond,\" she told me. \"Our lesson is, that there are\ntwo Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the\nSurrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage,\nand you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges\nout of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I,\nbut to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own\ndevices, you and I.\"\nAs she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner\nmeaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with\ndispleasure.\n\"A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a\nlittle?\"\n\"Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you\nare to take care of me the while.\"\nShe drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a\nwaiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen\nsuch a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,\nhe pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he\ncouldn't find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the\nestablishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous\narticle, considering the hole's proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,\nand somebody's pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us\ninto another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a\nscorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked\nat this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;\nwhich, proving to be merely, \"Some tea for the lady,\" sent him out of\nthe room in a very low state of mind.\nI was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong\ncombination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that\nthe coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising\nproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.\nYet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that\nwith her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all\nhappy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)\n\"Where are you going to, at Richmond?\" I asked Estella.\n\"I am going to live,\" said she, \"at a great expense, with a lady there,\nwho has the power\u2014or says she has\u2014of taking me about, and introducing\nme, and showing people to me and showing me to people.\"\n\"I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?\"\n\"Yes, I suppose so.\"\nShe answered so carelessly, that I said, \"You speak of yourself as if\nyou were some one else.\"\n\"Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,\" said Estella,\nsmiling delightfully, \"you must not expect me to go to school to _you_;\nI must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?\"\n\"I live quite pleasantly there; at least\u2014\" It appeared to me that I was\nlosing a chance.\n\"At least?\" repeated Estella.\n\"As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.\"\n\"You silly boy,\" said Estella, quite composedly, \"how can you talk such\nnonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest\nof his family?\"\n\"Very superior indeed. He is nobody's enemy\u2014\"\n\"Don't add but his own,\" interposed Estella, \"for I hate that class of\nman. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and\nspite, I have heard?\"\n\"I am sure I have every reason to say so.\"\n\"You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,\" said\nEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\ngrave and rallying, \"for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and\ninsinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,\nwrite letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment\nand the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourself\nthe hatred those people feel for you.\"\n\"They do me no harm, I hope?\"\nInstead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very\nsingular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When\nshe left off\u2014and she had not laughed languidly, but with real\nenjoyment\u2014I said, in my diffident way with her,\u2014\n\"I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\nharm.\"\n\"No, no you may be sure of that,\" said Estella. \"You may be certain\nthat I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and\nthe tortures they undergo!\" She laughed again, and even now when she\nhad told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not\ndoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I\nthought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw\nthe thought in my mind, and answered it.\n\"It is not easy for even you.\" said Estella, \"to know what satisfaction\nit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of\nthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not\nbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not\nyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed\nand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\nis soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round\nchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\nwoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\nin the night. I did.\"\nIt was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these\nremembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of\nthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.\n\"Two things I can tell you,\" said Estella. \"First, notwithstanding the\nproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your\nmind at rest that these people never will\u2014never would in a hundred\nyears\u2014impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great\nor small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\nbusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.\"\nAs she gave it to me playfully,\u2014for her darker mood had been but\nmomentary\u2014I held it and put it to my lips. \"You ridiculous boy,\" said\nEstella, \"will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the\nsame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?\"\n\"What spirit was that?\" said I.\n\"I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and\nplotters.\"\n\"If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?\"\n\"You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you\nlike.\"\nI leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue's. \"Now,\" said\nEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, \"you are to take\ncare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.\"\nHer reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,\nand we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our\nintercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,\nI could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on\nagainst trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it\nalways was.\nI rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,\nbrought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of\ntea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and\nforks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek\nlittle muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron\ncover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a\nquantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof\nimpressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of\nbread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in\nwith, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a\nprolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came\nback with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I\nsteeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances\nextracted one cup of I don't know what for Estella.\nThe bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,\nand the chambermaid taken into consideration,\u2014in a word, the whole\nhouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella's\npurse much lightened,\u2014we got into our post-coach and drove away.",

As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,\n\"Wretches!\" I would not have confessed to my visit for any\nconsideration.\n\"Mr. Jaggers,\" said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,\n\"has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\nthan any man in London.\"\n\"He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,\" said Estella, in a\nlow voice.\n\"You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?\"\n\"I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I\ncan remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could\nspeak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with\nhim?\"\n\"Once habituated to his distrustful manner,\" said I, \"I have done very\nwell.\"\n\"Are you intimate?\"\n\"I have dined with him at his private house.\"\n\"I fancy,\" said Estella, shrinking \"that must be a curious place.\"\n\"It is a curious place.\"\nI should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\nher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\nthe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden\nglare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive\nwith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out\nof it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in\nlightning.\nSo we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by\nwhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this\nside of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she\ntold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham's neighbourhood until she\nhad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in\ngoing and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\nwhile she remained here? To that she emphatically said \"God forbid!\"\nand no more.\nIt was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;\nthat she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task\nhad needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she\nhad not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should\nhave felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose\nto do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to\ncrush it and throw it away.\nWhen we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew\nPocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I\nhoped I should see her sometimes.\n\"O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you\nare to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.\"\nI inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?\n\"No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of\nsome station, though not averse to increasing her income.\"\n\"I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.\"\n\"It is a part of Miss Havisham's plans for me, Pip,\" said Estella, with\na sigh, as if she were tired; \"I am to write to her constantly and see\nher regularly and report how I go on,\u2014I and the jewels,\u2014for they are\nnearly all mine now.\"\nIt was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she\ndid so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.\nWe came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house\nby the green,\u2014a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,\nembroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their\ncourt days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still\ncut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and\nstiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of\nthe dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go\nthe silent way of the rest.\nA bell with an old voice\u2014which I dare say in its time had often said to\nthe house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted\nsword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire\u2014sounded\ngravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering\nout to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she\ngave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbed\nlikewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I\nshould be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy\nwith her, but always miserable.",

I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he\nconsorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an\nalmanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I\never saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we\nundertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a\nRepublic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except\nat a certain hour of every afternoon to \"go to Lloyd's\"\u2014in observance\nof a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything\nelse in connection with Lloyd's that I could find out, except come back\nagain. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively\nmust find an opening, he would go on 'Change at a busy time, and walk\nin and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the\nassembled magnates. \"For,\" says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on\none of those special occasions, \"I find the truth to be, Handel, that\nan opening won't come to one, but one must go to it,\u2014so I have been.\"\nIf we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated\none another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond\nexpression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight\nof the Avenger's livery; which had a more expensive and a less\nremunerative appearance then than at any other time in the\nfour-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast\nbecame a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at\nbreakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, \"not\nunwholly unconnected,\" as my local paper might put it, \"with jewelery,\"\nI went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him\noff his feet,\u2014so that he was actually in the air, like a booted\nCupid,\u2014for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.\nAt certain times\u2014meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our\nhumour\u2014I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,\u2014\n\"My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.\"\n\"My dear Handel,\" Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, \"if you\nwill believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange\ncoincidence.\"\n\"Then, Herbert,\" I would respond, \"let us look into our affairs.\"\nWe always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for\nthis purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to\nconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\nI know Herbert thought so too.\nWe ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\nsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds\nmight be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the\nmark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of\nink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was\nsomething very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\nI would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in\na neat hand, the heading, \"Memorandum of Pip's debts\"; with Barnard's\nInn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet\nof paper, and write across it with similar formalities, \"Memorandum of\nHerbert's debts.\"\nEach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\nwhich had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\nburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\notherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us\nexceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to\ndistinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually\npaying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things\nseemed about equal.",

Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not\nmy administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into\na focus for him.\nMy business habits had one other bright feature, which I called\n\"leaving a Margin.\" For example; supposing Herbert's debts to be one\nhundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, \"Leave a\nmargin, and put them down at two hundred.\" Or, supposing my own to be\nfour times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven\nhundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,\nbut I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have\nbeen an expensive device.

      "text": "It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and\nthe gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my\nsister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That\nthe place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed\nunable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my\nthoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming\ntowards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the\ndoor. In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated,\nthere was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of\nthe sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she\nwere still alive and had been often there.\nWhatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my\nsister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret\nwhich may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and\nperhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized\nwith a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had\nsuffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have\nrevengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.\nHaving written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him that\nI would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the\ncurious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the\nmorning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the\nforge.\nIt was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times\nwhen I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,\nvividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that\nsoftened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the\nbeans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it\nwould be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should\nbe softened as they thought of me.\nAt last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.\nhad put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally\nabsurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a\nblack bandage,\u2014as if that instrument could possibly communicate any\ncomfort to anybody,\u2014were posted at the front door; and in one of them I\nrecognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young\ncouple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of\nintoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped\nround the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and\nmost of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed\nwindows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two\nwarders (the postboy) knocked at the door,\u2014implying that I was far too\nmuch exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.\nAnother sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a\nwager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour. Here, Mr.\nTrabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves\nup, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity\nof black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished\nputting somebody's hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;\nso he held out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and\nconfused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of\nwarm affection.\nPoor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow\nunder his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,\nas chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent\ndown and said to him, \"Dear Joe, how are you?\" he said, \"Pip, old chap,\nyou knowed her when she were a fine figure of a\u2014\" and clasped my hand\nand said no more.\nBiddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly\nhere and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I\nthought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and\nthere began to wonder in what part of the house it\u2014she\u2014my sister\u2014was.\nThe air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I\nlooked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible\nuntil one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum\ncake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and\nbiscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had\nnever seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.\nStanding at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook\nin a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately\nstuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my\nattention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing\nsherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, \"May I, dear sir?\" and\ndid. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent\nspeechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to \"follow,\" and\nwere all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into\nridiculous bundles.\n\"Which I meantersay, Pip,\" Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.\nTrabb called \"formed\" in the parlour, two and two,\u2014and it was\ndreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; \"which I\nmeantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the\nchurch myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it\nwith willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbours\nwould look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in\nrespect.\"\n\"Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!\" cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a\ndepressed business-like voice. \"Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are\nready!\"\nSo we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses\nwere bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and\nPumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had\nbeen brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of\nUndertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded\nunder a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole\nlooked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and\nblundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,\u2014the postboy and\nhis comrade.\nThe neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and\nwe were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful\nand vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us\noff, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such\ntimes the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on\nour emergence round some corner of expectancy, \"_Here_ they come!\"\n\"_Here_ they are!\" and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was\nmuch annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted\nall the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband,\nand smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the\nexcessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited\nand vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.\nAnd now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the\nships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,\nclose to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this\nparish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was\nlaid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the\nlight wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.\nOf the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,\nI desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even\nwhen those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it\nbrought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it\nfleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him\ncough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came\nunexpectedly into large property. When we got back, he had the\nhardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had\ndone her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered it\nreasonably purchased at the price of her death. After that, he drank\nall the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two\ntalked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as\nif they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were\nnotoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.\nHubble,\u2014to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly\nBargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest",

Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a\ncold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the old\nkitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his\nknife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great\nrestraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and\nwhen I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down\ntogether on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I\nnoticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to\nmake a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which\nthe dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.\nHe was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little\nroom, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great\nthing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing\nin, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a\nlittle talk.\n\"Biddy,\" said I, \"I think you might have written to me about these sad\nmatters.\"\n\"Do you, Mr. Pip?\" said Biddy. \"I should have written if I had thought\nthat.\"\n\"Don't suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider\nthat you ought to have thought that.\"\n\"Do you, Mr. Pip?\"\nShe was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with\nher, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After\nlooking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave\nup that point.\n\"I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy\ndear?\"\n\"Oh! I can't do so, Mr. Pip,\" said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still\nof quiet conviction. \"I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am\ngoing to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of\nMr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.\"\n\"How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo\u2014\"\n\"How am I going to live?\" repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary\nflush upon her face. \"I'll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get\nthe place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be\nwell recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be industrious\nand patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,\"\npursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, \"the\nnew schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you\nafter that time, and have had time since then to improve.\"\n\"I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.\"\n\"Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature,\" murmured Biddy.\nIt was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!\nI thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further\nwith Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.\n\"I have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy.\"\n\"They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad\nstates\u2014though they had got better of late, rather than worse\u2014for four\ndays, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and\nsaid quite plainly, 'Joe.' As she had never said any word for a long\nwhile, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs\nto me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to\nput her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid\nher head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she\npresently said 'Joe' again, and once 'Pardon,' and once 'Pip.' And so\nshe never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later\nwhen we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.\"\nBiddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that\nwere coming out, were blurred in my own sight.\n\"Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"Do you know what is become of Orlick?\"\n\"I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in\nthe quarries.\"\n\"Of course you have seen him then?\u2014Why are you looking at that dark\ntree in the lane?\"\n\"I saw him there, on the night she died.\"\n\"That was not the last time either, Biddy?\"\n\"No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.\u2014It is of\nno use,\" said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running\nout, \"you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and\nhe is gone.\"\nIt revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by\nthis fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told\nher that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of\nthat country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she\ntold me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,\u2014she\ndidn't say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,\u2014but ever did\nhis duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a\ngentle heart.\n\"Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,\" said I; \"and Biddy,\nwe must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often\ndown here now.

Used!\"\nWell! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another\nsilent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.\n\"Biddy,\" said I, \"I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,\nto see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the\ngoodness, Biddy, to tell me why.\"\n\"Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?\" asked\nBiddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the\nstars with a clear and honest eye.\n\"O dear me!\" said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in\ndespair. \"This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don't say any\nmore, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.\"\nFor which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and\nwhen I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of\nher as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the\nchurchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the\nnight, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an\nunkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.\nEarly in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and\nlooking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I\nstood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of\nhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright\nsun of the life in store for him were shining on it.\n\"Good-bye, dear Joe!\u2014No, don't wipe it off\u2014for God's sake, give me your\nblackened hand!\u2014I shall be down soon and often.\"\n[Illustration]\n\"Never too soon, sir,\" said Joe, \"and never too often, Pip!\"\nBiddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk\nand a crust of bread. \"Biddy,\" said I, when I gave her my hand at\nparting, \"I am not angry, but I am hurt.\"\n\"No, don't be hurt,\" she pleaded quite pathetically; \"let only me be\nhurt, if I have been ungenerous.\"\nOnce more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to\nme, as I suspect they did, that I should _not_ come back, and that\nBiddy was quite right, all I can say is,\u2014they were quite right too.",

      "text": "Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our\ndebts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like\nexemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a\nway of doing; and I came of age,\u2014in fulfilment of Herbert's prediction,\nthat I should do so before I knew where I was.\nHerbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had\nnothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a\nprofound sensation in Barnard's Inn. But we had looked forward to my\none-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and\nanticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly\nhelp saying something definite on that occasion.\nI had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my\nbirthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from\nWemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call\nupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced\nus that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual\nflutter when I repaired to my guardian's office, a model of\npunctuality.\nIn the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and\nincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of\ntissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting\nit, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian's room. It was\nNovember, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back\nagainst the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.\n\"Well, Pip,\" said he, \"I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,\nMr. Pip.\"\nWe shook hands,\u2014he was always a remarkably short shaker,\u2014and I thanked\nhim.\n\"Take a chair, Mr. Pip,\" said my guardian.\nAs I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\nboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time\nwhen I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the\nshelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were\nmaking a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\n\"Now my young friend,\" my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\nbox, \"I am going to have a word or two with you.\"\n\"If you please, sir.\"\n\"What do you suppose,\" said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\nground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,\u2014\"what\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate of?\"\n\"At the rate of, sir?\"\n\"At,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\n\"the\u2014rate\u2014of?\" And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\npocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\nI had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\nany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\nI confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\nseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, \"I thought so!\" and blew his\nnose with an air of satisfaction.\n\"Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Have you anything to ask _me_?\"\n\"Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\nquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.\"\n\"Ask one,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?\"\n\"No. Ask another.\"\n\"Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?\"\n\"Waive that, a moment,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"and ask another.\"\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\nthe inquiry, \"Have-I\u2014anything to receive, sir?\" On that, Mr. Jaggers\nsaid, triumphantly, \"I thought we should come to it!\" and called to\nWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it\nin, and disappeared.\n\"Now, Mr. Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"attend, if you please. You have been\ndrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's\ncash-book; but you are in debt, of course?\"\n\"I am afraid I must say yes, sir.\"\n\"You know you must say yes; don't you?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"I don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did\nknow, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,\"\ncried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of\nprotesting: \"it's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but you\nwould. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\npiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\nand tell me what it is.\"\n\"This is a bank-note,\" said I, \"for five hundred pounds.\"\n\"That is a bank-note,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, \"for five hundred pounds.\nAnd a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?\"\n\"How could I do otherwise!\"\n\"Ah! But answer the question,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\"You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\nhandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\nday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\nsum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until\nthe donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your\nmoney affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from\nWemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are\nin communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\nagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\ninstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\nI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.\"\nI was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\nliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. \"I am\nnot paid, Pip,\" said he, coolly, \"to carry your words to any one;\" and\nthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\nhim.\nAfter a pause, I hinted,\u2014\n\"There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to\nwaive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it\nagain?\"\n\"What is it?\" said he.\nI might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me\naback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.\n\"Is it likely,\" I said, after hesitating, \"that my patron, the\nfountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon\u2014\" there I\ndelicately stopped.\n\"Will soon what?\" asked Mr. Jaggers. \"That's no question as it stands,\nyou know.\"\n\"Will soon come to London,\" said I, after casting about for a precise\nform of words, \"or summon me anywhere else?\"\n\"Now, here,\" replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his\ndark deep-set eyes, \"we must revert to the evening when we first\nencountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then,\nPip?\"\n\"You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that\nperson appeared.\"\n\"Just so,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"that's my answer.\"\nAs we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my\nstrong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came\nquicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I\nhad less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.\n\"Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?\"\nMr. Jaggers shook his head,\u2014not in negativing the question, but in\naltogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer\nit,\u2014and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my\neyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their\nsuspended attention, and were going to sneeze.\n\"Come!\" said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs\nof his warmed hands, \"I'll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That's a\nquestion I must not be asked. You'll understand that better, when I\ntell you it's a question that might compromise _me_. Come! I'll go a\nlittle further with you; I'll say something more.\"\nHe bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the\ncalves of his legs in the pause he made.\n\"When that person discloses,\" said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,\n\"you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person\ndiscloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that\nperson discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything\nabout it. And that's all I have got to say.\"\nWe looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked\nthoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion\nthat Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him\ninto her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he\nresented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did\nobject to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I\nraised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me\nall the time, and was doing so still.\n\"If that is all you have to say, sir,\" I remarked, \"there can be\nnothing left for me to say.\"\nHe nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me\nwhere I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.\nAs a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with his\ncompany, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on\nwalking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation\nfor him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had\nhis hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk\nto Wemmick.\nThe fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my\npocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there\nbefore; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise\nwith concerning such thought.\nHe had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going\nhome. He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office\ncandlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near\nthe door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his\nhat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest\nwith his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.\n\"Mr. Wemmick,\" said I, \"I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\nto serve a friend.\"\nWemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\n\"This friend,\" I pursued, \"is trying to get on in commercial life, but\nhas no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\nbeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.\"\n\"With money down?\" said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\n\"With _some_ money down,\" I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot\nacross me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home\u2014\"with _some_\nmoney down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" said Wemmick, \"I should like just to run over with you on my\nfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as\nChelsea Reach. Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two;\nBlackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.\"\nHe had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\nsafe-key on the palm of his hand. \"There's as many as six, you see, to\nchoose from.\"\n\"I don't understand you,\" said I.\n\"Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,\" returned Wemmick, \"and take a walk upon\nyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\nof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\nyou may know the end of it too,\u2014but it's a less pleasant and profitable\nend.\"\nI could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\nsaying this.\n\"This is very discouraging,\" said I.\n\"Meant to be so,\" said Wemmick.\n\"Then is it your opinion,\" I inquired, with some little indignation,\n\"that a man should never\u2014\"\n\"\u2014Invest portable property in a friend?\" said Wemmick. \"Certainly he\nshould not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,\u2014and then it\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get\nrid of him.\"\n\"And that,\" said I, \"is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?\"\n\"That,\" he returned, \"is my deliberate opinion in this office.\"\n\"Ah!\" said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\nhere; \"but would that be your opinion at Walworth?\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" he replied, with gravity, \"Walworth is one place, and this\noffice is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is\nanother. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments\nmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken\nin this office.\"\n\"Very well,\" said I, much relieved, \"then I shall look you up at\nWalworth, you may depend upon it.\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" he returned, \"you will be welcome there, in a private and\npersonal capacity.\"\nWe had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my\nguardian's ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in\nhis doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and\nstood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street\ntogether, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr.\nJaggers and I turned ours.\nI could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers\nhad had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a\nSomebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable\nconsideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all\nseemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he\nmade of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than\nWemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to\ndinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy,\nbecause, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes\nfixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and\nforgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.",

      "text": "Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick's Walworth\nsentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage\nto the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union\nJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of\ndefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most\npacific manner by the Aged.\n\"My son, sir,\" said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, \"rather\nhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word\nthat he would soon be home from his afternoon's walk. He is very\nregular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my\nson.\"\nI nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside.\n\"You made acquaintance with my son, sir,\" said the old man, in his\nchirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, \"at his office, I\nexpect?\" I nodded. \"Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand\nat his business, sir?\" I nodded hard. \"Yes; so they tell me. His\nbusiness is the Law?\" I nodded harder. \"Which makes it more surprising\nin my son,\" said the old man, \"for he was not brought up to the Law,\nbut to the Wine-Coopering.\"\nCurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\nreputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\nsprightly manner, \"No, to be sure; you're right.\" And to this hour I\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\nhad made.\nAs I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\nsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his\nown calling in life had been \"the Wine-Coopering.\" By dint of straining\nthat term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on\nthe chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my\nmeaning understood.\n\"No,\" said the old gentleman; \"the warehousing, the warehousing. First,\nover yonder;\" he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\nintended to refer me to Liverpool; \"and then in the City of London\nhere. However, having an infirmity\u2014for I am hard of hearing, sir\u2014\"\nI expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\n\"\u2014Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\nwent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and\nlittle made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to\nwhat you said, you know,\" pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,\n\"what I say is, No to be sure; you're right.\"\nI was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\nimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\non one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\nwooden flap with \"JOHN\" upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\nwith great triumph, \"My son's come home!\" and we both went out to the\ndrawbridge.\nIt was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the\nother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with\nthe greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,\nthat I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had\ncome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he\nwas accompanied.\nMiss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in\nthe post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or\nthree years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed\nof portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both\nbefore and behind, made her figure very like a boy's kite; and I might\nhave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves\na little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of\nfellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in\ndiscovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our\ngoing in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for\nannouncing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a\nmoment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently\nanother click came, and another little door tumbled open with \"Miss\nSkiffins\" on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then\nMiss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up\ntogether. On Wemmick's return from working these mechanical appliances,\nI expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he\nsaid, \"Well, you know, they're both pleasant and useful to the Aged.\nAnd by George, sir, it's a thing worth mentioning, that of all the\npeople who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known\nto the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!\"\n\"And Mr. Wemmick made them,\" added Miss Skiffins, \"with his own hands\nout of his own head.\"\nWhile Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green\ngloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was\ncompany), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the\nproperty, and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he\ndid this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I\nseized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\nHaving thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\nhad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\nbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\nwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert's home, and at his character, and\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\nthose, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\nconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\nhave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\nin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the\npossibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the\ncertainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any\nmean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told\nWemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a\ngreat affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some\nrays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience\nand knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my\nresources to help Herbert to some present income,\u2014say of a hundred a\nyear, to keep him in good hope and heart,\u2014and gradually to buy him on\nto some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to\nunderstand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert's\nknowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world\nwith whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his\nshoulder, and saying, \"I can't help confiding in you, though I know it\nmust be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever\nbrought me here.\"\nWemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of\nstart, \"Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is\ndevilish good of you.\"\n\"Say you'll help me to be good then,\" said I.\n\"Ecod,\" replied Wemmick, shaking his head, \"that's not my trade.\"\n\"Nor is this your trading-place,\" said I.\n\"You are right,\" he returned. \"You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,\nI'll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be\ndone by degrees. Skiffins (that's her brother) is an accountant and\nagent. I'll look him up and go to work for you.\"\n\"I thank you ten thousand times.\"\n\"On the contrary,\" said he, \"I thank you, for though we are strictly in\nour private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there\n_are_ Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.\"\nAfter a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned\ninto the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The\nresponsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and\nthat excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me\nin some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were\ngoing to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a\nhay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as\nit simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss\nSkiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises\nbecame strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to\nparticipate in the entertainment.\nThe flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right\nmoment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth\nas if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed\nthe tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of\nJohn and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some\nspasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I\ngot used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss\nSkiffins's arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and\nI rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the\nprofile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very\nnew moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by\nWemmick.\nWe ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was\ndelightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged\nespecially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage\ntribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins\u2014in the\nabsence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of\nher family on Sunday afternoons\u2014washed up the tea-things, in a trifling\nlady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on\nher gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, \"Now,\nAged Parent, tip us the paper.\"\nWemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that\nthis was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman\ninfinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. \"I won't offer an\napology,\" said Wemmick, \"for he isn't capable of many pleasures\u2014are\nyou, Aged P.?\"\n\"All right, John, all right,\" returned the old man, seeing himself\nspoken to.\n\"Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,\"\nsaid Wemmick, \"and he'll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,\nAged One.\"\n\"All right, John, all right!\" returned the cheerful old man, so busy\nand so pleased, that it really was quite charming.\nThe Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle's\ngreat-aunt's, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\nthrough a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\nthem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\nquite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all\nexpressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\nresumed again.\nAs Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a\nshadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.\nWemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually\nstealing his arm round Miss Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw\nhis hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment\nMiss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm\nagain as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest\ndeliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins's composure\nwhile she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever\nseen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction\nof mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it\nmechanically.\nBy and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and\ngradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\nwiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\nenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\nof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\nof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\nit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading,\nWemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled\nto it by Miss Skiffins.\nAt last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time\nfor Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black\nbottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical\ndignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these\nappliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who\nwas soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and\nWemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer\nto see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had\nbest go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and\nhaving passed a pleasant evening.\nBefore a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,\nstating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter\nappertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would\nbe glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to\nWalworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by\nappointment in the City several times, but never held any communication\nwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that\nwe found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long\nestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted\ncapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a\npartner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which\nHerbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds\ndown, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at\ncertain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my\nproperty. Miss Skiffins's brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick\npervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.\nThe whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the\nleast suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the\nradiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a\nmighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the\nyoung merchant's name), and of Clarriker's having shown an\nextraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the\nopening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his\nface brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate\nfriend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of\ntriumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and\nhe having that day entered Clarriker's House, and he having talked to\nme for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really\ncry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations\nhad done some good to somebody.\nA great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my",

There were other times when she would come to a sudden check\nin this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.\n\"Pip, Pip,\" she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat\napart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; \"will you never\ntake warning?\"\n\"Of what?\"\n\"Of me.\"\n\"Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?\"\n\"Do I mean! If you don't know what I mean, you are blind.\"\nI should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the\nreason that I always was restrained\u2014and this was not the least of my\nmiseries\u2014by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,\nwhen she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My\ndread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy\ndisadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious\nstruggle in her bosom.\n\"At any rate,\" said I, \"I have no warning given me just now, for you\nwrote to me to come to you, this time.\"\n\"That's true,\" said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always\nchilled me.\nAfter looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on\nto say:\u2014\n\"The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day\nat Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She\nwould rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,\nfor she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can\nyou take me?\"\n\"Can I take you, Estella!\"\n\"You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay\nall charges out of my purse. You hear the condition of your going?\"\n\"And must obey,\" said I.\nThis was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others\nlike it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as\nseen her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we\nfound her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless\nto add that there was no change in Satis House.\nShe was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I\nlast saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was\nsomething positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.\nShe hung upon Estella's beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her\ngestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked\nat her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had\nreared.\nFrom Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to\npry into my heart and probe its wounds. \"How does she use you, Pip; how\ndoes she use you?\" she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,\neven in Estella's hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire at\nnight, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella's hand drawn\nthrough her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by\ndint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular\nletters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;\nand as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind\nmortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch\nstick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a\nvery spectre.\nI saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of\ndependence and even of degradation that it awakened,\u2014I saw in this that\nEstella was set to wreak Miss Havisham's revenge on men, and that she\nwas not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw\nin this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her\nout to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with\nthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,\nand that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in\nthis that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even\nwhile the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my\nbeing staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's\ndeclining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.\nIn a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there\nbefore my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in\nthis, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which\nher life was hidden from the sun.",

It was the first time I had ever\nseen them opposed.\nWe were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham\nstill had Estella's arm drawn through her own, and still clutched\nEstella's hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.\nShe had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather\nendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.\n\"What!\" said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, \"are you tired\nof me?\"\n\"Only a little tired of myself,\" replied Estella, disengaging her arm,\nand moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at\nthe fire.\n\"Speak the truth, you ingrate!\" cried Miss Havisham, passionately\nstriking her stick upon the floor; \"you are tired of me.\"\nEstella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down at\nthe fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a\nself-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was\nalmost cruel.\n\"You stock and stone!\" exclaimed Miss Havisham. \"You cold, cold heart!\"\n\"What?\" said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she\nleaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; \"do\nyou reproach me for being cold? You?\"\n\"Are you not?\" was the fierce retort.\n\"You should know,\" said Estella. \"I am what you have made me. Take all\nthe praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the\nfailure; in short, take me.\"\n\"O, look at her, look at her!\" cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; \"Look at\nher so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I\ntook her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its\nstabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!\"\n[Illustration]\n\"At least I was no party to the compact,\" said Estella, \"for if I could\nwalk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But\nwhat would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe\neverything to you. What would you have?\"\n\"Love,\" replied the other.\n\"You have it.\"\n\"I have not,\" said Miss Havisham.\n\"Mother by adoption,\" retorted Estella, never departing from the easy\ngrace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never\nyielding either to anger or tenderness,\u2014\"mother by adoption, I have\nsaid that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All\nthat you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that,\nI have nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me,\nmy gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.\"\n\"Did I never give her love!\" cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.\n\"Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all\ntimes, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call\nme mad, let her call me mad!\"\n\"Why should I call you mad,\" returned Estella, \"I, of all people? Does\nany one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I\ndo? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as\nwell as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool\nthat is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up\ninto your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!\"\n\"Soon forgotten!\" moaned Miss Havisham. \"Times soon forgotten!\"\n\"No, not forgotten,\" retorted Estella,\u2014\"not forgotten, but treasured up\nin my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have\nyou found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving\nadmission here,\" she touched her bosom with her hand, \"to anything that\nyou excluded? Be just to me.\"\n\"So proud, so proud!\" moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her grey hair\nwith both her hands.\n\"Who taught me to be proud?\" returned Estella. \"Who praised me when I\nlearnt my lesson?\"\n\"So hard, so hard!\" moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.\n\"Who taught me to be hard?\" returned Estella. \"Who praised me when I\nlearnt my lesson?\"\n\"But to be proud and hard to _me_!\" Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as\nshe stretched out her arms. \"Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and\nhard to _me_!\"\nEstella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was\nnot otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at\nthe fire again.\n\"I cannot think,\" said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence \"why\nyou should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a\nseparation. I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have\nnever been unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any\nweakness that I can charge myself with.\"\n\"Would it be weakness to return my love?\" exclaimed Miss Havisham. \"But\nyes, yes, she would call it so!\"\n\"I begin to think,\" said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment\nof calm wonder, \"that I almost understand how this comes about. If you\nhad brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of\nthese rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as\nthe daylight by which she had never once seen your face,\u2014if you had\ndone that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the\ndaylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and\nangry?\"\nMiss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning,\nand swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.\n\"Or,\" said Estella,\u2014\"which is a nearer case,\u2014if you had taught her,\nfrom the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,\nthat there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her\nenemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had\nblighted you and would else blight her;\u2014if you had done this, and then,\nfor a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she\ncould not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?\"\nMiss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her\nface), but still made no answer.\n\"So,\" said Estella, \"I must be taken as I have been made. The success\nis not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.\"\nMiss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor,\namong the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took\nadvantage of the moment\u2014I had sought one from the first\u2014to leave the\nroom, after beseeching Estella's attention to her, with a movement of\nmy hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great\nchimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham's grey\nhair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and\nwas a miserable sight to see.\nIt was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an",

I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me\nwhile the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost\nbetween us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when\nhe called upon the company to pledge him to \"Estella!\"\n\"Estella who?\" said I.\n\"Never you mind,\" retorted Drummle.\n\"Estella of where?\" said I. \"You are bound to say of where.\" Which he\nwas, as a Finch.\n\"Of Richmond, gentlemen,\" said Drummle, putting me out of the question,\n\"and a peerless beauty.\"\nMuch he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I\nwhispered Herbert.\n\"I know that lady,\" said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had\nbeen honoured.\n\"_Do_ you?\" said Drummle.\n\"And so do I,\" I added, with a scarlet face.\n\"_Do_ you?\" said Drummle. \"_O_, Lord!\"\nThis was the only retort\u2014except glass or crockery\u2014that the heavy\ncreature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it\nas if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place\nand said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable\nFinch's impudence to come down to that Grove,\u2014we always talked about\ncoming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of\nexpression,\u2014down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew\nnothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by\nthat? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew\nwhere I was to be found.\nWhether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,\nafter this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The\ndebate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more\nhonourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they\nbelieved _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it was\ndecided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle\nwould bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that\nhe had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,\nas a gentleman and a Finch, for \"having been betrayed into a warmth\nwhich.\" Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honour\nshould take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a\npolite little avowal in Estella's hand, that she had had the honour of\ndancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret\nthat I had been \"betrayed into a warmth which,\" and on the whole to\nrepudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.\nDrummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the\nGrove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the\npromotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing\nrate.\nI tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot\nadequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should\nshow any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far\nbelow the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been\nreferable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my\nlove for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to\nthat hound.

A deficient,\nill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.\"\n\"Well?\" said she.\n\"You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\nroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?\"\n\"Well?\" said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her\nlovely eyes the wider.\nTo overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\nfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, \"Well! Then, that is\nwhy it makes me wretched.\"\nNow, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea\nof making me\u2014me\u2014wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;\nbut in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the\nquestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.\n\"Pip,\" said Estella, casting her glance over the room, \"don't be\nfoolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and\nmay be meant to have. It's not worth discussing.\"\n\"Yes it is,\" said I, \"because I cannot bear that people should say,\n'she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest\nin the crowd.'\"\n\"I can bear it,\" said Estella.\n\"Oh! don't be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.\"\n\"Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!\" said Estella, opening\nher hands. \"And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\nboor!\"\n\"There is no doubt you do,\" said I, something hurriedly, \"for I have\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never\ngive to\u2014me.\"\n\"Do you want me then,\" said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and\nserious, if not angry, look, \"to deceive and entrap you?\"\n\"Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?\"\n\"Yes, and many others,\u2014all of them but you.

It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its\ncircle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere\ninstant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was\nstrange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched\nand pleased by the sight of me.\nMoving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially\ndressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-grey\nhair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong\non his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to\nweather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp\nincluded us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was\nholding out both his hands to me.\n\"Pray what is your business?\" I asked him.\n\"My business?\" he repeated, pausing. \"Ah! Yes. I will explain my\nbusiness, by your leave.\"\n\"Do you wish to come in?\"\n\"Yes,\" he replied; \"I wish to come in, master.\"\nI had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the\nsort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.\nI resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to\nrespond to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and,\nhaving set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to\nexplain himself.\nHe looked about him with the strangest air,\u2014an air of wondering\npleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,\u2014and he\npulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head\nwas furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-grey hair grew only on\nits sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the\ncontrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands\nto me.\n\"What do you mean?\" said I, half suspecting him to be mad.\nHe stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over\nhis head. \"It's disapinting to a man,\" he said, in a coarse broken\nvoice, \"arter having looked for'ard so distant, and come so fur; but\nyou're not to blame for that,\u2014neither on us is to blame for that. I'll\nspeak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.\"\nHe sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his\nforehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him\nattentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know\nhim.\n\"There's no one nigh,\" said he, looking over his shoulder; \"is there?\"\n\"Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,\nask that question?\" said I.\n\"You're a game one,\" he returned, shaking his head at me with a\ndeliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most\nexasperating; \"I'm glad you've grow'd up, a game one! But don't catch\nhold of me. You'd be sorry arterwards to have done it.\"\nI relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet\nI could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and\nthe rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the\nintervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first\nstood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my\nconvict more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair\nbefore the fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to\nme; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round\nhis head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take a\nshivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition. I\nknew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before,\nI had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity.\nHe came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands. Not\nknowing what to do,\u2014for, in my astonishment I had lost my\nself-possession,\u2014I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them\nheartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.",

From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money\nleft me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got\nmy liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I\nwent for you. 'Lord strike a blight upon it,' I says, wotever it was I\nwent for, 'if it ain't for him!' It all prospered wonderful. As I giv'\nyou to understand just now, I'm famous for it. It was the money left\nme, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr.\nJaggers\u2014all for you\u2014when he first come arter you, agreeable to my\nletter.\"\nO that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,\u2014far from\ncontented, yet, by comparison happy!\n\"And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look'ee here, to know\nin secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them\ncolonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I\nsay? I says to myself, 'I'm making a better gentleman nor ever _you_'ll\nbe!' When one of 'em says to another, 'He was a convict, a few year\nago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he's lucky,' what do\nI say? I says to myself, 'If I ain't a gentleman, nor yet ain't got no\nlearning, I'm the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which\non you owns a brought-up London gentleman?' This way I kep myself\na-going. And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for\ncertain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on\nhis own ground.\"",

Dear\nboy, I done it!\"\nI tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had\nseemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;\neven now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though\nthose were loud and his was silent.\n\"Where will you put me?\" he asked, presently. \"I must be put\nsomewheres, dear boy.\"\n\"To sleep?\" said I.\n\"Yes. And to sleep long and sound,\" he answered; \"for I've been\nsea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.\"\n\"My friend and companion,\" said I, rising from the sofa, \"is absent;\nyou must have his room.\"\n\"He won't come back to-morrow; will he?\"\n\"No,\" said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost\nefforts; \"not to-morrow.\"\n\"Because, look'ee here, dear boy,\" he said, dropping his voice, and\nlaying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, \"caution is\nnecessary.\"\n\"How do you mean?

If I had loved him\ninstead of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the\nstrongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with\nthe strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary,\nit would have been better, for his preservation would then have\nnaturally and tenderly addressed my heart.\nMy first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen\nfrom without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did\nso, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I\nsaw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal\nagain. It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to\nfile at his leg.\nWhen I had gone into Herbert's room, and had shut off any other\ncommunication between it and the staircase than through the room in\nwhich our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to\nbed? He said yes, but asked me for some of my \"gentleman's linen\" to\nput on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and\nmy blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me\ngood-night.\nI got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire\nin the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to\ngo to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it\nwas not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked\nI was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.\nMiss Havisham's intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not\ndesigned for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a\nsting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to\npractise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first\nsmarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,\u2014it was for the\nconvict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out\nof those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,\nthat I had deserted Joe.\nI would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to\nBiddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense\nof my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every\nconsideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that\nI should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could\nnever, never, undo what I had done.\nIn every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers.

Difficult as it is in a\nlarge city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is\nconscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that\nany of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who\nwere passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty\nwhen I turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate\nwith us, nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the\nfountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and,\nwhen I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I\nlived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and\nlifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.\nHerbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so\nblessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound\nwords of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the\nquestion, What was to be done?\nThe chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had\nstood,\u2014for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in\none unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with\nhis pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,\nand what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,\u2014I say his\nchair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but\nnext moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had\nno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\npatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that\nconfidence without shaping a syllable.\n\"What,\" said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,\u2014\"what is\nto be done?\"\n\"My poor dear Handel,\" he replied, holding his head, \"I am too stunned\nto think.\"\n\"So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be\ndone. He is intent upon various new expenses,\u2014horses, and carriages,\nand lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.\"\n\"You mean that you can't accept\u2014\"\n\"How can I?\" I interposed, as Herbert paused. \"Think of him! Look at\nhim!\"\nAn involuntary shudder passed over both of us.\n\"Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to\nme, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!\"\n\"My poor dear Handel,\" Herbert repeated.\n\"Then,\" said I, \"after all, stopping short here, never taking another\npenny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily\nin debt,\u2014very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,\u2014and I have\nbeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.\"\n\"Well, well, well!\" Herbert remonstrated. \"Don't say fit for nothing.\"\n\"What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that\nis, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but\nfor the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.\"\nOf course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a\nwarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.\n\"Anyhow, my dear Handel,\" said he presently, \"soldiering won't do. If\nyou were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose you\nwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have\nalready had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!\nBesides, it's absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker's\nhouse, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you\nknow.\"\nPoor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.\n\"But there is another question,\" said Herbert. \"This is an ignorant,\ndetermined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he\nseems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce\ncharacter.\"\n\"I know he is,\" I returned. \"Let me tell you what evidence I have seen\nof it.\" And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of\nthat encounter with the other convict.\n\"See, then,\" said Herbert; \"think of this! He comes here at the peril\nof his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea. In the moment of\nrealisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from\nunder his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.\nDo you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?\"\n\"I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night\nof his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\nputting himself in the way of being taken.\"\n\"Then you may rely upon it,\" said Herbert, \"that there would be great\ndanger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he\nremains in England, and that would be his reckless course if you\nforsook him.\"\nI was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me",

      "text": "\"Dear boy and Pip's comrade. I am not a-going fur to tell you my life\nlike a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I'll\nput it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in\njail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you've got it.\nThat's _my_ life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,\narter Pip stood my friend.\n\"I've been done everything to, pretty well\u2014except hanged. I've been\nlocked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I've been carted here and\ncarted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and\nstuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I've no more\nnotion where I was born than you have\u2014if so much. I first become aware\nof myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had\nrun away from me\u2014a man\u2014a tinker\u2014and he'd took the fire with him, and\nleft me wery cold.\n\"I know'd my name to be Magwitch, chrisen'd Abel. How did I know it?\nMuch as I know'd the birds' names in the hedges to be chaffinch,\nsparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as\nthe birds' names come out true, I supposed mine did.\n\"So fur as I could find, there warn't a soul that see young Abel\nMagwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at\nhim, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up,\ntook up, to that extent that I reg'larly grow'd up took up.\n\"This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as\nmuch to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for\nthere warn't many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the\nname of being hardened. 'This is a terrible hardened one,' they says to\nprison wisitors, picking out me. 'May be said to live in jails, this\nboy.' Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured\nmy head, some on 'em,\u2014they had better a measured my stomach,\u2014and others\non 'em giv me tracts what I couldn't read, and made me speeches what I\ncouldn't understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But\nwhat the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach,\nmustn't I?\u2014Howsomever, I'm a getting low, and I know what's due. Dear\nboy and Pip's comrade, don't you be afeerd of me being low.\n\"Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,\u2014though\nthat warn't as often as you may think, till you put the question\nwhether you would ha' been over-ready to give me work yourselves,\u2014a bit\nof a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a\nhaymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don't pay and\nlead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a\nTraveller's Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs,\nlearnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a\npenny a time learnt me to write. I warn't locked up as often now as\nformerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.\n\"At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted\nwi' a man whose skull I'd crack wi' this poker, like the claw of a\nlobster, if I'd got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and\nthat's the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch,\naccording to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last\nnight.\n\"He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he'd been to a public\nboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was\na dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the\nnight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth\nthat I know'd on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when\nI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a\nsporting one) called him out, and said, 'I think this is a man that\nmight suit you,'\u2014meaning I was.\n\"Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a\nwatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of\nclothes.\n\"'To judge from appearances, you're out of luck,' says Compeyson to me.\n\"'Yes, master, and I've never been in it much.' (I had come out of\nKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have\nbeen for something else; but it warn't.)\n\"'Luck changes,' says Compeyson; 'perhaps yours is going to change.'\n\"I says, 'I hope it may be so. There's room.'\n\"'What can you do?' says Compeyson.\n\"'Eat and drink,' I says; 'if you'll find the materials.'\n\"Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five\nshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\n\"I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on\nto be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson's business in which\nwe was to go pardners? Compeyson's business was the swindling,\nhandwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts\nof traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs\nout of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was\nCompeyson's business. He'd no more heart than a iron file, he was as\ncold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.\n\"There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,\u2014not as\nbeing so chrisen'd, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a\nshadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a\nrich lady some years afore, and they'd made a pot of money by it; but\nCompeyson betted and gamed, and he'd have run through the king's taxes.\nSo, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,\nand Compeyson's wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity\non him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and\nnobody.\n\"I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn't; and I won't pretend I\nwas partick'ler\u2014for where 'ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?\nSo I begun wi' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur\nlived at the top of Compeyson's house (over nigh Brentford it was), and\nCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in\ncase he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled\nthe account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a\ntearing down into Compeyson's parlour late at night, in only a flannel\ngown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson's wife,\n'Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can't get rid of\nher. She's all in white,' he says, 'wi' white flowers in her hair, and\nshe's awful mad, and she's got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she\nsays she'll put it on me at five in the morning.'\n\"Says Compeyson: 'Why, you fool, don't you know she's got a living\nbody? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door,\nor in at the window, and up the stairs?'\n\"'I don't know how she's there,' says Arthur, shivering dreadful with\nthe horrors, 'but she's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,\nawful mad. And over where her heart's broke\u2014_you_ broke it!\u2014there's\ndrops of blood.'\n\"Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. 'Go up alonger this\ndrivelling sick man,' he says to his wife, 'and Magwitch, lend her a\nhand, will you?' But he never come nigh himself.\n\"Compeyson's wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most\ndreadful. 'Why look at her!' he cries out. 'She's a shaking the shroud\nat me! Don't you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain't it awful to see her\nso mad?' Next he cries, 'She'll put it on me, and then I'm done for!\nTake it away from her, take it away!' And then he catched hold of us,\nand kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed\nI see her myself.\n\"Compeyson's wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the\nhorrors off, and by and by he quieted. 'O, she's gone! Has her keeper\nbeen for her?' he says. 'Yes,' says Compeyson's wife. 'Did you tell him\nto lock her and bar her in?' 'Yes.' 'And to take that ugly thing away\nfrom her?' 'Yes, yes, all right.' 'You're a good creetur,' he says,\n'don't leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!'\n\"He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and\nthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, 'Here she is! She's\ngot the shroud again. She's unfolding it. She's coming out of the\ncorner. She's coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you\u2014one of each\nside\u2014don't let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.\nDon't let her throw it over my shoulders. Don't let her lift me up to\nget it round me. She's lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he lifted\nhimself up hard, and was dead.\n\"Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and me\nwas soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own\nbook,\u2014this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade\non.\n\"Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done\u2014which 'ud\ntake a week\u2014I'll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip's comrade, that\nthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always\nin debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a\ngetting into danger. He was younger than me, but he'd got craft, and\nhe'd got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no\nmercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi'\u2014Stop though! I ain't\nbrought _her_ in\u2014\"\nHe looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in\nthe book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and\nspread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them\non again.\n\"There ain't no need to go into it,\" he said, looking round once more.\n\"The time wi' Compeyson was a'most as hard a time as ever I had; that\nsaid, all's said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for\nmisdemeanor, while with Compeyson?\"\nI answered, No.\n\"Well!\" he said, \"I _was_, and got convicted. As to took up on\nsuspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that\nit lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both\ncommitted for felony,\u2014on a charge of putting stolen notes in\ncirculation,\u2014and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me,\n'Separate defences, no communication,' and that was all. And I was so\nmiserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on\nmy back, afore I could get Jaggers.\n\"When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman\nCompeyson looked, wi' his curly hair and his black clothes and his\nwhite pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.\nWhen the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand,\nI noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the\nevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had\ncome for'ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the\nmoney had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work\nthe thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see\nthe plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, 'My lord and\ngentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your\neyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be\nspoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to\nas such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here\ntransactions, and only suspected; t'other, the elder, always seen in\n'em and always wi' his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is\nbut one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is\nmuch the worst one?' And such-like. And when it come to character,\nwarn't it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn't it his\nschoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn't it him as\nhad been know'd by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to\nhis disadvantage? And warn't it me as had been tried afore, and as had\nbeen know'd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when\nit come to speech-making, warn't it Compeyson as could speak to 'em wi'\nhis face dropping every now and then into his white\npocket-handkercher,\u2014ah! and wi' verses in his speech, too,\u2014and warn't\nit me as could only say, 'Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most\nprecious rascal'? And when the verdict come, warn't it Compeyson as was\nrecommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and\ngiving up all the information he could agen me, and warn't it me as got\nnever a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, 'Once out of\nthis court, I'll smash that face of yourn!' ain't it Compeyson as prays\nthe Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And\nwhen we're sentenced, ain't it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,\nand ain't it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so\nwell, and ain't it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of\nwiolent passion, likely to come to worse?\"\nHe had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked\nit, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching\nout his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, \"I ain't a-going\nto be low, dear boy!\"\nHe had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped\nhis face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.\n[Illustration]\n\"I had said to Compeyson that I'd smash that face of his, and I swore\nLord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I\ncouldn't get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him\nand hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at\nhim, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn't a\nstrong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I\nescaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there,\nenvying them as was in 'em and all over, when I first see my boy!\"\nHe regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent\nto me again, though I had felt great pity for him.\n\"By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them\nmarshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to\nget quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him\ndown. I smashed his face. 'And now,' says I 'as the worst thing I can\ndo, caring nothing for myself, I'll drag you back.' And I'd have swum\noff, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I'd a got him\naboard without the soldiers.\n\"Of course he'd much the best of it to the last,\u2014his character was so\ngood. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous\nintentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought\nto trial again, and sent for life. I didn't stop for life, dear boy and\nPip's comrade, being here.\"\nHe wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took his\ntangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his\nbutton-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.\n\"Is he dead?\" I asked, after a silence.\n\"Is who dead, dear boy?\"\n\"Compeyson.\"\n\"He hopes _I_ am, if he's alive, you may be sure,\" with a fierce look.\n\"I never heerd no more of him.\"\nHerbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He\nsoftly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his\neyes on the fire, and I read in it:\u2014\n\"Young Havisham's name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed\nto be Miss Havisham's lover.\"\nI shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by;\nbut we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he\nstood smoking by the fire.",

It was a\nvery lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into\nthe coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I\nordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very\nwell knew why he had come there.\nPretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had\nnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of\ncoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which\nit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly\nirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\nfire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my\nhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to\nstir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.\n\"Is this a cut?\" said Mr. Drummle.\n\"Oh!\" said I, poker in hand; \"it's you, is it? How do you do? I was\nwondering who it was, who kept the fire off.\"\nWith that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself\nside by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the\nfire.\n\"You have just come down?\" said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away\nwith his shoulder.\n\"Yes,\" said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.\n\"Beastly place,\" said Drummle. \"Your part of the country, I think?\"\n\"Yes,\" I assented. \"I am told it's very like your Shropshire.\"\n\"Not in the least like it,\" said Drummle.\nHere Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.\nDrummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.\n\"Have you been here long?\" I asked, determined not to yield an inch of\nthe fire.\n\"Long enough to be tired of it,\" returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,\nbut equally determined.\n\"Do you stay here long?\"\n\"Can't say,\" answered Mr. Drummle. \"Do you?\"\n\"Can't say,\" said I.\nI felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle's\nshoulder had claimed another hair's breadth of room, I should have\njerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged\na similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.\nHe whistled a little. So did I.\n\"Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?\" said Drummle.\n\"Yes. What of that?\" said I.\nMr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, \"Oh!\"\nand laughed.\n\"Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?\"\n\"No,\" said he, \"not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the\nsaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way\nvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses\u2014and\nsmithies\u2014and that. Waiter!\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Is that horse of mine ready?\"\n\"Brought round to the door, sir.\"\n\"I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won't ride to-day; the weather\nwon't do.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\"And I don't dine, because I'm going to dine at the lady's.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\nThen, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\ngreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\nexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\nrobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\nhim on the fire.\nOne thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\ncame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\nsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\nhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\nthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle's\nwas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\nstood our ground.\n\"Have you been to the Grove since?\" said Drummle.",

But I think she did not. I think that,\nin the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.\"\nI saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\nsat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\n\"It seems,\" said Estella, very calmly, \"that there are sentiments,\nfancies,\u2014I don't know how to call them,\u2014which I am not able to\ncomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\nof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\nnothing there. I don't care for what you say at all.

Surely it is not in Nature.\"\n\"It is in _my_ nature,\" she returned. And then she added, with a stress\nupon the words, \"It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\ndifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can\ndo no more.\"\n\"Is it not true,\" said I, \"that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\npursuing you?\"\n\"It is quite true,\" she replied, referring to him with the indifference\nof utter contempt.\n\"That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\nyou this very day?\"\nShe seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\n\"Quite true.\"\n\"You cannot love him, Estella!\"\nHer fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\n\"What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do\nnot mean what I say?\"\n\"You would never marry him, Estella?\"\nShe looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\nwork in her hands. Then she said, \"Why not tell you the truth? I am\ngoing to be married to him.\"\nI dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\nthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\nher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\nghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my\npassionate hurry and grief.\n\"Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\nfatal step. Put me aside for ever,\u2014you have done so, I well know,\u2014but\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\ngives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\nto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\nlove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as\ndearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can\nbear it better, for your sake!\"\nMy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\nbeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\nintelligible to her own mind.\n\"I am going,\" she said again, in a gentler voice, \"to be married to\nhim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\nmarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\nadoption? It is my own act.\"\n\"Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?\"\n\"On whom should I fling myself away?\" she retorted, with a smile.\n\"Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\npeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\ndone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading me\ninto what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\nwait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\nhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say\nno more. We shall never understand each other.\"\n\"Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!\" I urged, in despair.\n\"Don't be afraid of my being a blessing to him,\" said Estella; \"I shall\nnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\nboy\u2014or man?\"\n\"O Estella!\" I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\nwhat I would to restrain them; \"even if I remained in England and could\nhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle's wife?\"\n\"Nonsense,\" she returned,\u2014\"nonsense. This will pass in no time.\"\n\"Never, Estella!\"\n\"You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.\"\n\"Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\nhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\nin every prospect I have ever seen since,\u2014on the river, on the sails of\nthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the\ndarkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You\nhave been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever\nbecome acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London\nbuildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be\ndisplaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to\nme, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my\nlife, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the\nlittle good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I\nassociate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to\nthat always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me\nfeel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!\"",

When I had lain awake a little while, those\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\naudible.

But\nall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\nand when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\nquestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme.

But\nit either is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being.\"\nAs I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying\nas much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out\nof his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I\ntold him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to\nask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\ndeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\nbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\nnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\nonce, to put my question.\n\"You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\nCompeyson?\"\nHe answered with one other nod.\n\"Is he living?\"\nOne other nod.\n\"Is he in London?\"\nHe gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\nme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\n\"Now,\" said Wemmick, \"questioning being over,\" which he emphasised and\nrepeated for my guidance, \"I come to what I did, after hearing what I\nheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\nClarriker's to find Mr. Herbert.\"\n\"And him you found?\" said I, with great anxiety.\n\"And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\ndetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody\u2014Tom,\nJack, or Richard\u2014being about the chambers, or about the immediate\nneighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\nwhile you were out of the way.\"\n\"He would be greatly puzzled what to do?\"\n\"He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my\nopinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too\nfar out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under\nexisting circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you\nare once in it. Don't break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things\nslacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.\"",

He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\ncourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\nPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\nbow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\nare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?\"\n\"Not personally,\" said I.\nThe truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\nwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\npresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such very\nmoderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the\nstate of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time\nbefore I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert's\nprospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful\nphilosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not\nbeen very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;\nand thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara's esteem,\nand although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged\nmessages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I\ndid not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.\n\"The house with the bow-window,\" said Wemmick, \"being by the\nriver-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and\nbeing kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished\nupper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that\nas a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very\nwell of it, for three reasons I'll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.\nIt's altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual\nheap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near it\nyourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,\nthrough Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might be\nprudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a\nforeign packet-boat, there he is\u2014ready.\"\nMuch comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\nagain, and begged him to proceed.\n\"Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,\nand by nine o'clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or\nRichard,\u2014whichever it may be,\u2014you and I don't want to know,\u2014quite\nsuccessfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was\nsummoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and\ncornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that\nit was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself\nabout your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off\nand quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;\nand for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last",

Don't let anything happen to the portable property.\"\nQuite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I\nforbore to try.\n\"Time's up,\" said Wemmick, \"and I must be off.

That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly\nwoman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was\nimmediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into the\nparlour and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very\nfamiliar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room\nand region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at the\ncorner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the\nchimney-piece, and the coloured engravings on the wall, representing\nthe death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George\nthe Third in a state coachman's wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots,\non the terrace at Windsor.\n\"All is well, Handel,\" said Herbert, \"and he is quite satisfied, though\neager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you'll wait\ntill she comes down, I'll make you known to her, and then we'll go\nupstairs. _That's_ her father.\"\nI had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably\nexpressed the fact in my countenance.\n\"I am afraid he is a sad old rascal,\" said Herbert, smiling, \"but I\nhave never seen him. Don't you smell rum? He is always at it.\"\n\"At rum?\" said I.\n\"Yes,\" returned Herbert, \"and you may suppose how mild it makes his\ngout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his\nroom, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and\n_will_ weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler's shop.\"\nWhile he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and\nthen died away.\n\"What else can be the consequence,\" said Herbert, in explanation, \"if\nhe _will_ cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand\u2014and\neverywhere else\u2014can't expect to get through a Double Gloucester without\nhurting himself.\"\nHe seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious\nroar.\n\"To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs.\nWhimple,\" said Herbert, \"for of course people in general won't stand\nthat noise. A curious place, Handel; isn't it?\"\nIt was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.\n\"Mrs. Whimple,\" said Herbert, when I told him so, \"is the best of\nhousewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her\nmotherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no\nrelation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.\"\n\"Surely that's not his name, Herbert?\"\n\"No, no,\" said Herbert, \"that's my name for him. His name is Mr.\nBarley. But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother\nto love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself\nor anybody else about her family!\"\nHerbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he\nfirst knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at\nan establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home to\nnurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the\nmotherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with\nequal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that\nnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by\nreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject\nmore psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser's stores.\nAs we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley's sustained\ngrowl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door\nopened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came\nin with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the\nbasket, and presented, blushing, as \"Clara.\" She really was a most\ncharming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that\ntruculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.\n\"Look here,\" said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate\nand tender smile, after we had talked a little; \"here's poor Clara's\nsupper, served out every night. Here's her allowance of bread, and\nhere's her slice of cheese, and here's her rum,\u2014which I drink. This is\nMr. Barley's breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two\nmutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two\nounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It's\nstewed up together, and taken hot, and it's a nice thing for the gout,\nI should think!\"\nThere was something so natural and winning in Clara's resigned way of\nlooking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and\nsomething so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of\nyielding herself to Herbert's embracing arm; and something so gentle in\nher, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks's Basin,\nand the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the\nbeam,\u2014that I would not have undone the engagement between her and\nHerbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.",

Upon this Clara said to Herbert,\n\"Papa wants me, darling!\" and ran away.\n\"There is an unconscionable old shark for you!\" said Herbert. \"What do\nyou suppose he wants now, Handel?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said I. \"Something to drink?\"\n\"That's it!\" cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary\nmerit. \"He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.\nWait a moment, and you'll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There he\ngoes!\" Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. \"Now,\" said\nHerbert, as it was succeeded by silence, \"he's drinking. Now,\" said\nHerbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, \"he's down again\non his back!\"\nClara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to\nsee our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley's door, he was heard hoarsely\nmuttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the\nfollowing Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something\nquite the reverse:\u2014\n\"Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here's old Bill Barley. Here's old Bill Barley,\nbless your eyes. Here's old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the\nLord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,\nhere's your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.\"\nIn this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley\nwould commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while\nit was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which\nwas fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.\nIn his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and\nairy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found\nProvis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel\nnone that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was\nsoftened,\u2014indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never\nafterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.\nThe opportunity that the day's rest had given me for reflection had\nresulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting\nCompeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might\notherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own\ndestruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his\nfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick's judgment\nand sources of information?\n\"Ay, ay, dear boy!\" he answered, with a grave nod, \"Jaggers knows.\"\n\"Then, I have talked with Wemmick,\" said I, \"and have come to tell you\nwhat caution he gave me and what advice.\"\nThis I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told\nhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or\nprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that\nmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping\nclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had\nsaid about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time\ncame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might\nbe safest in Wemmick's judgment. What was to follow that I did not\ntouch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it\nin my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in\ndeclared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by\nenlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled\nand difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it\nwere no worse?\nHe could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\ncoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\nventure. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had\nvery little fear of his safety with such good help.",

The\nwindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark\nand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the\nfountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between\nme and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedside\nwhen he came in,\u2014for I went straight to bed, dispirited and\nfatigued,\u2014made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,\nhe looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as\nsolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.\nNext day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat\nwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her\nwithin a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and\npractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in\ncold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\nout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\nhours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\nLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But\nI knew well enough how to 'shoot' the bridge after seeing it done, and\nso began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to\nErith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were\npulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the\nblind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less\nfrequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single\nword of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there\nwas cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being\nwatched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning\npersons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.\nIn short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in\nhiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to\nstand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,\nand to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards\nClara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,\nand that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going\nswiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.",

I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide,\nand had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had\nbecome foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back\namong the shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I\nhad seen the signal in his window, All well.\nAs it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort\nmyself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and\nsolitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would\nafterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved\nhis questionable triumph was in that water-side neighbourhood (it is\nnowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that\nMr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the\ncontrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominously\nheard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection\nwith a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen\nhim as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red\nbrick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.\nI dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,\nwhere there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every\nhalf-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the\nknives,\u2014to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the\nLord Mayor's dominions which is not geographical,\u2014and wore out the time\nin dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of\ndinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.\nThere, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty's service,\u2014a most\nexcellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so\ntight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,\u2014who knocked all\nthe little men's hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and\nbrave, and who wouldn't hear of anybody's paying taxes, though he was\nvery patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in\nthe cloth, and on that property married a young person in\nbed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of\nPortsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach\nto rub their own hands and shake everybody else's, and sing \"Fill,\nfill!\" A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn't fill, or\ndo anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly\nstated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed\nto two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so\neffectually done (the Swab family having considerable political\ninfluence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then\nit was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white\nhat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a\ngridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down\nfrom behind with the gridiron whom he couldn't confute with what he had\noverheard. This led to Mr. Wopsle's (who had never been heard of\nbefore) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of\ngreat power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all\nto go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down\nthe Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. The\nboatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on\nthe Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your\nHonour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,\nconceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into\na dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that\ncorner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of\nme.\nThe second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in\nthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.\nWopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\ncountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in\nthe manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.\nBut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,\nthe Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,\u2014on account of\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of\nhis daughter's heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a\nflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,\u2014summoned a sententious\nEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,\nafter an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a\nhigh-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.\nThe business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked\nat, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various\ncolours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with\ngreat surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he\nwere lost in amazement.\nThere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.\nWopsle's eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\nmind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat\nthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large\nwatch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking of\nit when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him\nwaiting for me near the door.\n\"How do you do?\" said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the\nstreet together. \"I saw that you saw me.\"\n\"Saw you, Mr. Pip!\" he returned. \"Yes, of course I saw you. But who\nelse was there?\"\n\"Who else?\"\n\"It is the strangest thing,\" said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost\nlook again; \"and yet I could swear to him.\"\nBecoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.\n\"Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,\"\nsaid Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, \"I can't be positive;\nyet I think I should.\"\nInvoluntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me\nwhen I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.\n\"Oh! He can't be in sight,\" said Mr. Wopsle. \"He went out before I went\noff. I saw him go.\"\nHaving the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected\nthis poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some\nadmission. Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but\nsaid nothing.\n\"I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw\nthat you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a\nghost.\"\nMy former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak\nyet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on\nto induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was\nperfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.\n\"I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is\nso very strange! You'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I\ncould hardly believe it myself, if you told me.\"\n\"Indeed?\" said I.\n\"No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas\nDay, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery's, and some\nsoldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?\"\n\"I remember it very well.\"\n\"And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that\nwe joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took\nthe lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?\"\n\"I remember it all very well.\" Better than he thought,\u2014except the last\nclause.\n\"And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that\nthere was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been\nseverely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?\"\n\"I see it all before me.\"\n\"And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,\nand that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,\nwith the torchlight shining on their faces,\u2014I am particular about\nthat,\u2014with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an\nouter ring of dark night all about us?\"\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"I remember all that.\"\n\"Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I\nsaw him over your shoulder.\"\n\"Steady!\" I thought. I asked him then, \"Which of the two do you suppose\nyou saw?\"\n\"The one who had been mauled,\" he answered readily, \"and I'll swear I\nsaw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.\"\n\"This is very curious!\" said I, with the best assumption I could put on\nof its being nothing more to me. \"Very curious indeed!\"\nI cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation\nthrew me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson's\nhaving been behind me \"like a ghost.\" For if he had ever been out of my\nthoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was\nin those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I\nshould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I\nhad shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had\nfound him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,\nbecause I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger\nthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.\nI put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He\ncould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.\nIt was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to\nidentify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me,\nand known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How\nwas he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,\nin black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I\nbelieved not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no\nespecial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a\nface at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.\nWhen Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I\nextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate\nrefreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was\nbetween twelve and one o'clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates\nwere shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home.\nHerbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.\nBut there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what\nI had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his\nhint. As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to\nthe Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I\nwent to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.\nHerbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very\ncautious. And we were very cautious indeed,\u2014more cautious than before,\nif that were possible,\u2014and I for my part never went near Chinks's\nBasin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank",

      "text": "hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the\nbusiness of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers's fire, its rising\nand falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were\nplaying a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,\nfat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a\ncorner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance\nof a host of hanged clients.\nWe went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,\nas soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have\nthought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much\nas a look to Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no\nobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it\nwas not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he\nraised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if\nthere were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.\n\"Did you send that note of Miss Havisham's to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?\" Mr.\nJaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.\n\"No, sir,\" returned Wemmick; \"it was going by post, when you brought\nMr. Pip into the office. Here it is.\" He handed it to his principal\ninstead of to me.\n\"It's a note of two lines, Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, \"sent\nup to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your\naddress. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of\nbusiness you mentioned to her. You'll go down?\"\n\"Yes,\" said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in\nthose terms.\n\"When do you think of going down?\"\n\"I have an impending engagement,\" said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was\nputting fish into the post-office, \"that renders me rather uncertain of\nmy time. At once, I think.\"\n\"If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,\" said Wemmick to Mr.\nJaggers, \"he needn't write an answer, you know.\"\nReceiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I\nsettled that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass\nof wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not\nat me.\n\"So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"has played his\ncards. He has won the pool.\"\nIt was as much as I could do to assent.\n\"Hah! He is a promising fellow\u2014in his way\u2014but he may not have it all\nhis own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to\nbe found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her\u2014\"\n\"Surely,\" I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, \"you do not\nseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?\"\n\"I didn't say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and\nbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be\na question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance work\nto give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such\ncircumstances, because it's a toss-up between two results.\"\n\"May I ask what they are?\"\n\"A fellow like our friend the Spider,\" answered Mr. Jaggers, \"either\nbeats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but\nhe either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick _his_ opinion.\"\n\"Either beats or cringes,\" said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself\nto me.\n\"So here's to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,\" said Mr. Jaggers, taking a\ndecanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of\nus and for himself, \"and may the question of supremacy be settled to\nthe lady's satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady _and_ the\ngentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow\nyou are to-day!\"\nShe was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the\ntable. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,\nnervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers,\nas she spoke, arrested my attention.\n\"What's the matter?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,\" said I, \"was rather\npainful to me.\"\nThe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood\nlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did\ngo. Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and\nsuch hands on a memorable occasion very lately!\nHe dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those\nhands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I\ncompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and\na stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\nhousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\nme when I last walked\u2014not alone\u2014in the ruined garden, and through the\ndeserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I\nsaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach\nwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\nlightning, when I had passed in a carriage\u2014not alone\u2014through a sudden\nglare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association\nhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\nwanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\nchance swift from Estella's name to the fingers with their knitting\naction, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this\nwoman was Estella's mother.\nMr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed\nthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said\nthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the\nwine again, and went on with his dinner.\nOnly twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the\nroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands\nwere Estella's hands, and her eyes were Estella's eyes, and if she had\nreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less\nsure that my conviction was the truth.",

As to the quantity of wine,\nhis post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office\nfor its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong\ntwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.\nWe took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping\namong Mr. Jaggers's stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right\ntwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\nGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was\nwalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had\nevaporated into the evening air.\n\"Well!\" said Wemmick, \"that's over! He's a wonderful man, without his\nliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine\nwith him,\u2014and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.\"\nI felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.\n\"Wouldn't say it to anybody but yourself,\" he answered. \"I know that\nwhat is said between you and me goes no further.\"\nI asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, Mrs.\nBentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of\nthe Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned\nMiss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll\nof the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.\n\"Wemmick,\" said I, \"do you remember telling me, before I first went to\nMr. Jaggers's private house, to notice that housekeeper?\"\n\"Did I?\" he replied. \"Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,\" he added,\nsuddenly, \"I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.\"\n\"A wild beast tamed, you called her.\"\n\"And what do _you_ call her?\"\n\"The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?\"\n\"That's his secret. She has been with him many a long year.\"\n\"I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in\nbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\ngoes no further.\"\n\"Well!\" Wemmick replied, \"I don't know her story,\u2014that is, I don't know\nall of it. But what I do know I'll tell you. We are in our private and\npersonal capacities, of course.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\nmurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\nwas up, as you may suppose.\"\n\"But she was acquitted.\"\n\"Mr. Jaggers was for her,\" pursued Wemmick, with a look full of\nmeaning, \"and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a\ndesperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and\nhe worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to\nhave made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day\nfor many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial\nwhere he couldn't work it himself, sat under counsel, and\u2014every one\nknew\u2014put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,\u2014a\nwoman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.\nIt was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman\nin Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick\n(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of\njealousy. The murdered woman,\u2014more a match for the man, certainly, in\npoint of years\u2014was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had\nbeen a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched\nand torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,\nthere was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this\nwoman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.\nJaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,\" said Wemmick,\ntouching me on the sleeve, \"that he never dwelt upon the strength of\nher hands then, though he sometimes does now.\"\nI had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\nparty.\n\"Well, sir!\" Wemmick went on; \"it happened\u2014happened, don't you\nsee?\u2014that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her\napprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\nparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a\nbruise or two about her,\u2014nothing for a tramp,\u2014but the backs of her\nhands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?\nNow, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of\nbrambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not\nhave got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles\nwere actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the\nfact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have\nbeen broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little\nspots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made\nwas this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that\nshe was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the\nmurder, frantically destroyed her child by this man\u2014some three years\nold\u2014to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:\n\"We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and\nwe show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and\nyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept\nall consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have\nscratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder\nof her child; why don't you? As to this case, if you _will_ have\nscratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted\nfor them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented\nthem?\" \"To sum up, sir,\" said Wemmick, \"Mr. Jaggers was altogether too\nmany for the jury, and they gave in.\"\n\"Has she been in his service ever since?\"\n\"Yes; but not only that,\" said Wemmick, \"she went into his service\nimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since\nbeen taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was\ntamed from the beginning.\"\n\"Do you remember the sex of the child?\"\n\"Said to have been a girl.\"\n\"You have nothing more to say to me to-night?\"\n\"Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.\"\nWe exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for",

      "text": "Putting Miss Havisham's note in my pocket, that it might serve as my\ncredentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her\nwaywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I\nwent down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway\nHouse, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for\nI sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to\nleave it in the same manner.\nThe best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet\nechoing courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old\nmonks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong\nwalls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,\nwere almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral\nchimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried\non avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell\nof the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the\nrooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high\ntrees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was\nchanged, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.\nAn elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who\nlived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the\ngate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,\nand I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was\nnot in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.\nLooking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on\nthe hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the\ncontemplation of, the ashy fire.\nDoing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old\nchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There\nwas an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to\npity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could\ncharge her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in\nthe progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked\nfortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in\na low voice, \"Is it real?\"\n\"It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost\nno time.\"\n\"Thank you. Thank you.\"\nAs I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I\nremarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.\n\"I want,\" she said, \"to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when\nyou were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But\nperhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my\nheart?\"\nWhen I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous\nright hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it\nagain before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.\n\"You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do\nsomething useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it\nnot?\"\n\"Something that I would like done very much.\"\n\"What is it?\"\nI began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had\nnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking\nin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be\nso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed\nthat she was conscious of the fact.\n\"Do you break off,\" she asked then, with her former air of being afraid\nof me, \"because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?\"\n\"No, no,\" I answered, \"how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped\nbecause I thought you were not following what I said.\"\n\"Perhaps I was not,\" she answered, putting a hand to her head. \"Begin\nagain, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.\"\nShe set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\nhabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\nforcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her\nhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in\nthis I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)\ninvolved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they\nwere the weighty secrets of another.\n\"So!\" said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. \"And\nhow much money is wanting to complete the purchase?\"\nI was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. \"Nine\nhundred pounds.\"\n\"If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as\nyou have kept your own?\"\n\"Quite as faithfully.\"\n\"And your mind will be more at rest?\"\n\"Much more at rest.\"\n\"Are you very unhappy now?\"\nShe asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an\nunwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my\nvoice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and\nsoftly laid her forehead on it.\n\"I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of\ndisquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.\"\nAfter a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire\nagain.\n\"It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\nunhappiness. Is it true?\"\n\"Too true.\"\n\"Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as\ndone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?\"\n\"Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the\ntone of the question. But there is nothing.\"\nShe presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\nfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung\nfrom her neck.\n\"You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?\"\n\"Quite. I dined with him yesterday.\"\n\"This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your\nirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if\nyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it\nto you.\"\n\"Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving\nit from him.\"\nShe read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\nreceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled\nagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\npencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without\nlooking at me.\n\"My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, \"I\nforgive her,\" though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\nit!\"\n\"O Miss Havisham,\" said I, \"I can do it now. There have been sore\nmistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want\nforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.\"\nShe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,\nand, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees\nat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have\nbeen raised to heaven from her mother's side.\nTo see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\ngave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got\nmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of\nmine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and\nwept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that\nthe relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was\nnot kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\n\"O!\" she cried, despairingly. \"What have I done! What have I done!\"\n\"If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me\nanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances.\nIs she married?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nIt was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house\nhad told me so.\n\"What have I done! What have I done!\" She wrung her hands, and crushed\nher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. \"What\nhave I done!\"\nI knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\nthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found\nvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light of\nday, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,\nher mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew\nequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her\npunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this\nearth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become\na master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,\nthe vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been\ncurses in this world?\n\"Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a\nlooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know\nwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!\" And so again,\ntwenty, fifty times over, What had she done!\n\"Miss Havisham,\" I said, when her cry had died away, \"you may dismiss\nme from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and\nif you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\npart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.\"\n\"Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip\u2014my dear!\" There was an earnest womanly\ncompassion for me in her new affection. \"My dear! Believe this: when\nshe first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At\nfirst, I meant no more.\"\n\"Well, well!\" said I. \"I hope so.\"\n\"But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did\nworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,\nand with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and\npoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.\"\n\"Better,\" I could not help saying, \"to have left her a natural heart,\neven to be bruised or broken.\"\nWith that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and\nthen burst out again, What had she done!\n\"If you knew all my story,\" she pleaded, \"you would have some\ncompassion for me and a better understanding of me.\"\n\"Miss Havisham,\" I answered, as delicately as I could, \"I believe I may\nsay that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first\nleft this neighbourhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration,\nand I hope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed\nbetween us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to\nEstella? Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?\"\nShe was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and\nher head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and\nreplied, \"Go on.\"\n\"Whose child was Estella?\"\nShe shook her head.\n\"You don't know?\"\nShe shook her head again.\n\"But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?\"\n\"Brought her here.\"\n\"Will you tell me how that came about?\"\nShe answered in a low whisper and with caution: \"I had been shut up in\nthese rooms a long time (I don't know how long; you know what time the\nclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear\nand love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent for\nhim to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the\nnewspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would\nlook about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here\nasleep, and I called her Estella.\"\n\"Might I ask her age then?\"\n\"Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an\norphan and I adopted her.\"\nSo convinced I was of that woman's being her mother, that I wanted no\nevidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I\nthought, the connection here was clear and straight.\nWhat more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had\nsucceeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew\nof Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No\nmatter with what other words we parted; we parted.\nTwilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I\ncalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I\nwould not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before\nleaving. For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again,\nand I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.",

      "text": "By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which\nthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and\nleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on\nend, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by\nthe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the\npaths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary\nall!\nTaking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little\ndoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at\nthe opposite door,\u2014not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started\nand swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was\nencumbered with a growth of fungus,\u2014when I turned my head to look back.\nA childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of\nthe slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to\nthe beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam\nshuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,\u2014though to be\nsure I was there in an instant.\nThe mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this\nillusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an\nindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I\nhad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on\ninto the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let\nme out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go\nupstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I\nhad left her. I took the latter course and went up.\nI looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in\nthe ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back\ntowards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly\naway, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw\nher running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about\nher, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.\nI had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.\nThat I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over\nher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same\npurpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,\nand all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the\nground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered\nher, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,\u2014that this\noccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or\nthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the\nfloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were\nfloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded\nbridal dress.\nThen, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\naway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries\nat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like\na prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or\nwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the\nflames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her\ngarments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.\nShe was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even\ntouched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if I\nunreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire\nwould break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon's\ncoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my\nhands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of\nfeeling.\nOn examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,\nbut that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay\nmainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon's directions, her bed was\ncarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to\nbe well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again,\nan hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her\nstick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.\nThough every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she still\nhad something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had\ncovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with a\nwhite sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that\nhad been and was changed was still upon her.\nI found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I\ngot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next\npost. Miss Havisham's family I took upon myself; intending to\ncommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he\nliked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert,\nas soon as I returned to town.\nThere was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had\nhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she\nbegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that\nshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, \"What have I done!\"\nAnd then, \"When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like\nmine.\" And then, \"Take the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive\nher!'\" She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she\nsometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in\nanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.\nAs I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that\npressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could\nnot drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I\nwould return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and\nbeing taken up clear of the town. At about six o'clock of the morning,\ntherefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as\nthey said, not stopping for being touched, \"Take the pencil and write\nunder my name, 'I forgive her.'\"",

My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less\nseverely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames\nhad set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My\nright hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It\nwas bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand\nand arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like\na cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had\nbeen caught by the fire, but not my head or face.\nWhen Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came\nback to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He\nwas the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,\nand steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put\nthem on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful\nfor.\nAt first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I\nmight say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the\nflames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I dozed\nfor a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham's cries, and by her\nrunning at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain of\nthe mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I\nsuffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention\nengaged.\nNeither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That was\nmade apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our\nagreeing\u2014without agreement\u2014to make my recovery of the use of my hands a\nquestion of so many hours, not of so many weeks.",

As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect\nconfidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the\nday was wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more\nby the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it\nspontaneously.\n\"I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.\"\n\"Where was Clara?\"\n\"Dear little thing!\" said Herbert. \"She was up and down with\nGruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floor\nthe moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.\nWhat with rum and pepper,\u2014and pepper and rum,\u2014I should think his\npegging must be nearly over.\"\n\"And then you will be married, Herbert?\"\n\"How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?\u2014Lay your arm out upon\nthe back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I'll sit down here, and get the\nbandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was\nspeaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?\"\n\"I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.\"\n\"So you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, and\ntold me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about some\nwoman that he had had great trouble with.\u2014Did I hurt you?\"\nI had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.\n\"I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.\"\n\"Well! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.\nShall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?\"\n\"Tell me by all means. Every word.\"\nHerbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been\nrather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for.\n\"Your head is cool?\" he said, touching it.\n\"Quite,\" said I. \"Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.\"\n\"It seems,\" said Herbert, \"\u2014there's a bandage off most charmingly, and\nnow comes the cool one,\u2014makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,\ndon't it? but it will be comfortable presently,\u2014it seems that the woman\nwas a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;\nrevengeful, Handel, to the last degree.\"\n\"To what last degree?\"\n\"Murder.\u2014Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?\"\n\"I don't feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?\"\n\"Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,\" said\nHerbert, \"but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended her, and\nthe reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis. It\nwas another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had been\na struggle\u2014in a barn. Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair,\nmay be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for the\nvictim was found throttled.\"\n\"Was the woman brought in guilty?\"\n\"No; she was acquitted.\u2014My poor Handel, I hurt you!\"\n\"It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?\"\n\"This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little\nchild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the\nyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore\nthat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he\nshould never see it again; then she vanished.\u2014There's the worst arm\ncomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right\nhand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light than\nby a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don't see the poor\nblistered patches too distinctly.\u2014You don't think your breathing is\naffected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.\"\n\"Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?\"\n\"There comes the darkest part of Provis's life. She did.\"\n\"That is, he says she did.\"\n\"Why, of course, my dear boy,\" returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,\nand again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. \"He says it all.\nI have no other information.\"\n\"No, to be sure.\"\n\"Now, whether,\" pursued Herbert, \"he had used the child's mother ill,\nor whether he had used the child's mother well, Provis doesn't say; but\nshe had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he\ndescribed to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for\nher, and forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be\ncalled upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause\nof her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept\nhimself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was\nonly vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the\njealousy arose. After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost\nthe child and the child's mother.\"",

Mr. Jaggers's eyes retired a little deeper into his head when\nI handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,\nwith instructions to draw the check for his signature.

Put\nthe case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\neccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.\"\n\"I follow you, sir.\"\n\"Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he\nsaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\ndestruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\na criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that\nhe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,\nneglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing\nup to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\nin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,\nto develop into the fish that were to come to his net,\u2014to be\nprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.\"\n\"I follow you, sir.\"\n\"Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the\nheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make\nno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this\npower: \"I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so,\nyou did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you\nthrough it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it\nshould be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be\nproduced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring\nyou off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,\nyour child is still saved.\" Put the case that this was done, and that\nthe woman was cleared.\"\n\"I understand you perfectly.\"\n\"But that I make no admissions?\"\n\"That you make no admissions.\" And Wemmick repeated, \"No admissions.\"\n\"Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little\nshaken the woman's intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,\nshe was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be\nsheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the\nold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\nout, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend\nthe imaginary case?\"\n\"Quite.\"\n\"Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That\nthe mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the\nmother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\nmiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was\nstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case\nto yourself very carefully.\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.\"\nAnd Wemmick said, \"I do.\"\n\"For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father's? I think\nhe would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother's? I\nthink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For\nthe daughter's? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her\nparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to\ndisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for\nlife. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her\nthe subject of those 'poor dreams' which have, at one time or another,\nbeen in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you\nthat you had better\u2014and would much sooner when you had thought well of\nit\u2014chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right\nhand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut _that_ off\ntoo.\"",

Take Startop. A\ngood fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and\nhonourable.\"\nI had thought of him more than once.\n\"But how much would you tell him, Herbert?\"\n\"It is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere\nfreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know\nthat there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.\nYou go with him?\"\n\"No doubt.\"\n\"Where?\"\nIt had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the\npoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,\u2014Hamburg, Rotterdam,\nAntwerp,\u2014the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I\nhad always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\nboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\nleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\ndown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\nuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\nlay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\nmade inquiries beforehand.\nHerbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\nHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\nsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\nourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separated\nfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\nHerbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\nwithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o'clock reported it\ndone. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\nStartop, and he was more than ready to join.\nThose two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;\nour charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our\nobject, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not\ncome home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that\nhe should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he\nshould prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on\nWednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the\narrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that\nhe should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on\nboard.",

Seeing\nhim, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes\nupon him.\nHe lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,\nand dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away\nfrom him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms\nfolded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to\na stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,\u2014a fixture\nthere,\u2014the means of ascent to the loft above.\n\"Now,\" said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, \"I've\ngot you.\"\n\"Unbind me. Let me go!\"\n\"Ah!\" he returned, \"_I_'ll let you go. I'll let you go to the moon,\nI'll let you go to the stars. All in good time.\"\n\"Why have you lured me here?\"\n\"Don't you know?\" said he, with a deadly look.\n\"Why have you set upon me in the dark?\"\n\"Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than\ntwo. O you enemy, you enemy!\"\nHis enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms\nfolded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a\nmalignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence, he\nput his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a\nbrass-bound stock.\n\"Do you know this?\" said he, making as if he would take aim at me. \"Do\nyou know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!\"\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n[Illustration]\n\"You cost me that place. You did. Speak!\"\n\"What else could I do?\"\n\"You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to\ncome betwixt me and a young woman I liked?\"\n\"When did I?\"\n\"When didn't you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to\nher.\"\n\"You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done\nyou no harm, if you had done yourself none.\"\n\"You're a liar. And you'll take any pains, and spend any money, to\ndrive me out of this country, will you?\" said he, repeating my words to\nBiddy in the last interview I had with her. \"Now, I'll tell you a piece\nof information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of\nthis country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty\ntimes told, to the last brass farden!\" As he shook his heavy hand at\nme, with his mouth snarling like a tiger's, I felt that it was true.\n\"What are you going to do to me?\"\n\"I'm a-going,\" said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a\nheavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,\u2014\"I'm\na-going to have your life!\"\nHe leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it\nacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.\n\"You was always in Old Orlick's way since ever you was a child. You\ngoes out of his way this present night. He'll have no more on you.\nYou're dead.\"\nI felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked\nwildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.\n\"More than that,\" said he, folding his arms on the table again, \"I\nwon't have a rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth.\nI'll put your body in the kiln,\u2014I'd carry two such to it, on my",

My eyes were fixed on the\nladder against the wall, when I came to myself,\u2014had opened on it before\nmy mind saw it,\u2014and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\nwas in the place where I had lost it.\nToo indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who\nsupported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came\nbetween me and it a face. The face of Trabb's boy!\n\"I think he's all right!\" said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice; \"but\nain't he just pale though!\"\nAt these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\nand I saw my supporter to be\u2014\n\"Herbert! Great Heaven!\"\n\"Softly,\" said Herbert. \"Gently, Handel. Don't be too eager.\"\n\"And our old comrade, Startop!\" I cried, as he too bent over me.\n\"Remember what he is going to assist us in,\" said Herbert, \"and be\ncalm.\"\nThe allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in\nmy arm. \"The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\nto-night? How long have I been here?\" For, I had a strange and strong\nmisgiving that I had been lying there a long time\u2014a day and a\nnight,\u2014two days and nights,\u2014more.\n\"The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.\"\n\"Thank God!\"\n\"And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,\" said Herbert. \"But\nyou can't help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can\nyou stand?\"\n\"Yes, yes,\" said I, \"I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\narm.\"\nThey laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen\nand inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they\ntore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully\nreplaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain\nsome cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the\ndoor of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the\nquarry on our way back. Trabb's boy\u2014Trabb's overgrown young man\nnow\u2014went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come\nin at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I\nhad last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.\nThe white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as\nI had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.\nEntreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,\u2014which at\nfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\nquiet,\u2014I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\nchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\nmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was\ngone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\nhour's consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\nvolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.\nFinding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\nresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\nBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\nfinding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's, where they lost me.\nHereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\nI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.\nAmong the loungers under the Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's\nBoy,\u2014true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he\nhad no business,\u2014and Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss\nHavisham's in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's boy became\ntheir guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by\nthe town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went\nalong, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought\nthere on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's\nsafety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be\nmischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and\nwent on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,\nendeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could\nhear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was\nwhile my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I\nwas there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,\nand rushed in, closely followed by the other two.\nWhen I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our\nimmediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it\nwas, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such\na course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be\nfatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\npresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\nlight of the matter to Trabb's boy; who, I am convinced, would have\nbeen much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his\nintervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb's boy was of a\nmalignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it\nwas in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's\nexpense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed\nto meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an\nill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).",

By that time the river had lifted us a\nlittle, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on\nthe low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into\nblack; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were\nthe rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,\nsave here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.\nAs the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,\nwould not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for\nclearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could\nfind. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for\nanything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or\nfive dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with\nher galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.\nThe night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and\nwhat light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as\nthe oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.\nAt this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we\nwere followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular\nintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or\nother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and\nthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\ncreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them\nnervously. Sometimes, \"What was that ripple?\" one of us would say in a\nlow voice. Or another, \"Is that a boat yonder?\" And afterwards we would\nfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with\nwhat an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.\nAt length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran\nalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard\nby. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light\nto be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I\ndare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good\nfire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various\nliquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,\u2014\"such as\nthey were,\" the landlord said. No other company was in the house than\nthe landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the \"Jack\" of the\nlittle causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been\nlow-water mark too.\nWith this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came\nashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all\nelse, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the\nkitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop\nwere to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as\ncarefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there\nwere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have\nthought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,\nnotwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.",

      "text": "time it wanted but ten minutes of one o'clock, and we began to look out\nfor her smoke.\nBut, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards\nwe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on\nat full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of\nsaying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands\ncordially, and neither Herbert's eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I\nsaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\nahead of us, and row out into the same track.\nA stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer's smoke,\nby reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,\ncoming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the\ntide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to\nsit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, \"Trust to\nme, dear boy,\" and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was\nvery skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and\nfallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,\nshe kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or\ntwo when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and\nlooked at us attentively,\u2014as did all the rowers; the other sitter was\nwrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some\ninstruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in\neither boat.\nStartop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\nand gave me the word \"Hamburg,\" in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\nShe was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew\nlouder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,\nwhen the galley hailed us. I answered.\n\"You have a returned Transport there,\" said the man who held the lines.\n\"That's the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\notherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\nand you to assist.\"\nAt the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\nhe ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke\nahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on\nto our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\nconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\nheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but\nfelt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw\nthe steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner's shoulder,\nand saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,\nand saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\nfrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,\nlean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\nshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that\nthe face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.\nStill, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white\nterror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board\nthe steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink\nfrom under me.\nIt was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\nmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\ntaken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;\nbut our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.\nWhat with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of\nher steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first\ndistinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the\ngalley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong\nstrokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and\neagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,\nbearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up\nhis hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and\ntrue before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,\nbut not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled\nat the wrists and ankles.\nThe galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water\nwas resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not\nunderstanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had\nbeen hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and\nwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out\nwas kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were\ngone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.\nAt length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern\nwe had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.\nHere I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,\u2014Provis no\nlonger,\u2014who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and a\ndeep cut in the head.\nHe told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the\nsteamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to\nhis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought\nhe had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did\nnot pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,\nbut that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify\nhim, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had\nboth gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him\n(Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him\nin it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down\nfiercely locked in each other's arms, and that there had been a\nstruggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,\nand swum away.\nI never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told\nme. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their\ngoing overboard.\nWhen I asked this officer's permission to change the prisoner's wet\nclothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the\npublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take\ncharge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book\nwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer's. He further\ngave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to\naccord that grace to my two friends.\nThe Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\ndown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\nlikeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to\nbe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\nvarious stages of decay.\nWe remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then\nMagwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and\nStartop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a\ndoleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch's side, I felt\nthat that was my place henceforth while he lived.",

Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had\nmeant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened\nthat there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could\ngive the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his\nprivate house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and\nMr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing. It was the\nsole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five\nminutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could\nprevent its going against us.\nI imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\nfate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\nhaving \"let it slip through my fingers,\" and said we must memorialise\nby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal\nfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which the\nforfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this\ncase to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not\nrelated to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;\nhe had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his\napprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I\nfinally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my\nheart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to\nestablish one.\nThere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had\nhoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some\naccurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs. When his body was found, many\nmiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he\nwas only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still\nlegible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a\nbanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\ninformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\nJaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His\nignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but\nthat my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.\nAfter three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over\nfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness\ncame, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial\nat the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.",

The blessed\ndarling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the\nred book, and hasn't a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for\nthe son of my mother!\"\nOn the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,\u2014full of\nbright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,\u2014as he sat on one of the\nseaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note\nto Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and\nover again, and then went to my lonely home,\u2014if it deserved the name;\nfor it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.\nOn the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an\nunsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had\ncome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of\nexplanation in reference to that failure.\n\"The late Compeyson,\" said Wemmick, \"had by little and little got at\nthe bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was\nfrom the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people\nbeing always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,\nseeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I\nthought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only\nsuppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,\nhabitually to deceive his own instruments. You don't blame me, I hope,\nMr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.\"\n\"I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most\nearnestly for all your interest and friendship.\"\n\"Thank you, thank you very much. It's a bad job,\" said Wemmick,\nscratching his head, \"and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a\nlong time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable\nproperty. Dear me!\"\n\"What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.\"\n\"Yes, to be sure,\" said Wemmick. \"Of course, there can be no objection\nto your being sorry for him, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself\nto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and\nbeing so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have\nbeen saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been\nsaved. That's the difference between the property and the owner, don't\nyou see?\"\nI invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of\ngrog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\nwas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up\nto it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,\u2014\n\"What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?\"\n\"Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.\"\n\"These twelve years, more likely,\" said Wemmick. \"Yes. I'm going to\ntake a holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk. More than\nthat; I'm going to ask you to take a walk with me.\"\nI was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,\nwhen Wemmick anticipated me.\n\"I know your engagements,\" said he, \"and I know you are out of sorts,\nMr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\nIt ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy you\n(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn't you\nstretch a point and manage it?\"\nHe had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\nto do for him. I said I could manage it,\u2014would manage it,\u2014and he was so\nvery much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\nparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\npast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.",

      "text": "Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday\nmorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking\ntighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two\nglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have\nbeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his\nbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\nWhen we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and\nwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was\nconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it\nover his shoulder. \"Why, we are not going fishing!\" said I. \"No,\"\nreturned Wemmick, \"but I like to walk with one.\"\nI thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went\ntowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said\nsuddenly,\u2014\n\"Halloa! Here's a church!\"\nThere was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\nsurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,\u2014\n\"Let's go in!\"\nWe went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked\nall round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,\nand getting something out of paper there.\n\"Halloa!\" said he. \"Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 'em\non!\"\nAs the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\nto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\nwere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\ndoor, escorting a lady.\n\"Halloa!\" said Wemmick. \"Here's Miss Skiffins! Let's have a wedding.\"\nThat discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\nAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the\naltar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to\nput him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\npillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\ngentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\nresistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\nperfection.\nThe clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\nthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\npreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out\nof his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, \"Halloa! Here's a\nring!\"\nI acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;\nwhile a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a\nfeint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of\ngiving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the\nclergyman's being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.\nWhen he said, \"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?\" the\nold gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we\nhad arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.\nUpon which, the clergyman said again, \"WHO giveth this woman to be\nmarried to this man?\" The old gentleman being still in a state of most\nestimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed\nvoice, \"Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?\" To which the Aged replied\nwith great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, \"All right, John,\nall right, my boy!\" And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon\nit, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely\nmarried that day.\nIt was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\nWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,\nand put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,\nput her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. \"_Now_, Mr.\nPip,\" said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\nout, \"let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\nwedding-party!\"\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\nboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\nthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\nunwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in\na high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,\nand submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have\ndone.\nWe had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\ntable, Wemmick said, \"Provided by contract, you know; don't be afraid\nof it!\" I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the\nCastle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I\ncould.\nWemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with\nhim, and wished him joy.\n\"Thankee!\" said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. \"She's such a manager of\nfowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\nyourself. I say, Mr. Pip!\" calling me back, and speaking low. \"This is\naltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.\"\n\"I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,\" said I.\nWemmick nodded. \"After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may\nas well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or\nsomething of the kind.\"",

He had broken\ntwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great\npain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\nvery little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the\nfirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he\nought to hear.\nBeing far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after\nthe first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of\nbeing with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for his\nillness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\ndetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\nAlthough I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\ndo not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\nwasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\nwhen the prison door closed upon him.\nThe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\nwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\ncircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\nway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\nIt happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his\ndesperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in\nattendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his\neyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had\nseen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was\na little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I\nnever knew him complain.",

It\nwas obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,\nand was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the\nbar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting\nclose to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he\nstretched forth to me.\nThe trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said\nfor him were said,\u2014how he had taken to industrious habits, and had\nthriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that\nhe had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It\nwas impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him\nguilty.\nAt that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible\nexperience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing\nof Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of\nDeath. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds\nbefore me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that\nI saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\nsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him.\nThe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,\ndown to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering\nin the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside\nit at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and\nwomen; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\nweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\nstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\nand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\ngallery full of people,\u2014a large theatrical audience,\u2014looked on, as the\ntwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\naddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\nbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments\nand punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of\nyears; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had\nmade his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable\nman would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when\nfar removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a\npeaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those\npropensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered\nhim a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and\nrepentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.\nBeing here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading\nthe officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of\nflight, he had resisted them, and had\u2014he best knew whether by express\ndesign, or in the blindness of his hardihood\u2014caused the death of his\ndenouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment\nfor his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his\ncase being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\nThe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\nlight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\nwith absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all\nthings, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face\nin this way of light, the prisoner said, \"My Lord, I have received my\nsentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,\" and sat down\nagain. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had\nto say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of",

Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an\nintention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I\nsat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,\nthat I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the\nsingleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There\nwas duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer\nalways gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick\nprisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as\nsick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be\nthanked!) always joined in the same report.\nAs the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\nlooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\nsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\nunderstand his meaning very well.\nThe number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in\nhim than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and\nlighted up as I entered.\n\"Dear boy,\" he said, as I sat down by his bed: \"I thought you was late.\nBut I knowed you couldn't be that.\"\n\"It is just the time,\" said I. \"I waited for it at the gate.\"\n\"You always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?\"\n\"Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.\"\n\"Thank'ee dear boy, thank'ee. God bless you! You've never deserted me,\ndear boy.\"\nI pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once\nmeant to desert him.\n\"And what's the best of all,\" he said, \"you've been more comfortable\nalonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.\nThat's best of all.\"\nHe lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,\nand love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and\na film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.\n\"Are you in much pain to-day?\"\n\"I don't complain of none, dear boy.\"\n\"You never do complain.\"\nHe had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to\nmean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid\nit there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.\nThe allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,\n\"You needn't go yet.\" I thanked him gratefully, and asked, \"Might I\nspeak to him, if he can hear me?\"\nThe governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\nthough it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid\nlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.\n\"Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I\nsay?\"\nA gentle pressure on my hand.\n\"You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.\"\nA stronger pressure on my hand.\n\"She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a\nlady and very beautiful. And I love her!\"\nWith a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my\nyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying\non it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,\nand his head dropped quietly on his breast.\nMindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men\nwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better\nwords that I could say beside his bed, than \"O Lord, be merciful to him\na sinner!\"",

At once I put bills\nup in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and\nbegan to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought\nrather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and\nconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth\nbeyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me\nhad enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that\nit was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even\ncareless as to that.\nFor a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,\u2014anywhere,\naccording as I happened to sink down,\u2014with a heavy head and aching\nlimbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which\nappeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;\nand when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I\nfound I could not do so.\nWhether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the\nnight, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether\nI had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great\nterror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found\nmyself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up\nthe stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been\ninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and\ngroaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my\nown making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark\ncorner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again,\nthat Miss Havisham was consuming within it,\u2014these were things that I\ntried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that\nmorning on my bed. But the vapour of a limekiln would come between me\nand them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapour at last\nthat I saw two men looking at me.\n\"What do you want?\" I asked, starting; \"I don't know you.\"\n\"Well, sir,\" returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the\nshoulder, \"this is a matter that you'll soon arrange, I dare say, but\nyou're arrested.\"\n\"What is the debt?\"\n\"Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller's account, I\nthink.\"\n\"What is to be done?\"\n\"You had better come to my house,\" said the man. \"I keep a very nice\nhouse.\"\nI made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended to\nthem, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I\nstill lay there.\n\"You see my state,\" said I. \"I would come with you if I could; but\nindeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die\nby the way.\"\nPerhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to\nbelieve that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in my\nmemory by only this one slender thread, I don't know what they did,\nexcept that they forbore to remove me.\nThat I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I\noften lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I\nconfounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a\nbrick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the\ngiddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a\nvast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored\nin my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered\noff; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own\nremembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes\nstruggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and\nthat I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and\nwould then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me\ndown, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a\nconstant tendency in all these people,\u2014who, when I was very ill, would",

Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I\nopened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the\nbedside, Joe.

But I interrupt you in what you\nsaid to Biddy.\"\n\"Which it were,\" said Joe, \"that how you might be amongst strangers,\nand that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a\nmoment might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, 'Go\nto him, without loss of time.' That,\" said Joe, summing up with his\njudicial air, \"were the word of Biddy. 'Go to him,' Biddy say, 'without\nloss of time.' In short, I shouldn't greatly deceive you,\" Joe added,\nafter a little grave reflection, \"if I represented to you that the word\nof that young woman were, 'without a minute's loss of time.'\"\nThere Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to\nin great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at\nstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that\nI was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay\nquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in\nit.\nEvidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at\nhim, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the\npride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its\ncurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as\nthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the\nroom kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own\nwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,\nJoe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the\npen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his\nsleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was\nnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,\nand to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;\nand when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\nhave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen\nspluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on\nthe side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into\nspace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was\ntripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he\ngot on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had\nremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\nhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the\neffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,\nwith unbounded satisfaction.\nNot to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to\ntalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He\nshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.\n\"Is she dead, Joe?\"\n\"Why you see, old chap,\" said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by\nway of getting at it by degrees, \"I wouldn't go so far as to say that,\nfor that's a deal to say; but she ain't\u2014\"\n\"Living, Joe?\"\n\"That's nigher where it is,\" said Joe; \"she ain't living.\"\n\"Did she linger long, Joe?\"\n\"Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you\nwas put to it) a week,\" said Joe; still determined, on my account, to\ncome at everything by degrees.\n\"Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?\"\n\"Well, old chap,\" said Joe, \"it do appear that she had settled the most\nof it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had\nwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the\naccident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,\ndo you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand\nunto him? 'Because of Pip's account of him, the said Matthew.'

      "text": "This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I\nhad done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other\nrelations had any legacies?\n\"Miss Sarah,\" said Joe, \"she have twenty-five pound perannium fur to\nbuy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty\npound down. Mrs.\u2014what's the name of them wild beasts with humps, old\nchap?\"\n\"Camels?\" said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.\nJoe nodded. \"Mrs. Camels,\" by which I presently understood he meant\nCamilla, \"she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in\nspirits when she wake up in the night.\"\nThe accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give\nme great confidence in Joe's information. \"And now,\" said Joe, \"you\nain't that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one\nadditional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he's been a bustin' open a\ndwelling-ouse.\"\n\"Whose?\" said I.\n\"Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,\" said\nJoe, apologetically; \"still, a Englishman's ouse is his Castle, and\ncastles must not be busted 'cept when done in war time. And wotsume'er\nthe failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.\"\n\"Is it Pumblechook's house that has been broken into, then?\"\n\"That's it, Pip,\" said Joe; \"and they took his till, and they took his\ncash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,\nand they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him\nup to his bedpust, and they giv' him a dozen, and they stuffed his\nmouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he\nknowed Orlick, and Orlick's in the county jail.\"\nBy these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow\nto gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe\nstayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.\nFor the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,\nthat I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in\nthe old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old\nunassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my\nlife since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles\nof the fever that was gone. He did everything for me except the\nhousehold work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, after\npaying off the laundress on his first arrival. \"Which I do assure you,\nPip,\" he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; \"I found her\na tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the\nfeathers in a bucket, for sale. Which she would have tapped yourn next,\nand draw'd it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away\nthe coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the\nwine and spirits in your Wellington boots.\"\nWe looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had\nonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day\ncame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,\ntook me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were\nstill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\nthe wealth of his great nature.\nAnd Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,\nwhere the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,\nand sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be\nSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how\nit had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been\nforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and\nby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning\nand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\nthere came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday\nbells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I\nfelt that I was not nearly thankful enough,\u2014that I was too weak yet to\nbe even that,\u2014and I laid my head on Joe's shoulder, as I had laid it\nlong ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too\nmuch for my young senses.\nMore composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to\ntalk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change\nwhatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my\neyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.\nWhen we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me\u2014so\neasily!\u2014across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful\nChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet\nmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of\nmy late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself\nnow, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself\nwhether I ought to refer to it when he did not.\n\"Have you heard, Joe,\" I asked him that evening, upon further\nconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, \"who my patron\nwas?\"\n\"I heerd,\" returned Joe, \"as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.\"\n\"Did you hear who it was, Joe?\"\n\"Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv' you\nthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.\"\n\"So it was.\"\n\"Astonishing!\" said Joe, in the placidest way.\n\"Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?\" I presently asked, with\nincreasing diffidence.\n\"Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"I think,\" said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather\nevasively at the window-seat, \"as I _did_ hear tell that how he were\nsomething or another in a general way in that direction.\"\n\"Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?\"\n\"Not partickler, Pip.\"\n\"If you would like to hear, Joe\u2014\" I was beginning, when Joe got up and\ncame to my sofa.\n\"Lookee here, old chap,\" said Joe, bending over me. \"Ever the best of\nfriends; ain't us, Pip?\"\nI was ashamed to answer him.\n\"Wery good, then,\" said Joe, as if I _had_ answered; \"that's all right;\nthat's agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as\nbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There's subjects enough\nas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your\npoor sister and her Rampages! And don't you remember Tickler?\"\n\"I do indeed, Joe.\"\n\"Lookee here, old chap,\" said Joe. \"I done what I could to keep you and\nTickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my\ninclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it\nwere not so much,\" said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, \"that\nshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that\nshe dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain't a\ngrab at a man's whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your\nsister was quite welcome), that 'ud put a man off from getting a little\nchild out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into\nheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up\nand says to himself, 'Where is the good as you are a-doing? I grant you\nI see the 'arm,' says the man, 'but I don't see the good. I call upon\nyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.'\"\n\"The man says?\" I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\n\"The man says,\" Joe assented. \"Is he right, that man?\"\n\"Dear Joe, he is always right.\"\n\"Well, old chap,\" said Joe, \"then abide by your words. If he's always\nright (which in general he's more likely wrong), he's right when he\nsays this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when\nyou was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know'd as J.\nGargery's power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal\nto his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two\nsech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy\ngiv' herself a deal o' trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost\nawful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this\nlight, as I should so put it. Both of which,\" said Joe, quite charmed\nwith his logical arrangement, \"being done, now this to you a true\nfriend, say. Namely. You mustn't go a overdoing on it, but you must\nhave your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt\nthe sheets.\"\nThe delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact\nand kindness with which Biddy\u2014who with her woman's wit had found me out\nso soon\u2014had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\nwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all\ndissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\nunderstand.\nAnother thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\ndevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\nof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\neasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\nfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\nthe dear \"old Pip, old chap,\" that now were music in my ears. I too had\nfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\nimperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe's hold upon them began\nto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\nall mine.\nAh! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\nin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\nJoe's innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\nstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\nloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?\nIt was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\nTemple Gardens leaning on Joe's arm, that I saw this change in him very\nplainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at\nthe river, and I chanced to say as we got up,\u2014\n\"See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back\nby myself.\"\n\"Which do not overdo it, Pip,\" said Joe; \"but I shall be happy fur to\nsee you able, sir.\"\nThe last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\nfurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker\nthan I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\nthoughtful.\nI, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\nchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\ndown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\nquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\nsavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\nmust not suffer him to do it.\nIt was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\nbed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,\u2014to-morrow being\nSunday,\u2014and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\nmorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\nlast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\n(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\nout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\ncleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\narrived at a resolution too.\nWe had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\nthen walked in the fields.\n\"I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,\" I said.\n\"Dear old Pip, old chap, you're a'most come round, sir.\"\n\"It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.\"\n\"Likeways for myself, sir,\" Joe returned.\n\"We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\ndays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\nforget these.\"\n\"Pip,\" said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, \"there has\nbeen larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us\u2014have been.\"\nAt night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done\nall through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well\nas in the morning?\n\"Yes, dear Joe, quite.\"\n\"And are always a getting stronger, old chap?\"\n\"Yes, dear Joe, steadily.\"\nJoe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and\nsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, \"Good night!\"\nWhen I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of\nmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before\nbreakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;\nfor, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and\nhe was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.\nI hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These\nwere its brief contents:\u2014\n\"Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear\nPip and will do better without\nJO.\n\"P.S. Ever the best of friends.\"\nEnclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I\nhad been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my\ncreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be\nquite recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe's having paid the money;\nbut Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.",

No. You needn't bring any, William.\"\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand\nover me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\n\"Little more than skin and bone!\" mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. \"And\nyet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread\nafore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!\"\nThis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, \"May I?\"\nand the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\nsame fat five fingers.\n\"Hah!\" he went on, handing me the bread and butter. \"And air you\na-going to Joseph?\"\n\"In heaven's name,\" said I, firing in spite of myself, \"what does it\nmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.\"\nIt was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\nthe opportunity he wanted.\n\"Yes, young man,\" said he, releasing the handle of the article in\nquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, \"I _will_ leave that\nteapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I\nforgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to\nwish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of\nprodigygality, to be stimilated by the 'olesome nourishment of your\nforefathers. And yet,\" said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and\nwaiter, and pointing me out at arm's length, \"this is him as I ever\nsported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I\ntell you this is him!\"\nA low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\nparticularly affected.\n\"This is him,\" said Pumblechook, \"as I have rode in my shay-cart. This\nis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\nof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M'ria from\nher own mother, let him deny it if he can!\"\nThe waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\nthe case a black look.\n\"Young man,\" said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\nfashion, \"you air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask\nme, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to\nJoseph.\"\nThe waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\n\"Now,\" said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of\nsaying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\nconclusive, \"I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\nthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is\nWilliam, which his father's name was Potkins if I do not deceive\nmyself.\"\n\"You do not, sir,\" said William.\n\"In their presence,\" pursued Pumblechook, \"I will tell you, young man,\nwhat to say to Joseph. Says you, \"Joseph, I have this day seen my\nearliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun's. I will name no\nnames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\nseen that man.\"\n\"I swear I don't see him here,\" said I.\n\"Say that likewise,\" retorted Pumblechook. \"Say you said that, and even\nJoseph will probably betray surprise.\"\n\"There you quite mistake him,\" said I. \"I know better.\"\n\"Says you,\" Pumblechook went on, \"'Joseph, I have seen that man, and\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\ncharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\nignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\ngratitoode. Yes, Joseph,' says you,\" here Pumblechook shook his head\nand hand at me, \"'he knows my total deficiency of common human\ngratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,\nJoseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.'\"\nWindy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\nto talk thus to mine.\n\"Says you, 'Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\nrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\nProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\nplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode to\nhis earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's_. But that man said he\ndid not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to\ndo it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would\ndo it again.'\"\n\"It's pity,\" said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted\nbreakfast, \"that the man did not say what he had done and would do\nagain.\"\n\"Squires of the Boar!\" Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,\n\"and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town\nor down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do\nit, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.\"\nWith those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\nand left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by",

      "text": "But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose\ngreat forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,\ncontrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for\nmy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew\nnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness\nfurther and further behind.\nThe June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were\nsoaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more\nbeautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many\npleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the\nchange for the better that would come over my character when I had a\nguiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I\nhad proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for\nmy heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass,\nthat I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,\nand whose wanderings had lasted many years.\nThe schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the\nlittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness'\nsake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a\nholiday; no children were there, and Biddy's house was closed. Some\nhopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties,\nbefore she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.\nBut the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it\nunder the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer.\nLong after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I\nheard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there,\nand the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and\ntheir leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the\nclink of Joe's hammer was not in the midsummer wind.\nAlmost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I\nsaw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no\nglittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and\nstill.\nBut the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to be in\nuse, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the\nwindow was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning\nto peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in\narm.\nAt first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but\nin another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she\nwept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she,\nbecause I looked so worn and white.\n\"But dear Biddy, how smart you are!\"\n\"Yes, dear Pip.\"\n\"And Joe, how smart _you_ are!\"\n\"Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.\"\nI looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then\u2014\n\"It's my wedding-day!\" cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, \"and I am\nmarried to Joe!\"\nThey had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the\nold deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe's\nrestoring touch was on my shoulder. \"Which he warn't strong enough, my\ndear, fur to be surprised,\" said Joe. And Biddy said, \"I ought to have\nthought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.\" They were both so\noverjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to\nthem, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their\nday complete!\nMy first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never\nbreathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me\nin my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been\nhis knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!\n\"Dear Biddy,\" said I, \"you have the best husband in the whole world,\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would have\u2014But no, you\ncouldn't love him better than you do.\"\n\"No, I couldn't indeed,\" said Biddy.\n\"And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble\nJoe!\"\nJoe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before\nhis eyes.\n\"And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in\ncharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you\nhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I\nam going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I\nshall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have\nkept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don't think, dear Joe\nand Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I\ncould cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if\nI could!\"\nThey were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no\nmore.\n\"But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter\nnight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\never. Don't tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell him, Biddy,\nthat I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured you\nboth, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child,\nI said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I\ndid.\"\n\"I ain't a-going,\" said Joe, from behind his sleeve, \"to tell him\nnothink o' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't.\"\n\"And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind\nhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you\nsay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and\nthen I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better\nof me, in the time to come!\"\n\"O dear old Pip, old chap,\" said Joe. \"God knows as I forgive you, if I\nhave anythink to forgive!\"\n\"Amen! And God knows I do!\" echoed Biddy.\n\"Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few\nminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go\nwith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say\ngood-bye!\"\nI sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition\nwith my creditors,\u2014who gave me ample time to pay them in full,\u2014and I\nwent out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England, and\nwithin two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four\nmonths I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across\nthe parlour ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under\nold Bill Barley's growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to\nmarry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until\nhe brought her back.\nMany a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived\nhappily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my\ndebts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It\nwas not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to\nHerbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert's partnership\nhad been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he\ntold it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow\nand I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not\nleave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we\nmade mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had\na good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so\nmuch to Herbert's ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often\nwondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I\nwas one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude",

I touched it\nso softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking\nhis pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as\nstrong as ever, though a little grey, sat Joe; and there, fenced into\nthe corner with Joe's leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking\nat the fire, was\u2014I again!\n\"We giv' him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,\" said Joe,\ndelighted, when I took another stool by the child's side (but I did\n_not_ rumple his hair), \"and we hoped he might grow a little bit like\nyou, and we think he do.\"\nI thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we\ntalked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took\nhim down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,\nand he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the\nmemory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife\nof the Above.\n\"Biddy,\" said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little\ngirl lay sleeping in her lap, \"you must give Pip to me one of these\ndays; or lend him, at all events.\"\n\"No, no,\" said Biddy, gently. \"You must marry.\"\n\"So Herbert and Clara say, but I don't think I shall, Biddy.

      "text": "A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet\nup to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the\nmoon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where\nevery part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,\nand where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was\nlooking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure\nin it.\nThe figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving\ntowards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the\nfigure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away,\nwhen it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if\nmuch surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,\u2014\n\"Estella!\"\n\"I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.\"\nThe freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable\nmajesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,\nI had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,\nsoftened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was\nthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand.\nWe sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, \"After so many years,\nit is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our\nfirst meeting was! Do you often come back?\"\n\"I have never been here since.\"\n\"Nor I.\"\nThe moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white\nceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought\nof the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had\nheard on earth.\nEstella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.\n\"I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been\nprevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!\"\nThe silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and\nthe same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing\nthat I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she\nsaid quietly,\u2014\n\"Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in\nthis condition?\"\n\"Yes, Estella.\"\n\"The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not\nrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I\nhave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I\nmade in all the wretched years.\"\n\"Is it to be built on?\"\n\"At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And\nyou,\" she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,\u2014\"you\nlive abroad still?\"\n\"Still.\"\n\"And do well, I am sure?\"\n\"I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore\u2014yes, I do\nwell.\"\n\"I have often thought of you,\" said Estella.\n\"Have you?\"\n\"Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from\nme the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant\nof its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the\nadmission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.\"\n\"You have always held your place in my heart,\" I answered.\nAnd we were silent again until she spoke.\n\"I little thought,\" said Estella, \"that I should take leave of you in\ntaking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.\"\n\"Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,\nthe remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and\npainful.\"\n\"But you said to me,\" returned Estella, very earnestly, \"'God bless\nyou, God forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will\nnot hesitate to say that to me now,\u2014now, when suffering has been\nstronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what\nyour heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but\u2014I hope\u2014into a\nbetter shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me\nwe are friends.\"\n\"We are friends,\" said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from\nthe bench.\n\"And will continue friends apart,\" said Estella.\nI took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as\nthe morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so\nthe evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of\ntranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting\nfrom her.",
