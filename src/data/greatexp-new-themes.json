You know what a file is?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"And you know what wittles is?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger.\n\"You get me a file.\" He tilted me again. \"And you get me wittles.\" He\ntilted me again. \"You bring 'em both to me.\" He tilted me again. \"Or\nI'll have your heart and liver out.\" He tilted me again.\nI was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\nhands, and said, \"If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\nsir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.\"\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\nover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\nposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:\u2014\n\"You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\nbring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and\nyou never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your\nhaving seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall\nbe let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no\nmatter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore\nout, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am.\nThere's a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I\nam a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has\na secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his\nheart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide\nhimself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in\nbed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think\nhimself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and\ncreep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young man\nfrom harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I\nfind it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what\ndo you say?\"\nI said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\nbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\nthe morning.",

It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap\nfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.\nAnd it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our\nalready-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his\ngood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare\nthe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each\nother's admiration now and then,\u2014which stimulated us to new exertions.\nTo-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast\ndiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he\nfound me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my\nuntouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately\nconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had\nbest be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\ncircumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at\nme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.\nJoe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss\nof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he\ndidn't seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than\nusual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like\na pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on\none side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw\nthat my bread and butter was gone.\nThe wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of\nhis bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister's\nobservation.\n\"What's the matter _now_?\" said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.\n\"I say, you know!\" muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious\nremonstrance. \"Pip, old chap! You'll do yourself a mischief. It'll\nstick somewhere. You can't have chawed it, Pip.\"\n\"What's the matter now?\" repeated my sister, more sharply than before.\n\"If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I'd recommend you to do\nit,\" said Joe, all aghast. \"Manners is manners, but still your elth's\nyour elth.\"\nBy this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,\nand, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little\nwhile against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking\nguiltily on.\n\"Now, perhaps you'll mention what's the matter,\" said my sister, out of\nbreath, \"you staring great stuck pig.\"",

I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been\ninclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob\nthe pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no\ngetting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have\nstruck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very\npirate himself rattling his chains.\nAs soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was\nshot with grey, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way,\nand every crack in every board calling after me, \"Stop thief!\" and \"Get\nup, Mrs. Joe!\" In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied\nthan usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare\nhanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back\nwas half turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for\nselection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole\nsome bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I\ntied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night's slice), some\nbrandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had\nsecretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,\nSpanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from\na jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and\na beautiful round compact pork pie. I was nearly going away without the\npie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that\nwas put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,\nand I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not\nintended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.\nThere was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I\nunlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe's tools.\nThen I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which\nI had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the\nmisty marshes.",

I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,\nstooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs\nextraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some\nmiles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.\nAmong this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't\nrobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and\nthe Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to\nspeak (I didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the\nscaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure\ncorners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason\nto be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have\nleft me alone. But they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think\nthe opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,\nevery now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an\nunfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched\nup by these moral goads.\nIt began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\ntheatrical declamation,\u2014as it now appears to me, something like a\nreligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,\u2014and\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\nUpon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\nreproachful voice, \"Do you hear that? Be grateful.\"\n\"Especially,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"be grateful, boy, to them which\nbrought you up by hand.\"\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\npresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, \"Why is it that the\nyoung are never grateful?\" This moral mystery seemed too much for the\ncompany until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, \"Naterally\nwicious.\" Everybody then murmured \"True!\" and looked at me in a\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.",

A bitter sleet came rattling against us\nhere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\nNow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\nthought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\nhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\ncome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\nhad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\nimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\nhunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\ntreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\nIt was of no use asking myself this question now.

I could see none, I\ncould hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by\nhis blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\nstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\nsheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;\nand the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\nthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.",

As we came nearer to the shouting, it became\nmore and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.\nSometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.\nWhen it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate\nthan ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,\nthat we could hear one voice calling \"Murder!\" and another voice,\n\"Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!\" Then\nboth voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would\nbreak out again. And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like\ndeer, and Joe too.\nThe sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and\ntwo of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and\nlevelled when we all ran in.\n\"Here are both men!\" panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a\nditch. \"Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come\nasunder!\"\nWater was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn,\nand blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the\nditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and\nthe other one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and\nstruggling; but of course I knew them both directly.\n\"Mind!\" said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged\nsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: \"_I_ took him! _I_\ngive him up to you! Mind that!\"\n\"It's not much to be particular about,\" said the sergeant; \"it'll do\nyou small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs\nthere!\"\n\"I don't expect it to do me any good. I don't want it to do me more\ngood than it does now,\" said my convict, with a greedy laugh. \"I took\nhim. He knows it. That's enough for me.\"\nThe other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old\nbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.\nHe could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both\nseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\nfalling.\n\"Take notice, guard,\u2014he tried to murder me,\" were his first words.\n\"Tried to murder him?\" said my convict, disdainfully. \"Try, and not do\nit? I took him, and giv' him up; that's what I done. I not only\nprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,\u2014dragged\nhim this far on his way back. He's a gentleman, if you please, this\nvillain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder\nhim? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag\nhim back!\"\nThe other one still gasped, \"He tried\u2014he tried-to\u2014murder me. Bear\u2014bear\nwitness.\"\n\"Lookee here!\" said my convict to the sergeant. \"Single-handed I got\nclear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha' got\nclear of these death-cold flats likewise\u2014look at my leg: you won't find\nmuch iron on it\u2014if I hadn't made the discovery that _he_ was here. Let\n_him_ go free? Let _him_ profit by the means as I found out? Let _him_\nmake a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had\ndied at the bottom there,\" and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch\nwith his manacled hands, \"I'd have held to him with that grip, that you\nshould have been safe to find him in my hold.\"\nThe other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his\ncompanion, repeated, \"He tried to murder me. I should have been a dead\nman if you had not come up.\"",

It had been\nalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards\nvery dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in\na ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches\nkindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the\nopposite bank of the river. \"All right,\" said the sergeant. \"March.\"\nWe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. \"You are expected\non board,\" said the sergeant to my convict; \"they know you are coming.\nDon't straggle, my man.

Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to\nsee it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good\npath now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and\nthere where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy\nsluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming\nin after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon\nthe track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I\ncould see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air\nabout us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather\nto like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We\ncould not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,\nthat two or three times we had to halt while they rested.\nAfter an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut\nand a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,\nand the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was\na smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a\nstand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\novergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a\ndozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in\ntheir great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their\nheads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant\nmade some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the\nconvict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,\nto go on board first.",

But I\nloved Joe,\u2014perhaps for no better reason in those early days than\nbecause the dear fellow let me love him,\u2014and, as to him, my inner self\nwas not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when\nI first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe\nthe whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted\nthat if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing\nJoe's confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at\nnight staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up\nmy tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I\nnever afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair\nwhisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe\nknew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at\nyesterday's meat or pudding when it came on to-day's table, without\nthinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That,\nif Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life\nremarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he\nsuspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word,\nI was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too\ncowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong. I had had no\nintercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of its\nmany inhabitants who act in this manner. Quite an untaught genius, I\nmade the discovery of the line of action for myself.",

      "text": "\"I say, Pip, old chap!\" cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, \"what a\nscholar you are! An't you?\"\n\"I should like to be,\" said I, glancing at the slate as he held it;\nwith a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.\n\"Why, here's a J,\" said Joe, \"and a O equal to anythink! Here's a J and\na O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.\"\n[Illustration]\nI had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this\nmonosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I\naccidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit\nhis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to\nembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I\nshould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, \"Ah! But read the\nrest, Jo.\"\n\"The rest, eh, Pip?\" said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching\neye, \"One, two, three. Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three\nJ-O, Joes in it, Pip!\"\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the\nwhole letter.\n\"Astonishing!\" said Joe, when I had finished. \"You ARE a scholar.\"\n\"How do you spell Gargery, Joe?\" I asked him, with a modest patronage.\n\"I don't spell it at all,\" said Joe.\n\"But supposing you did?\"\n\"It _can't_ be supposed,\" said Joe. \"Tho' I'm uncommon fond of reading,\ntoo.\"\n\"Are you, Joe?\"\n\"On-common. Give me,\" said Joe, \"a good book, or a good newspaper, and\nsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!\" he\ncontinued, after rubbing his knees a little, \"when you _do_ come to a J\nand a O, and says you, 'Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,' how interesting\nreading is!\"\nI derived from this, that Joe's education, like Steam, was yet in its\ninfancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,\u2014\n\"Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\"\n\"No, Pip.\"\n\"Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\"\n\"Well, Pip,\" said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his\nusual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire\nbetween the lower bars; \"I'll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given\nto drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my\nmother, most onmerciful. It were a'most the only hammering he did,\nindeed, 'xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only to\nbe equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his\nanwil.\u2014You're a listening and understanding, Pip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\n\"Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several\ntimes; and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd say, \"Joe,\"\nshe'd say, \"now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,\" and\nshe'd put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that\nhe couldn't abear to be without us. So, he'd come with a most\ntremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where\nwe was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us\nand to give us up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us.\nWhich, you see, Pip,\" said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the\nfire, and looking at me, \"were a drawback on my learning.\"\n\"Certainly, poor Joe!\"",

In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\nbetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\nhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about the\ncorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and\nflavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I\nhardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for\nnoticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by\nlooking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact\n_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to\nget on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating\nthe baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,\nwho stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always\nporing over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and\nalways inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the\nglass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the\nHigh Street whose trade engaged his attention.\nMr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlour\nbehind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of\nbread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered\nMr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my\nsister's idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be\nimparted to my diet,\u2014besides giving me as much crumb as possible in\ncombination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm\nwater into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the\nmilk out altogether,\u2014his conversation consisted of nothing but\narithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,\npompously, \"Seven times nine, boy?\" And how should _I_ be able to\nanswer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I\nwas hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum\nthat lasted all through the breakfast. \"Seven?\" \"And four?\" \"And\neight?\" \"And six?\" \"And two?\" \"And ten?\" And so on. And after each\nfigure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a\nsup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,\nand eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)\na gorging and gormandizing manner.\nFor such reasons, I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started",

Within a\nquarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham's house, which was of old\nbrick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the\nwindows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were\nrustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so\nwe had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to\nopen it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.\nPumblechook said, \"And fourteen?\" but I pretended not to hear him), and\nsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing\nwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\ntime.\nA window was raised, and a clear voice demanded \"What name?\" To which\nmy conductor replied, \"Pumblechook.\" The voice returned, \"Quite right,\"\nand the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the\ncourt-yard, with keys in her hand.\n\"This,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, \"is Pip.\"\n\"This is Pip, is it?\" returned the young lady, who was very pretty and\nseemed very proud; \"come in, Pip.\"\nMr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.\n\"Oh!\" she said. \"Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?\"\n\"If Miss Havisham wished to see me,\" returned Mr. Pumblechook,\ndiscomfited.\n\"Ah!\" said the girl; \"but you see she don't.\"\nShe said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.\nPumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not\nprotest.

I noticed that\nMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\ntaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the\ndressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now\nyellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the\nshoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now\nyellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything,\nthis standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the\nwithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like\ngrave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.\nSo she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\ntrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew\nnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies\nburied in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being\ndistinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have\nlooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have\nstruck her to dust.\n\"He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!\" said Estella with disdain,\nbefore our first game was out. \"And what coarse hands he has! And what\nthick boots!\"\nI had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to\nconsider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so\nstrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.\nShe won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I\nknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for\na stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.\n\"You say nothing of her,\" remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked\non. \"She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What\ndo you think of her?\"\n\"I don't like to say,\" I stammered.\n\"Tell me in my ear,\" said Miss Havisham, bending down.\n\"I think she is very proud,\" I replied, in a whisper.\n\"Anything else?\"\n\"I think she is very pretty.\"\n\"Anything else?\"\n\"I think she is very insulting.\" (She was looking at me then with a\nlook of supreme aversion.)\n\"Anything else?\"\n\"I think I should like to go home.\"\n\"And never see her again, though she is so pretty?\"\n\"I am not sure that I shouldn't like to see her again, but I should\nlike to go home now.\"\n\"You shall go soon,\" said Miss Havisham, aloud. \"Play the game out.\"\nSaving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure",

But there were no\npigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,\nno malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper\nor the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have\nevaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a\nwilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of\nbetter days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as\na sample of the beer that was gone,\u2014and in this respect I remember\nthose recluses as being like most others.\nBehind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\nwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\nto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\nhouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\na track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes\nwalked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But\nshe seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation\npresented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking\non them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,\nand held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never\nlooked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery\nitself,\u2014by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used\nto make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I\nfirst went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the\ndoor looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and\nascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,\nas if she were going out into the sky.\nIt was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\nto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\nstranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes\u2014a little dimmed by\nlooking up at the frosty light\u2014towards a great wooden beam in a low\nnook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\nhanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one\nshoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\nMiss Havisham's, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\nshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and\nin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\nbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\nwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.",

Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my\npence-table from \"twelve pence make one shilling,\" up to \"forty pence\nmake three and fourpence,\" and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had\ndone for me, \"_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?\" To which I\nreplied, after a long interval of reflection, \"I don't know.\" And I was\nso aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.\nMr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, and\nsaid, \"Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for\ninstance?\"\n\"Yes!\" said I.

What like is Miss Havisham?\" Mr. Pumblechook began again when he\nhad recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\nscrew.\n\"Very tall and dark,\" I told him.\n\"Is she, uncle?\" asked my sister.\nMr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he\nhad never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.\n\"Good!\" said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly.

And we all had\ncake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat\nmine, because she told me to.\"\n\"Was anybody else there?\" asked Mr. Pumblechook.\n\"Four dogs,\" said I.\n\"Large or small?\"\n\"Immense,\" said I. \"And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver\nbasket.\"\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter\namazement. I was perfectly frantic,\u2014a reckless witness under the\ntorture,\u2014and would have told them anything.\n\"Where _was_ this coach, in the name of gracious?\" asked my sister.\n\"In Miss Havisham's room.\" They stared again. \"But there weren't any\nhorses to it.\" I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting\nfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of\nharnessing.\n\"Can this be possible, uncle?\" asked Mrs. Joe. \"What can the boy mean?\"\n\"I'll tell you, Mum,\" said Mr. Pumblechook. \"My opinion is, it's a\nsedan-chair. She's flighty, you know,\u2014very flighty,\u2014quite flighty\nenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.\"\n\"Did you ever see her in it, uncle?\" asked Mrs. Joe.\n\"How could I,\" he returned, forced to the admission, \"when I never see\nher in my life?

And yet you have spoken to her?\"\n\"Why, don't you know,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, \"that when I have\nbeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the\ndoor has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don't say you\ndon't know _that_, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did\nyou play at, boy?\"\n\"We played with flags,\" I said. (I beg to observe that I think of\nmyself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)\n\"Flags!\" echoed my sister.\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and\nMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out\nat the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.\"\n\"Swords!\" repeated my sister. \"Where did you get swords from?\"\n\"Out of a cupboard,\" said I. \"And I saw pistols in it,\u2014and jam,\u2014and\npills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up\nwith candles.\"\n\"That's true, Mum,\" said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. \"That's the\nstate of the case, for that much I've seen myself.\" And then they both\nstared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\ncountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers\nwith my right hand.\nIf they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have\nbetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that\nthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement\nbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\nin the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the\nmarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I\nescaped. The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to\nhave a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own\nmind than for the gratification of his, related my pretended\nexperiences.\nNow, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\nkitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only\nas regarded him,\u2014not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards\nJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\ndebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham's\nacquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would \"do\nsomething\" for me; their doubts related to the form that something\nwould take. My sister stood out for \"property.\" Mr. Pumblechook was in\nfavour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel\ntrade,\u2014say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the\ndeepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I\nmight only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the\nveal-cutlets. \"If a fool's head can't express better opinions than\nthat,\" said my sister, \"and you have got any work to do, you had better\ngo and do it.\" So he went.",

Then I said, \"Before the fire goes out, Joe, I\nshould like to tell you something.\"\n\"Should you, Pip?\" said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\n\"Then tell us. What is it, Pip?\"\n\"Joe,\" said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\nit between my finger and thumb, \"you remember all that about Miss\nHavisham's?\"\n\"Remember?\" said Joe. \"I believe you! Wonderful!\"\n\"It's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true.\"\n\"What are you telling of, Pip?\" cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\namazement. \"You don't mean to say it's\u2014\"\n\"Yes I do; it's lies, Joe.\"\n\"But not all of it? Why sure you don't mean to say, Pip, that there was\nno black welwet co\u2014eh?\" For, I stood shaking my head. \"But at least\nthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,\" said Joe, persuasively, \"if there\nwarn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?\"\n\"No, Joe.\"\n\"A dog?\" said Joe. \"A puppy? Come?\"\n\"No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.\"\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\n\"Pip, old chap! This won't do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect\nto go to?\"\n\"It's terrible, Joe; ain't it?\"\n\"Terrible?\" cried Joe. \"Awful! What possessed you?\"\n\"I don't know what possessed me, Joe,\" I replied, letting his shirt\nsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\n\"but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\nwish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.\"\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been\nable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\nme, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's\nwho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that\nI knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the\nlies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.\nThis was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\nwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\nmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\n\"There's one thing you may be sure of, Pip,\" said Joe, after some\nrumination, \"namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn't\nought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\nthe same. Don't you tell no more of 'em, Pip. _That_ ain't the way to\nget out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don't make\nit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You're oncommon\nsmall. Likewise you're a oncommon scholar.\"\n\"No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.\"\n\"Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I've\nseen letters\u2014Ah! and from gentlefolks!\u2014that I'll swear weren't wrote in\nprint,\" said Joe.\n\"I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It's only\nthat.\"\n\"Well, Pip,\" said Joe, \"be it so or be it son't, you must be a common\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\nhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can't sit and write his acts of\nParliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\nPrince, with the alphabet.\u2014Ah!\" added Joe, with a shake of the head\nthat was full of meaning, \"and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\nAnd _I_ know what that is to do, though I can't say I've exactly done\nit.\"\nThere was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\nme.\n\"Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,\" pursued Joe,\nreflectively, \"mightn't be the better of continuing for to keep company\nwith common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\nones,\u2014which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?\"\n\"No, Joe.\"\n\"(I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\nmightn't be, is a thing as can't be looked into now, without putting\nyour sister on the Rampage; and that's a thing not to be thought of as\nbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a\ntrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can't get to\nbe oncommon through going straight, you'll never get to do it through\ngoing crooked. So don't tell no more on 'em, Pip, and live well and die\nhappy.\"\n\"You are not angry with me, Joe?\"\n\"No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of\na stunning and outdacious sort,\u2014alluding to them which bordered on\nweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,\u2014a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,\ntheir being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.\nThat's all, old chap, and don't never do it no more.\"",

In pursuance of this luminous\nconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's\ngreat-aunt's at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to\nget on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she\nwould impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging\nof girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her\npromise within five minutes.\nThe Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and\nput straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\ncollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\na birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,\nthe pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand\nto hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a\nlittle spelling,\u2014that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils\nthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the\nsubject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the\nhardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a\nrush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they\nhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more\nillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have\nsince met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various\nspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part\nof the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between\nBiddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave\nout the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,\u2014or\nwhat we couldn't\u2014in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,\nshrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or\nreverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had\nlasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt,\nwho staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was\nunderstood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into\nthe air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that\nthere was no prohibition against any pupil's entertaining himself with\na slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not\neasy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of\nthe little general shop in which the classes were holden\u2014and which was\nalso Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber\u2014being but\nfaintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle\nand no snuffers.\nIt appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under\nthese circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very\nevening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some\ninformation from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of\nmoist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D",

His head was\nall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\nmouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\nand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\nnodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\ndown there.\nBut as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\nresort, I said \"No, thank you, sir,\" and fell into the space Joe made\nfor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\nwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg\u2014in a very odd way, as\nit struck me.\n\"You was saying,\" said the strange man, turning to Joe, \"that you was a\nblacksmith.\"\n\"Yes. I said it, you know,\" said Joe.\n\"What'll you drink, Mr.\u2014? You didn't mention your name, by the bye.\"\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. \"What'll\nyou drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, \"to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of\ndrinking at anybody's expense but my own.\"\n\"Habit? No,\" returned the stranger, \"but once and away, and on a\nSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.\"\n\"I wouldn't wish to be stiff company,\" said Joe. \"Rum.\"\n\"Rum,\" repeated the stranger. \"And will the other gentleman originate a\nsentiment.\"\n\"Rum,\" said Mr. Wopsle.\n\"Three Rums!\" cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. \"Glasses\nround!\"\n\"This other gentleman,\" observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\n\"is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\nchurch.\"\n\"Aha!\" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. \"The\nlonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!\"\n\"That's it,\" said Joe.\nThe stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his\nlegs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\nbroad-brimmed traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over\nhis head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he\nlooked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\nhalf-laugh, come into his face.\n\"I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\nsolitary country towards the river.\"\n\"Most marshes is solitary,\" said Joe.\n\"No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\nvagrants of any sort, out there?\"\n\"No,\" said Joe; \"none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don't\nfind _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?\"\nMr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\nbut not warmly.\n\"Seems you have been out after such?\" asked the stranger.\n\"Once,\" returned Joe. \"Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;\nwe went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn't us,\nPip?\"\n\"Yes, Joe.\"\nThe stranger looked at me again,\u2014still cocking his eye, as if he were\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,\u2014and said, \"He's a\nlikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?\"\n\"Pip,\" said Joe.\n\"Christened Pip?\"\n\"No, not christened Pip.\"\n\"Surname Pip?\"\n\"No,\" said Joe, \"it's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\ninfant, and is called by.\"\n\"Son of yours?\"\n\"Well,\" said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\nanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\nthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\ndiscussed over pipes,\u2014\"well\u2014no. No, he ain't.\"\n\"Nevvy?\" said the strange man.\n\"Well,\" said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, \"he\nis not\u2014no, not to deceive you, he is _not_\u2014my nevvy.\"\n\"What the Blue Blazes is he?\" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\nMr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about\nrelationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female\nrelations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and\nJoe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most\nterrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to\nthink he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, \"\u2014as\nthe poet says.\"\nAnd here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he\nconsidered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and\npoke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing\nwho visited at our house should always have put me through the same\ninflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to\nmind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our\nsocial family circle, but some large-handed person took some such\nophthalmic steps to patronise me.\nAll this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\ndown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\nshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\nIt was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\npointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at\nme, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it\nand he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with a\nfile_.\nHe did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe's\nfile, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\ninstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on\nhis settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally\nabout turnips.",

This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded\nme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I\nfound when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.\nIndeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had\nany features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her\nface.\n\"Poor dear soul!\" said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my\nsister's. \"Nobody's enemy but his own!\"\n\"It would be much more commendable to be somebody else's enemy,\" said\nthe gentleman; \"far more natural.\"\n\"Cousin Raymond,\" observed another lady, \"we are to love our\nneighbour.\"\n\"Sarah Pocket,\" returned Cousin Raymond, \"if a man is not his own\nneighbour, who is?\"\nMiss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),\n\"The idea!\" But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea\ntoo. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\nemphatically, \"_Very_ true!\"\n\"Poor soul!\" Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been\nlooking at me in the mean time), \"he is so very strange!

So like Matthew!\nThe idea!\"\n\"Good points in him, good points in him,\" said Cousin Raymond; \"Heaven\nforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\nwill have, any sense of the proprieties.\"\n\"You know I was obliged,\" said Camilla,\u2014\"I was obliged to be firm. I\nsaid, 'It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.' I told him that,\nwithout deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\nbreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\nin his violent way, and said, with a D, 'Then do as you like.' Thank\nGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.\"\n\"_He_ paid for them, did he not?\" asked Estella.\n\"It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,\" returned\nCamilla. \"_I_ bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\nwhen I wake up in the night.\"\nThe ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\ncall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the\nconversation and caused Estella to say to me, \"Now, boy!\" On my turning\nround, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went\nout, I heard Sarah Pocket say, \"Well I am sure! What next!\" and Camilla",

He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him,\nand I now saw that he was inky.\n\"Halloa!\" said he, \"young fellow!\"\nHalloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be\nbest answered by itself, _I_ said, \"Halloa!\" politely omitting young\nfellow.\n\"Who let _you_ in?\" said he.\n\"Miss Estella.\"\n\"Who gave you leave to prowl about?\"\n\"Miss Estella.\"\n\"Come and fight,\" said the pale young gentleman.\nWhat could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question\nsince; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was so\nastonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a\nspell.\n\"Stop a minute, though,\" he said, wheeling round before we had gone\nmany paces. \"I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it\nis!\" In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against\none another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my\nhair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my\nstomach.\nThe bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was\nunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was\nparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit\nout at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, \"Aha! Would\nyou?\" and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite\nunparalleled within my limited experience.\n\"Laws of the game!\" said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to\nhis right. \"Regular rules!\" Here, he skipped from his right leg on to\nhis left. \"Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!\" Here,\nhe dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I\nlooked helplessly at him.\nI was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt\nmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\nhad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to\nconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I\nfollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking\nme if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he\nbegged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned\nwith a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. \"Available for\nboth,\" he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to\npulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a\nmanner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\nAlthough he did not look very healthy,\u2014having pimples on his face, and\na breaking out at his mouth,\u2014these dreadful preparations quite appalled\nme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\nthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for\nbattle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\nadvance of the rest of him as to development.\nMy heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\nminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\nas I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,\nlooking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\nfore-shortened.\nBut, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a\ngreat show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\nsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\nlooking up at me out of a black eye.\nHis spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\nstrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked\ndown; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or\ndrinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in\nseconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air\nand a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at\nlast. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I\nhit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again and\nagain, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head\nagainst the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and\nturned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;\nbut finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the\nsame time panting out, \"That means you have won.\"\nHe seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\ncontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\nso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, \"Can I help you?\"\nand he said \"No thankee,\" and I said \"Good afternoon,\" and _he_ said\n\"Same to you.\"",

Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;\nsometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite\nfamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she\nhated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we\nwere alone, \"Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\" And when I said\nyes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when\nwe played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish\nof Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods\nwere so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled\nwhat to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish\nfondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like \"Break their\nhearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\"",

This was not a very ceremonious way of\nrendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in\nthat relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure\nof beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the\nintroduction of Old Clem's respected name. Thus, you were to hammer\nboys round\u2014Old Clem! With a thump and a sound\u2014Old Clem! Beat it out,\nbeat it out\u2014Old Clem! With a clink for the stout\u2014Old Clem! Blow the\nfire, blow the fire\u2014Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher\u2014Old Clem!\nOne day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly\nsaying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, \"There,\nthere, there!

It happened so to catch her fancy that she\ntook it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.\nAfter that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,\nand Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so\nsubdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in\nthe grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.\nWhat could I become with these surroundings? How could my character\nfail to be influenced by them?

Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly\nfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger\nto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of\nhim. Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella\ndiscussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more\npotent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but\nBiddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to\ndo so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did\nnot know then, though I think I know now.",

That ass,\nPumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to\nthis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these\nhands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would\nhave done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of\nmind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before\nhim,\u2014as it were, to operate upon,\u2014and he would drag me up from my stool\n(usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me\nbefore the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,\n\"Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by\nhand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which\nso did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!\" And then he would\nrumple my hair the wrong way,\u2014which from my earliest remembrance, as\nalready hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any\nfellow-creature to do,\u2014and would hold me before him by the sleeve,\u2014a\nspectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.\nThen, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\nabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,\nthat I used to want\u2014quite painfully\u2014to burst into spiteful tears, fly\nat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\nevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.\nIn these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,\nwhile they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that he\nwas not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old\nenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into\nopposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out\nof his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating\nend to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to\nlead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching\nsight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, \"Come!\nthere's enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_'ve given trouble\nenough for one night, I hope!\" As if I had besought them as a favour to\nbother my life out.\nWe went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we\nshould continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss\nHavisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my\nshoulder; and said with some displeasure,\u2014\n\"You are growing tall, Pip!\"\nI thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look,\nthat this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no\ncontrol.\nShe said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at\nme again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and\nmoody. On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was\nover, and I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a\nmovement of her impatient fingers:\u2014\n\"Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.\"\n\"Joe Gargery, ma'am.\"\n\"Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?\"\n\"Yes, Miss Havisham.\"\n\"You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with\nyou, and bring your indentures, do you think?\"\nI signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be\nasked.\n\"Then let him come.\"\n\"At any particular time, Miss Havisham?\"\n\"There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come\nalong with you.\"",

And there my\nsister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would\nserve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue\nBoar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring\nthe Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.\nIt was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, it\ninscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole\ncompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it\nworse, they all asked me from time to time,\u2014in short, whenever they had\nnothing else to do,\u2014why I didn't enjoy myself? And what could I\npossibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,\u2014when I wasn't!\nHowever, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the\nmost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent\ncontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;\nand, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I\nplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\nto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks.\nMy only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they\nwouldn't let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,\nwoke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the\nevening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins's ode, and threw his bloodstained\nsword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and\nsaid, \"The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it\nwasn't the Tumblers' Arms.\" That, they were all in excellent spirits on\nthe road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and\nasserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive\nbore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by\nwanting to know all about everybody's private affairs) that _he_ was\nthe man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole\nthe weakest pilgrim going.\nFinally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly\nwretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like\nJoe's trade.

What is any visit made for?\"\n\"There is some wisits p'r'aps,\" said Joe, \"as for ever remains open to\nthe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might\nthink you wanted something,\u2014expected something of her.\"\n\"Don't you think I might say that I did not, Joe?\"\n\"You might, old chap,\" said Joe. \"And she might credit it. Similarly\nshe mightn't.\"\nJoe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.\n\"You see, Pip,\" Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, \"Miss\nHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the\nhandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were\nall.\"\n\"Yes, Joe. I heard her.\"\n\"ALL,\" Joe repeated, very emphatically.\n\"Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.\"\n\"Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,\u2014Make a end\non it!\u2014As you was!\u2014Me to the North, and you to the South!\u2014Keep in\nsunders!\"\nI had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to\nfind that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more\nprobable.\n\"But, Joe.\"\n\"Yes, old chap.\"\n\"Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day\nof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after\nher, or shown that I remember her.\"\n\"That's true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\nall four round,\u2014and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four\nround might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of\nhoofs\u2014\"\n\"I don't mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don't mean a present.\"\nBut Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon\nit. \"Or even,\" said he, \"if you was helped to knocking her up a new\nchain for the front door,\u2014or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws\nfor general use,\u2014or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork\nwhen she took her muffins,\u2014or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\nlike\u2014\"\n\"I don't mean any present at all, Joe,\" I interposed.\n\"Well,\" said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly\npressed it, \"if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn't. No, I would _not_. For\nwhat's a door-chain when she's got one always up? And shark-headers is\nopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you'd go\ninto brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can't\nshow himself oncommon in a gridiron,\u2014for a gridiron IS a gridiron,\"\nsaid Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring\nto rouse me from a fixed delusion, \"and you may haim at what you like,\nbut a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your\nleave, and you can't help yourself\u2014\"\n\"My dear Joe,\" I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, \"don't\ngo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any\npresent.\"\n\"No, Pip,\" Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all\nalong; \"and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.\"\n\"Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack\njust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I\nwould go uptown and make a call on Miss Est\u2014Havisham.\"\n\"Which her name,\" said Joe, gravely, \"ain't Estavisham, Pip, unless she\nhave been rechris'ened.\"\n\"I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,\nJoe?\"\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of\nit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received\nwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for\na favour received, then this experimental trip should have no\nsuccessor.

He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of\ngreat strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even\nseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by\nmere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his\ndinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the\nWandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention\nof ever coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper's out on the marshes,\nand on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his\nhands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his\nneck and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the\nsluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,\nlocomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or\notherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,\nhalf-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it\nwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.\nThis morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and\ntimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner\nof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was\nnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy,\nand that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe's 'prentice,\nOrlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace\nhim; howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything,",

And I couldn't be a match for the\nrogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and\nthe worst rogue between this and France. Now!\"\n\"You're a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,\" growled the journeyman. \"If that\nmakes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good'un.\"\n(\"Let her alone, will you?\" said Joe.)\n\"What did you say?\" cried my sister, beginning to scream. \"What did you\nsay? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,\nwith my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!\" Each of these exclamations\nwas a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of\nall the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for\nher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she\nconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself\ninto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; \"what was the\nname he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold\nme! Oh!\"\n\"Ah-h-h!\" growled the journeyman, between his teeth, \"I'd hold you, if\nyou was my wife. I'd hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.\"\n(\"I tell you, let her alone,\" said Joe.)\n\"Oh!

With my\nhusband standing by! Oh! Oh!\" Here my sister, after a fit of clappings\nand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and\nthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,\u2014which were the last stages\non her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete\nsuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.\nWhat could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical\ninterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he\nmeant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether\nhe was man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation\nadmitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence\nstraightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt\naprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in\nthat neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.\nOrlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young\ngentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come\nout of it. Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had\ndropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I\nthink), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was\nrecommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her",

Mr. Wopsle had in\nhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that\nmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on\nthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner\ndid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence\nhad put a 'prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,\nand insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour. As I\nknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the\nway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better\nthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into\nPumblechook's just as the street and the shops were lighting up.\nAs I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I\ndon't know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it\ntook until half-past nine o' clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle\ngot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he\nbecame so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful\ncareer. I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being\ncut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to\nseed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was\na mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the\nidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When\nBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively\napologetic, Pumblechook's indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,\ntoo, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and\nmaudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating\ncircumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every\noccasion; it became sheer monomania in my master's daughter to care a\nbutton for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating\nconduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general\nfeebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle\nhad closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his\nhead, and saying, \"Take warning, boy, take warning!\" as if it were a\nwell-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided\nI could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.",

And _you_'re late.\"\n\"We have been,\" said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,\u2014\"we\nhave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.\"\nOld Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all\nwent on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending\nhis half-holiday up and down town?\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn't see\nyou, but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns\nis going again.\"\n\"At the Hulks?\" said I.\n\"Ay! There's some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been\ngoing since dark, about. You'll hear one presently.\"\nIn effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the\nwell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily\nrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing\nand threatening the fugitives.\n\"A good night for cutting off in,\" said Orlick. \"We'd be puzzled how to\nbring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.\"\nThe subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in\nsilence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening's\ntragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,\nwith his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very\ndark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the\nsound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled\nsulkily along the course of the river.

I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\nlaying it down.\n\"Biddy,\" said I, \"how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\nare very clever.\"\n\"What is it that I manage? I don't know,\" returned Biddy, smiling.\nShe managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\nmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\n\"How do you manage, Biddy,\" said I, \"to learn everything that I learn,\nand always to keep up with me?\" I was beginning to be rather vain of my\nknowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\ngreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have\nno doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\n\"I might as well ask you,\" said Biddy, \"how _you_ manage?\"\n\"No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\nme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.\"\n\"I suppose I must catch it like a cough,\" said Biddy, quietly; and went\non with her sewing.\nPursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\nBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her\nrather an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was\nequally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our\ndifferent sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I\nknew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith\nas I, or better.\n\"You are one of those, Biddy,\" said I, \"who make the most of every\nchance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how\nimproved you are!\"\nBiddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. \"I was\nyour first teacher though; wasn't I?\" said she, as she sewed.",

It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I\nanswered, \"The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's, and she's more\nbeautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I\nwant to be a gentleman on her account.\" Having made this lunatic\nconfession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I\nhad some thoughts of following it.\n\"Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?\"\nBiddy quietly asked me, after a pause.\n\"I don't know,\" I moodily answered.\n\"Because, if it is to spite her,\" Biddy pursued, \"I should think\u2014but\nyou know best\u2014that might be better and more independently done by\ncaring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should\nthink\u2014but you know best\u2014she was not worth gaining over.\"\nExactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was\nperfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed\nvillage lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and\nwisest of men fall every day?\n\"It may be all quite true,\" said I to Biddy, \"but I admire her\ndreadfully.\"\nIn short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good\ngrasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All\nthe while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and\nmisplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face\nright, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the\npebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.\nBiddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.\nShe put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by",

He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,\nbut used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,\nand convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger,\nI had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he\nwould have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\nBiddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\n\"Don't let him come; I don't like him.\" As I did not like him either, I\ntook the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn't want\nseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\nlaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\ndistance.\nCurious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give\nany account, I asked her why she did not like him.\n\"Oh!\" she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\n\"because I\u2014I am afraid he likes me.\"\n\"Did he ever tell you he liked you?\" I asked indignantly.\n\"No,\" said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, \"he never told me\nso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.\"\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation.

He had struck root in Joe's establishment, by reason of\nmy sister's sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\ndismissed.

Come!\nDo you make that of it?\"\nMr. Wopsle answered, \"Those are not the exact words.\"\n\"Not the exact words!\" repeated the gentleman bitterly. \"Is that the\nexact substance?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Wopsle.\n\"Yes,\" repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company\nwith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. \"And now I\nask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that\npassage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having\npronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?\"\nWe all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought\nhim, and that he was beginning to be found out.\n\"And that same man, remember,\" pursued the gentleman, throwing his\nfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,\u2014\"that same man might be summoned as a\njuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed\nhimself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon\nhis pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly\ntry the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the\nprisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the\nevidence, so help him God!\"\nWe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too\nfar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet\ntime.\nThe strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and\nwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\nus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to",

While going along, the strange\ngentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of\nhis finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion\nas an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front\ndoor. Our conference was held in the state parlour, which was feebly\nlighted by one candle.\nIt began with the strange gentleman's sitting down at the table,\ndrawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his\npocket-book. He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little\naside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to\nascertain which was which.\n\"My name,\" he said, \"is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am\npretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I\ncommence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice\nhad been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you\nsee me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I\ndo. No less, no more.\"\nFinding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got\nup, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus\nhaving one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.\n\"Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of\nthis young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his\nindentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for\nso doing?\"\n\"Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's\nway,\" said Joe, staring.\n\"Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,\" returned Mr.\nJaggers. \"The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\nanything?\"\n\"The answer is,\" returned Joe, sternly, \"No.\"\nI thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool\nfor his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between\nbreathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"Recollect the admission you have made,\nand don't try to go from it presently.\"\n\"Who's a-going to try?\" retorted Joe.\n\"I don't say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?\"\n\"Yes, I do keep a dog.\"\n\"Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\nBear that in mind, will you?\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\nand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\n\"Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got\nto make is, that he has great expectations.\"\nJoe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\n\"I am instructed to communicate to him,\" said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\nfinger at me sideways, \"that he will come into a handsome property.\nFurther, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\nproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of\nlife and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,\u2014in a word,\nas a young fellow of great expectations.\"",

Joe scooped his eyes\nwith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but\nsaid not another word.\nMr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe the\nvillage idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said,\nweighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:\u2014\n\"Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half\nmeasures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in\ncharge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the\ncontrary you mean to say\u2014\" Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped\nby Joe's suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell\npugilistic purpose.\n\"Which I meantersay,\" cried Joe, \"that if you come into my place\nbull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if\nyou're a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay\nand stand or fall by!\"\nI drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to\nme, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\none whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a-going to be\nbull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when\nJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing any\ninclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory\nremarks. They were these.\n\"Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here\u2014as you are to be a\ngentleman\u2014the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall\nreceive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a\nhackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to\nme. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the\ntrust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now,\nunderstand that, finally. Understand that!\"\nHe was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\non, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\nSomething came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he\nwas going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired\ncarriage.\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.\"\n\"Halloa!\" said he, facing round, \"what's the matter?\"\n\"I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;\nso I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my\ntaking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?\"\n\"No,\" said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\n\"I don't mean in the village only, but up town?\"\n\"No,\" said he. \"No objection.\"\nI thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had\nalready locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and was\nseated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at\nthe burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the\ncoals, and nothing was said for a long time.\nMy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at\nher needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next\nJoe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the\nglowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the\nlonger the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\nAt length I got out, \"Joe, have you told Biddy?\"\n\"No, Pip,\" returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\nknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to\nmake off somewhere, \"which I left it to yourself, Pip.\"\n\"I would rather you told, Joe.\"\n\"Pip's a gentleman of fortun' then,\" said Joe, \"and God bless him in\nit!\"\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\nat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\ncongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\ncongratulations that I rather resented.\nI took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with\nthe grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and\nsay nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in\ngood time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,\nsave that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.",

To the best of my belief, those efforts\nentirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,\nand even repeated after Biddy, the words \"Pip\" and \"Property.\" But I\ndoubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I\ncannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.\nI never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy\nbecame more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.\nDissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is\npossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied\nwith myself.\nAnyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,\nlooking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and\nabout what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I\ncaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\noften looked at me,\u2014particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\nwere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\nby word or sign.\nAt those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\ndoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings\nto air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am\nafraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the\nrustic objects among which I had passed my life.\n\"Saturday night,\" said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\nand beer. \"Five more days, and then the day before _the_ day! They'll\nsoon go.\"\n\"Yes, Pip,\" observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\n\"They'll soon go.\"\n\"Soon, soon go,\" said Biddy.\n\"I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\norder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put\nthem on there, or that I'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook's. It\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.\"\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\ntoo, Pip,\" said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese\non it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. \"So might\nWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.\"\n\"That's just what I don't want, Joe. They would make such a business of\nit,\u2014such a coarse and common business,\u2014that I couldn't bear myself.\"\n\"Ah, that indeed, Pip!\" said Joe. \"If you couldn't abear yourself\u2014\"\nBiddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister's plate, \"Have you\nthought about when you'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister\nand me? You will show yourself to us; won't you?\"\n\"Biddy,\" I returned with some resentment, \"you are so exceedingly quick\nthat it's difficult to keep up with you.\"\n(\"She always were quick,\" observed Joe.)\n\"If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\nthat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,\u2014most likely\non the evening before I go away.\"\nBiddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\naffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I\ngot into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a\nmean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,\nfor ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even\nat the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\nbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\nso often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.\nThe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\nthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I\nsaw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or\ntwo in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and\nlight it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me\nthat he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.\nHe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his\npipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew\nthat they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing\ntone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for\nmore, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and\nsat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and\nstrange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the\nloneliest I had ever known.\nLooking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe's pipe\nfloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,\u2014not\nobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\ntogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\nbed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.",

Joe is a dear good fellow,\u2014in fact, I think he is the dearest\nfellow that ever lived,\u2014but he is rather backward in some things. For\ninstance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.\"\nAlthough I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her\neyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.\n\"O, his manners! won't his manners do then?\" asked Biddy, plucking a\nblack-currant leaf.\n\"My dear Biddy, they do very well here\u2014\"\n\"O! they _do_ very well here?\" interrupted Biddy, looking closely at\nthe leaf in her hand.\n\"Hear me out,\u2014but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I\nshall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would\nhardly do him justice.\"\n\"And don't you think he knows that?\" asked Biddy.\nIt was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most\ndistant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,\u2014\n\"Biddy, what do you mean?\"\nBiddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,\u2014and the\nsmell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that\nevening in the little garden by the side of the lane,\u2014said, \"Have you\nnever considered that he may be proud?\"\n\"Proud?\" I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.\n\"O! there are many kinds of pride,\" said Biddy, looking full at me and\nshaking her head; \"pride is not all of one kind\u2014\"\n\"Well? What are you stopping for?\" said I.\n\"Not all of one kind,\" resumed Biddy. \"He may be too proud to let any\none take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills\nwell and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it\nsounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I\ndo.\"\n\"Now, Biddy,\" said I, \"I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not\nexpect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You\nare dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can't help\nshowing it.\"\n\"If you have the heart to think so,\" returned Biddy, \"say so. Say so\nover and over again, if you have the heart to think so.\"\n\"If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,\" said I, in a\nvirtuous and superior tone; \"don't put it off upon me. I am very sorry\nto see it, and it's a\u2014it's a bad side of human nature. I did intend to\nask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was\ngone, of improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am\nextremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,\" I repeated. \"It's a\u2014it's a\nbad side of human nature.\"\n\"Whether you scold me or approve of me,\" returned poor Biddy, \"you may\nequally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at\nall times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no\ndifference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be\nunjust neither,\" said Biddy, turning away her head.",

There were not so many papers\nabout, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd\nobjects about, that I should not have expected to see,\u2014such as an old\nrusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and\npackages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly\nswollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed\nchair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,\nlike a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and\nbit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the\nclients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the\nwall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with\nshoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled\nforth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being\nturned out.\nI sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's\nchair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I\ncalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\neverybody else's disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many\nother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have\nthe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what\nwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came\nthere. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's\nfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\nill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\nblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.\nOf course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits\nmay have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and\ngrit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in\nMr. Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts\non the shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.",

Amelia, is it?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Jaggers.\"\n\"And do you remember,\" retorted Mr. Jaggers, \"that but for me you\nwouldn't be here and couldn't be here?\"\n\"O yes, sir!\" exclaimed both women together. \"Lord bless you, sir, well\nwe knows that!\"\n\"Then why,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"do you come here?\"\n\"My Bill, sir!\" the crying woman pleaded.\n\"Now, I tell you what!\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"Once for all. If you don't\nknow that your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you come here\nbothering about your Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and\nyou, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?\"\n\"O yes, sir! Every farden.\"\n\"Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another\nword\u2014one single word\u2014and Wemmick shall give you your money back.\"\nThis terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No\none remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the\nskirts of Mr. Jaggers's coat to his lips several times.\n\"I don't know this man!\" said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating\nstrain: \"What does this fellow want?\"\n\"Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?\"\n\"Who's he?\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"Let go of my coat.\"\nThe suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing\nit, replied, \"Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.\"\n\"You're too late,\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"I am over the way.\"\n\"Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!\" cried my excitable acquaintance,\nturning white, \"don't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!\"\n\"I am,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"and there's an end of it. Get out of the\nway.\"\n\"Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen'th gone to Mithter\nWemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter\nJaggerth!

Without further\ninterruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and\nthe man in velveteen with the fur cap.\n\"Here's Mike,\" said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and\napproaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of\nhair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling\nat the bell-rope; \"your man comes on this afternoon. Well?\"\n\"Well, Mas'r Jaggers,\" returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a\nconstitutional cold; \"arter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, sir, as\nmight do.\"\n\"What is he prepared to swear?\"\n\"Well, Mas'r Jaggers,\" said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this\ntime; \"in a general way, anythink.\"\nMr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. \"Now, I warned you before,\"\nsaid he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, \"that if you\never presumed to talk in that way here, I'd make an example of you. You\ninfernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?\"\nThe client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious\nwhat he had done.\n\"Spooney!\" said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his\nelbow. \"Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?\"\n\"Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,\" said my guardian, very sternly,\n\"once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is\nprepared to swear?\"\nMike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson\nfrom his face, and slowly replied, \"Ayther to character, or to having\nbeen in his company and never left him all the night in question.\"\n\"Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?\"\nMike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the\nceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before\nbeginning to reply in a nervous manner, \"We've dressed him up like\u2014\"\nwhen my guardian blustered out,\u2014\n\"What? You WILL, will you?\"\n(\"Spooney!\" added the clerk again, with another stir.)\nAfter some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:\u2014\n\"He is dressed like a 'spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.\"\n\"Is he here?\" asked my guardian.\n\"I left him,\" said Mike, \"a setting on some doorsteps round the\ncorner.\"\n\"Take him past that window, and let me see him.\"\nThe window indicated was the office window. We all three went to it,\nbehind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an\naccidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short\nsuit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was\nnot by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of\nrecovery, which was painted over.\n\"Tell him to take his witness away directly,\" said my guardian to the\nclerk, in extreme disgust, \"and ask him what he means by bringing such\na fellow as that.\"",

Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but\nthat's no fault of mine.\"\nAfter I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked\nMr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach?

      "text": "Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was\nlike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in\nstature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have\nbeen imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some\nmarks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been\nsofter and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.\nThe chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment\nover his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them\noff. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his\nlinen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for\nhe wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a\nlady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,\nthat several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were\nquite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering\neyes,\u2014small, keen, and black,\u2014and thin wide mottled lips. He had had\nthem, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.\n\"So you were never in London before?\" said Mr. Wemmick to me.\n\"No,\" said I.\n\"_I_ was new here once,\" said Mr. Wemmick. \"Rum to think of now!\"\n\"You are well acquainted with it now?\"\n\"Why, yes,\" said Mr. Wemmick. \"I know the moves of it.\"\n\"Is it a very wicked place?\" I asked, more for the sake of saying\nsomething than for information.\n\"You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\nplenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.\"\n\"If there is bad blood between you and them,\" said I, to soften it off\na little.\n\"O! I don't know about bad blood,\" returned Mr. Wemmick; \"there's not\nmuch bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by\nit.\"\n\"That makes it worse.\"\n\"You think so?\" returned Mr. Wemmick. \"Much about the same, I should\nsay.\"\nHe wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before\nhim: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the\nstreets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a\nmouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the\ntop of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical\nappearance, and that he was not smiling at all.\n\"Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?\" I asked Mr. Wemmick.\n\"Yes,\" said he, nodding in the direction. \"At Hammersmith, west of\nLondon.\"\n\"Is that far?\"\n\"Well! Say five miles.\"\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\"Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!\" said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me\nwith an approving air. \"Yes, I know him. _I_ know him!\"\nThere was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\nthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways\nat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,\nwhen he said here we were at Barnard's Inn. My depression was not\nalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\nto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\nwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a\ndisembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection\nof shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club\nfor Tom-cats.\nWe entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\nlike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\nit, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the\nmost dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever\nseen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those\nhouses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and\ncurtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable\nmakeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,\nas if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of\nBarnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the\npresent occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy\nmourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,\nand it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and\nhumiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry\nrot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and\ncellar,\u2014rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand\nbesides\u2014addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,\n\"Try Barnard's Mixture.\"\nSo imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great\nexpectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. \"Ah!\" said he,\nmistaking me; \"the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does\nme.\"\nHe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,\u2014which\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\nthemselves without the means of coming down,\u2014to a set of chambers on\nthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\na label on the letter-box, \"Return shortly.\"\n\"He hardly thought you'd come so soon,\" Mr. Wemmick explained. \"You\ndon't want me any more?\"\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\n\"As I keep the cash,\" Mr. Wemmick observed, \"we shall most likely meet\npretty often. Good day.\"\n\"Good day.\"\nI put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he\nthought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\nhimself,\u2014\n\"To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?\"\nI was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\nbut said yes.\n\"I have got so out of it!\" said Mr. Wemmick,\u2014\"except at last. Very\nglad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!\"",

Gradually there arose\nbefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\nmember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\nbreath.\n\"Mr. Pip?\" said he.\n\"Mr. Pocket?\" said I.\n\"Dear me!\" he exclaimed. \"I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\ncoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\ncome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,\u2014not\nthat that is any excuse,\u2014for I thought, coming from the country, you\nmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\nMarket to get it good.\"\nFor a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\nhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think\nthis was a dream.\n\"Dear me!\" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \"This door sticks so!\"\nAs he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\nthe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\nthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\nthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\nthat he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\ndoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start\nout of my head, and as if this must be a dream.\n\"Pray come in,\" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \"Allow me to lead the way. I\nam rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably\nwell till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably\nthrough to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk\nabout London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As\nto our table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied\nfrom our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your\nexpense, such being Mr. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's\nnot by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my\nfather hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take\nit, if he had. This is our sitting-room,\u2014just such chairs and tables\nand carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You\nmustn't give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,\nbecause they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little\nbedroom; rather musty, but Barnard's _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;\nthe furniture's hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the\npurpose; if you should want anything, I'll go and fetch it. The\nchambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan't\nfight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the\nfruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite\nashamed.\"\nAs I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,\nOne, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I\nknew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,\u2014\n\"Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!\"\n\"And you,\" said I, \"are the pale young gentleman!\"",

And unless I deceive myself on a point where my\ninterests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.\nand Mrs. Pocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but\nwere tumbling up.\nMrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\nher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids\nwere looking about them while the children played. \"Mamma,\" said\nHerbert, \"this is young Mr. Pip.\" Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity.\n\"Master Alick and Miss Jane,\" cried one of the nurses to two of the\nchildren, \"if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over\ninto the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?\"\nAt the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket's handkerchief, and\nsaid, \"If that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!\" Upon which\nMrs. Pocket laughed and said, \"Thank you, Flopson,\" and settling\nherself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance\nimmediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been\nreading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,\nshe fixed her eyes upon me, and said, \"I hope your mamma is quite\nwell?\" This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I\nbegan saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such\nperson I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have\nbeen very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the\nnurse came to my rescue.\n\"Well!\" she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, \"if that don't\nmake seven times! What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!\" Mrs.\nPocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\nrecognition, and said, \"Thank you, Flopson,\" and forgot me, and went on\nreading.\nI found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\nsix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the\nregion of air, wailing dolefully.\n\"If there ain't Baby!\" said Flopson, appearing to think it most\nsurprising. \"Make haste up, Millers.\"\nMillers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by\ndegrees the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a\nyoung ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all\nthe time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\nWe were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\nrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\nnear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\ntumbled over her,\u2014always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\ntheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\nthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\nspeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\nwhich baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\nPocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\nand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\n\"Gracious me, Flopson!\" said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\nmoment, \"everybody's tumbling!\"\n\"Gracious you, indeed, Mum!\" returned Flopson, very red in the face;\n\"what have you got there?\"\n\"_I_ got here, Flopson?\" asked Mrs. Pocket.\n\"Why, if it ain't your footstool!\" cried Flopson. \"And if you keep it\nunder your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here! Take the\nbaby, Mum, and give me your book.\"\nMrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\nlittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\nlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made\nthe second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the\nlittle Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\nUnder these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the\nchildren into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket\ncame out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to\nfind that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression\nof face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he\ndidn't quite see his way to putting anything straight.",

There were four little girls, and two little\nboys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby's next\nsuccessor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and\nMillers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been\nrecruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.\nPocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she\nrather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but\ndidn't quite know what to make of them.\n\"Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,\" said Flopson. \"Don't\ntake it that way, or you'll get its head under the table.\"\nThus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon\nthe table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious\nconcussion.\n\"Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,\" said Flopson; \"and Miss Jane, come\nand dance to baby, do!\"\nOne of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely\ntaken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place\nby me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and\nlaughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the\nmeantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,\nand we all laughed and were glad.\nFlopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,\nthen got it safely into Mrs. Pocket's lap, and gave it the nut-crackers\nto play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice\nthat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its\neyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the\ntwo nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase\nwith a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly\nlost half his buttons at the gaming-table.\nI was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket's falling into a\ndiscussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a\nsliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the\nbaby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.\nAt length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled,\nsoftly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the\ndangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the\nsame time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,\u2014\n\"You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!\"\n\"Mamma dear,\" lisped the little girl, \"baby ood have put hith eyeth\nout.\"\n\"How dare you tell me so?\" retorted Mrs. Pocket. \"Go and sit down in\nyour chair this moment!\"\nMrs. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if\nI myself had done something to rouse it.\n\"Belinda,\" remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,\n\"how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the\nprotection of baby.\"\n\"I will not allow anybody to interfere,\" said Mrs. Pocket. \"I am\nsurprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of\ninterference.\"\n\"Good God!\" cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.\n\"Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to\nsave them?\"\n\"I will not be interfered with by Jane,\" said Mrs. Pocket, with a\nmajestic glance at that innocent little offender. \"I hope I know my\npoor grandpapa's position. Jane, indeed!\"\nMr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did\nlift himself some inches out of his chair. \"Hear this!\" he helplessly\nexclaimed to the elements. \"Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for\npeople's poor grandpapa's positions!\" Then he let himself down again,\nand became silent.",

He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he\nreferred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed\nfor any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my\ndestiny if I could \"hold my own\" with the average of young men in\nprosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to\nthe contrary.\nHe advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition\nof such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the\nfunctions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that\nwith intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,\nand should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his\nway of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself\non confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state\nat once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his\ncompact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling\nmine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no\ndoubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no\nsuch excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever\nregard him as having anything ludicrous about him\u2014or anything but what\nwas serious, honest, and good\u2014in his tutor communication with me.\nWhen these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had\nbegun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my\nbedroom in Barnard's Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my\nmanners would be none the worse for Herbert's society. Mr. Pocket did\nnot object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could\npossibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt",

No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except\none,\u2014and she wasn't of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn't\nhave caught _her_ looking after this urn, unless there was something to\ndrink in it.\" Wemmick's attention being thus directed to his brooch, he\nput down the cast, and polished the brooch with his\npocket-handkerchief.\n\"Did that other creature come to the same end?\" I asked. \"He has the\nsame look.\"\n\"You're right,\" said Wemmick; \"it's the genuine look. Much as if one\nnostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, he\ncame to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He\nforged wills, this blade did, if he didn't also put the supposed\ntestators to sleep too.

As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood\nbefore me, dusting his hands.\n\"O yes,\" he returned, \"these are all gifts of that kind. One brings\nanother, you see; that's the way of it. I always take 'em. They're\ncuriosities. And they're property. They may not be worth much, but,\nafter all, they're property and portable.

And there's another rum\nthing in his house,\" proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if\nthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood; \"he never lets a\ndoor or window be fastened at night.\"\n\"Is he never robbed?\"\n\"That's it!\" returned Wemmick. \"He says, and gives it out publicly, \"I\nwant to see the man who'll rob _me_.\" Lord bless you, I have heard him,\na hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in\nour front office, \"You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn\nthere; why don't you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can't I\ntempt you?\" Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on,\nfor love or money.\"\n\"They dread him so much?\" said I.\n\"Dread him,\" said Wemmick. \"I believe you they dread him. Not but what\nhe's artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia\nmetal, every spoon.\"\n\"So they wouldn't have much,\" I observed, \"even if they\u2014\"\n\"Ah! But _he_ would have much,\" said Wemmick, cutting me short, \"and\nthey know it. He'd have their lives, and the lives of scores of 'em.\nHe'd have all he could get. And it's impossible to say what he couldn't\nget, if he gave his mind to it.\"\nI was falling into meditation on my guardian's greatness, when Wemmick\nremarked:\u2014\n\"As to the absence of plate, that's only his natural depth, you know. A\nriver's its natural depth, and he's his natural depth. Look at his\nwatch-chain. That's real enough.\"\n\"It's very massive,\" said I.\n\"Massive?\" repeated Wemmick. \"I think so. And his watch is a gold\nrepeater, and worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny. Mr. Pip,\nthere are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about\nthat watch; there's not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who\nwouldn't identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it\nwas red hot, if inveigled into touching it.\"\nAt first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a\nmore general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the\nroad, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the\ndistrict of Walworth.",

As we walked along\nwestward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of\nthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he\nnever otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody\nrecognised him.\nHe conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side\nof that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in\nwant of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and\nopened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and\nlittle used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark\nbrown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the\npanelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know\nwhat kind of loops I thought they looked like.\nDinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\ndressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the\nwhole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was\ncomfortably laid\u2014no silver in the service, of course\u2014and at the side of\nhis chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and\ndecanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed\nthroughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed\neverything himself.",

      "text": "There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\nthat they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,\ntrials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very\nsolid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,\nand there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a\nlittle table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring\nthe office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\nevening and fall to work.\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,\u2014for he and I had\nwalked together,\u2014he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\n\"Pip,\" said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\nthe window, \"I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?\"\n\"The spider?\" said I.\n\"The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.\"\n\"That's Bentley Drummle,\" I replied; \"the one with the delicate face is\nStartop.\"\nNot making the least account of \"the one with the delicate face,\" he\nreturned, \"Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\nfellow.\"\nHe immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to\nscrew discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came\nbetween me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,\u2014but I may have thought her\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\npale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious\nexpression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see\nMacbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked\nto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had\nseen rise out of the Witches' caldron.\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\nat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\nplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\na dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own\nstriking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that\nwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and\na purpose of always holding her in suspense.",

      "text": "Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\nthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\nour dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing\nmy tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to\nboast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my\nlips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\nIt was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible\nagency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity\nabout this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show\nhow muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in\na ridiculous manner.\nNow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap,\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\n\"If you talk of strength,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"_I_'ll show you a wrist.\nMolly, let them see your wrist.\"\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\nhand behind her waist. \"Master,\" she said, in a low voice, with her\neyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. \"Don't.\"\n\"_I_'ll show you a wrist,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\ndetermination to show it. \"Molly, let them see your wrist.\"\n\"Master,\" she again murmured. \"Please!\"\n\"Molly,\" said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\nat the opposite side of the room, \"let them see _both_ your wrists.\nShow them. Come!\"\nHe took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\nbrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\nside. The last wrist was much disfigured,\u2014deeply scarred and scarred\nacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\nMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\nin succession.\n\"There's power here,\" said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\nwith his forefinger. \"Very few men have the power of wrist that this\nwoman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\nhands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\nstronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.\"\nWhile he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\nhe ceased, she looked at him again. \"That'll do, Molly,\" said Mr.\nJaggers, giving her a slight nod; \"you have been admired, and can go.\"",

Pray make\nthe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I\ndrink to you.\"\nIf his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,\nit perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose\ndepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,\nuntil he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.\nJaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed\nto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers's wine.\nIn our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,\nand I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some\nboorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free with\nour money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that\nit came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\npresence but a week or so before.\n\"Well,\" retorted Drummle; \"he'll be paid.\"\n\"I don't mean to imply that he won't,\" said I, \"but it might make you\nhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.\"\n\"_You_ should think!\" retorted Drummle. \"Oh Lord!\"\n\"I dare say,\" I went on, meaning to be very severe, \"that you wouldn't\nlend money to any of us if we wanted it.\"\n\"You are right,\" said Drummle. \"I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence.\nI wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.\"\n\"Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.\"\n\"_You_ should say,\" repeated Drummle. \"Oh Lord!\"\nThis was so very aggravating\u2014the more especially as I found myself\nmaking no way against his surly obtuseness\u2014that I said, disregarding\nHerbert's efforts to check me,\u2014\n\"Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what\npassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.\"\n\"_I_ don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,\"\ngrowled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.\n\"I'll tell you, however,\" said I, \"whether you want to know or not. We\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.\"\nDrummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\nit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\nHereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\nI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\nbeing a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\nopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\npersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\nus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,\nDrummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his\npockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and\nwould have flung it at his adversary's head, but for our entertainer's\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\npurpose.\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, \"I am exceedingly\nsorry to announce that it's half past nine.\"\nOn this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\nStartop was cheerily calling Drummle \"old boy,\" as if nothing had\nhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\neven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\nwho remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\nStartop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the\nhouses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.",

While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being\nso interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of\nsuspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see _him_, he\nwouldn't have been quite so brisk about it.\nHowever, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and\nI got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and\nbreakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately\nthe morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact\nthat Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some\nweak giant of a Sweep.\nAs the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger\npursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the\nstaircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming\nupstairs,\u2014his state boots being always too big for him,\u2014and by the time",

It came out that the whole of the\nback of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and\nthat there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in\nfront behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had\ntaken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,\nand said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such\nvillainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and\ninfamous, and shameful, and I don't know what else. At this time the\ncoach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing\nto get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,\u2014bringing\nwith them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and\nhearthstone, which attends the convict presence.\n\"Don't take it so much amiss, sir,\" pleaded the keeper to the angry\npassenger; \"I'll sit next you myself. I'll put 'em on the outside of\nthe row. They won't interfere with you, sir. You needn't know they're\nthere.\"\n\"And don't blame _me_,\" growled the convict I had recognised. \"_I_\ndon't want to go. _I_ am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am\nconcerned any one's welcome to _my_ place.\"\n\"Or mine,\" said the other, gruffly. \"_I_ wouldn't have incommoded none\nof you, if I'd had _my_ way.\" Then they both laughed, and began\ncracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.\u2014As I really think I\nshould have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so\ndespised.\nAt length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,\nand that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So\nhe got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into\nthe place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as\nthey could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his\nbreath on the hair of my head.",

      "text": "\"Good-bye, Handel!\" Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a\nblessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.\nIt is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's\nbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\nsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\nbreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\ndoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,\nin my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.\nThe weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us\nall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way\nHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed\noff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\nand how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\nwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\nquestion up again.\nBut I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I\ncould recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\nshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\nblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\nthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\nwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\nmy own thought, \"Two One Pound notes.\"\n\"How did he get 'em?\" said the convict I had never seen.\n\"How should I know?\" returned the other. \"He had 'em stowed away\nsomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.\"\n\"I wish,\" said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, \"that I\nhad 'em here.\"\n\"Two one pound notes, or friends?\"\n\"Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\nthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says\u2014?\"\n\"So he says,\" resumed the convict I had recognised,\u2014\"it was all said\nand done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\nDock-yard,\u2014'You're a-going to be discharged?' Yes, I was. Would I find\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\none pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.\"\n\"More fool you,\" growled the other. \"I'd have spent 'em on a Man, in\nwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\nnothing of you?\"\n\"Not a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried\nagain for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.\"\n\"And was that\u2014Honour!\u2014the only time you worked out, in this part of the\ncountry?\"\n\"The only time.\"\n\"What might have been your opinion of the place?\"\n\"A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\nmist, and mudbank.\"\nThey both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\ngrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.\nAfter overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and\nbeen left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling\ncertain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not\nonly so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and\nso differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could\nhave known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our\nbeing together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a\ndread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in\nhis hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as\nsoon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This\ndevice I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot\nunder my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down\nbefore me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the\nfirst stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their\nway with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off\nto the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting\nfor them at the slime-washed stairs,\u2014again heard the gruff \"Give way,\nyou!\" like and order to dogs,\u2014again saw the wicked Noah's Ark lying out\non the black water.\nI could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether\nundefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on\nto the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension\nof a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am\nconfident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the\nrevival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.",

I had stopped to\nlook at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked\nwindows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with\nits twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich\nattractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the\ninspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had\ntaken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so\nset upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had\nbeen all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her\nwith any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this\nplace, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be\nfollowed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the\nconventional notion of a lover cannot be always true.

Once for all; I knew to my\nsorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against\nreason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against\nhappiness, against all discouragement that could be.

Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been\nworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an\nelegant lady whom I had never seen.\n\"Come in, Pip,\" Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking\nround or up; \"come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as\nif I were a queen, eh?\u2014Well?\"\nShe looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a\ngrimly playful manner,\u2014\n\"Well?\"\n\"I heard, Miss Havisham,\" said I, rather at a loss, \"that you were so\nkind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.\"\n\"Well?\"\nThe lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked\narchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella's eyes.

      "text": "So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I\nhad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;\nI, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,\nquite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As\nwe drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,\u2014\n\"I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\nthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.\"\n\"You rewarded me very much.\"\n\"Did I?\" she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. \"I remember I\nentertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.\"\n\"He and I are great friends now.\"\n\"Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nI made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\nlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\n\"Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\ncompanions,\" said Estella.\n\"Naturally,\" said I.\n\"And necessarily,\" she added, in a haughty tone; \"what was fit company\nfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.\"\nIn my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\nintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\nit to flight.\n\"You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?\" said\nEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\ntimes.\n\"Not the least.\"\nThe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\nside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\nhers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\nmore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\nso set apart for her and assigned to her.\nThe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\ninto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\nwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\ncareless look in that direction, \"Did I?\" I reminded her where she had\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, \"I\ndon't remember.\" \"Not remember that you made me cry?\" said I. \"No,\"\nsaid she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe\nthat her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry\nagain, inwardly,\u2014and that is the sharpest crying of all.\n\"You must know,\" said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\nbeautiful woman might, \"that I have no heart,\u2014if that has anything to\ndo with my memory.\"\nI got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\ndoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\nwithout it.\n\"Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,\" said\nEstella, \"and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But\nyou know what I mean. I have no softness there,\nno\u2014sympathy\u2014sentiment\u2014nonsense.\"\nWhat _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\nlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?\nNo. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of\nresemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been\nacquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much\nassociated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will\nproduce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces\nthat are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to\nMiss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,\nthe suggestion was gone.\nWhat _was_ it?\n\"I am serious,\" said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow\nwas smooth) as with a darkening of her face; \"if we are to be thrown\nmuch together, you had better believe it at once. No!\" imperiously\nstopping me as I opened my lips. \"I have not bestowed my tenderness\nanywhere. I have never had any such thing.\"\nIn another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\npointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\nfirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to\nhave seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand,\nagain the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed\nme. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.\nInstantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.\nWhat _was_ it?\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Estella. \"Are you scared again?\"\n\"I should be, if I believed what you said just now,\" I replied, to turn\nit off.\n\"Then you don't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\nsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\nlaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\nof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\ncruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.\"\nHer handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\nnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\nbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it\ncould not have been more cherished in my remembrance.\nThere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\nwe were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\nin her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\nbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my\ndelight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness",

      "text": "had chosen us for one another. Wretched boy!\nAt last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\nthat my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\nwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while\nwe were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\nIt was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in\nthe funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\nchair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and\nbeautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\nThe time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\nand Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\nof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\nstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\ncloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\ndoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful.\nThen, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\nsaid in a whisper,\u2014\n\"Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?\"\n\"Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.\"\nShe drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\nshe sat in the chair. \"Love her, love her, love her! How does she use\nyou?\"\nBefore I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\nat all) she repeated, \"Love her, love her, love her! If she favours\nyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\npieces,\u2014and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,\u2014love\nher, love her, love her!\"\nNever had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\nutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm\nround my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\n\"Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\nto be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\nLove her!\"\nShe said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\nmeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead\nof love\u2014despair\u2014revenge\u2014dire death\u2014it could not have sounded from her\nlips more like a curse.\n\"I'll tell you,\" said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,\n\"what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning\nself-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself\nand against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the\nsmiter\u2014as I did!\"\nWhen she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\nher round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\ndress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck\nherself against the wall and fallen dead.\nAll this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\nwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\nthe room.\nHe always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\npocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\nof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as\nif he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or\nwitness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\ndirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he\nhad this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking\nat us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent\npause in that attitude, \"Indeed? Singular!\" and then put the\nhandkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.\nMiss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)\nafraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever.\n\"As punctual as ever,\" he repeated, coming up to us. \"(How do you do,\nPip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you\nare here, Pip?\"\nI told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\ncome and see Estella. To which he replied, \"Ah! Very fine young lady!\"\nThen he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\nlarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\nwere full of secrets.\n\"Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?\" said he, when\nhe came to a stop.\n\"How often?\"\n\"Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?\"\n\"Oh! Certainly not so many.\"\n\"Twice?\"\n\"Jaggers,\" interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, \"leave my Pip\nalone, and go with him to your dinner.\"\nHe complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\nyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\nand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\ntimes and once.\nI considered, and said, \"Never.\"\n\"And never will, Pip,\" he retorted, with a frowning smile. \"She has\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\npresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\nhands on such food as she takes.\"\n\"Pray, sir,\" said I, \"may I ask you a question?\"\n\"You may,\" said he, \"and I may decline to answer it. Put your\nquestion.\"\n\"Estella's name. Is it Havisham or\u2014?\" I had nothing to add.\n\"Or what?\" said he.\n\"Is it Havisham?\"\n\"It is Havisham.\"\nThis brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\nus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green\nand yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\nmaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\nwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\ntime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\nguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\ntwo ladies left us.\nAnything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\nroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\nhimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella's face once during\ndinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\nbut never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\nlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\nface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a\ndry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,\nhe showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\nextorted\u2014and even did extort, though I don't know how\u2014those references\nout of my innocent self.\nAnd when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that\nreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had\nnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted\nthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass\nagain, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and\ncross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had\nknown the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or\nfour times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he\nsaw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his\nhand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to\ntake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn't answer.\nI think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in\nthe danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her\ncap,\u2014which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,\u2014and\nstrewing the ground with her hair,\u2014which assuredly had never grown on\n_her_ head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss\nHavisham's room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss\nHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels\nfrom her dressing-table into Estella's hair, and about her bosom and\narms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\neyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.\n[Illustration]\nOf the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the\nglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor,\nof the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in\nthe light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out\nlong ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his\ncold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I\ncould never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never\nbear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear\nto see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be\nwithin a foot or two of him,\u2014it was, that my feelings should be in the\nsame place with him,\u2014_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.\nWe played until nine o'clock, and then it was arranged that when\nEstella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should\nmeet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her\nand left her.\nMy guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the\nnight, Miss Havisham's words, \"Love her, love her, love her!\" sounded\nin my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my\npillow, \"I love her, I love her, I love her!\" hundreds of times. Then,\na burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me,\nonce the blacksmith's boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by\nno means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she\nbegin to be interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her\nthat was mute and sleeping now?\nAh me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never\nthought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe,\nbecause I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone,",

I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar\nimmediately after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of\nmiles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook's premises, I\ngot round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and\nfelt myself in comparative security.",

I'm so frightened!\" feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and\ncontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed\nhim, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of\nextreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.\nThis was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced\nanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,\nand indignation, I again beheld Trabb's boy approaching. He was coming\nround a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest\nindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb's with\ncheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became\naware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his\nmotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees\nmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His\nsufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,\nand I felt utterly confounded.\nI had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when\nI again beheld Trabb's boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he\nwas entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my\ngreat-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the\nopposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young\nfriends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his\nhand, \"Don't know yah!\" Words cannot state the amount of aggravation\nand injury wreaked upon me by Trabb's boy, when passing abreast of me,\nhe pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm\nakimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,\nand drawling to his attendants, \"Don't know yah, don't know yah, 'pon\nmy soul don't know yah!\" The disgrace attendant on his immediately\nafterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with\ncrows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was\na blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and\nwas, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.",

The late king of the country not only appeared to have been\ntroubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it\nwith him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom\nalso carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had\nthe appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of\nanxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were\nsuggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led\nto the Shade's being advised by the gallery to \"turn over!\"\u2014a\nrecommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted\nof this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of\nhaving been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it\nperceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its\nterrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom\nlady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public\nto have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem\nby a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her\nwaist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so\nthat she was openly mentioned as \"the kettle-drum.\" The noble boy in\nthe ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were\nin one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a\nclergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court\nfencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice\ndiscrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a\nwant of toleration for him, and even\u2014on his being detected in holy\norders, and declining to perform the funeral service\u2014to the general\nindignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such\nslow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off\nher white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who\nhad been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the\nfront row of the gallery, growled, \"Now the baby's put to bed let's\nhave supper!\" Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.",

The last Hamlet as I dressed,\nmade the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to\nput a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal\n(which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and\nwhenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out \"I don't\nsee no wafers!\" And at night his reading was lovely.\"\nMr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say \"a faithful\nDependent\u2014I overlook his folly;\" and then said aloud, \"My view is a\nlittle classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,\nthey will improve.\"\nHerbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.\n\"Did you observe, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Waldengarver, \"that there was a\nman in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service,\u2014I\nmean, the representation?\"\nWe basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I\nadded, \"He was drunk, no doubt.\"",

      "text": "Mr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by\nthe information I had received, accepted his offer.\nWe were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge\nwhere some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison\nrules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much\nneglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all\npublic wrongdoing\u2014and which is always its heaviest and longest\npunishment\u2014was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better\nthan soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their\nprisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their\nsoup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was\ngoing his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards,\nwere buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly,\ndisorderly, depressing scene it was.\nIt struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener\nmight walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his\nseeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, \"What,\nCaptain Tom? Are _you_ there? Ah, indeed!\" and also, \"Is that Black\nBill behind the cistern? Why I didn't look for you these two months;\nhow do you find yourself?\" Equally in his stopping at the bars and\nattending to anxious whisperers,\u2014always singly,\u2014Wemmick with his\npost-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference,\nas if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made,\nsince last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.\nHe was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department\nof Mr. Jaggers's business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers\nhung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His\npersonal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,\nand in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both\nhands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in\nhis pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting\nthe raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible\nfrom the insufficient money produced, said, \"it's no use, my boy. I'm\nonly a subordinate. I can't take it. Don't go on in that way with a\nsubordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had\nbetter address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals\nin the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one,\nmay be worth the while of another; that's my recommendation to you,\nspeaking as a subordinate. Don't try on useless measures. Why should\nyou? Now, who's next?\"\nThus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until he turned to me and\nsaid, \"Notice the man I shall shake hands with.\" I should have done so,\nwithout the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.\nAlmost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see\nnow, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with a\npeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that\nwent wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of\nthe bars, and put his hand to his hat\u2014which had a greasy and fatty\nsurface like cold broth\u2014with a half-serious and half-jocose military\nsalute.\n\"Colonel, to you!\" said Wemmick; \"how are you, Colonel?\"\n\"All right, Mr. Wemmick.\"\n\"Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too\nstrong for us, Colonel.\"\n\"Yes, it was too strong, sir,\u2014but _I_ don't care.\"\n\"No, no,\" said Wemmick, coolly, \"_you_ don't care.\" Then, turning to\nme, \"Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought\nhis discharge.\"\nI said, \"Indeed?\" and the man's eyes looked at me, and then looked over\nmy head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across\nhis lips and laughed.\n\"I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,\" he said to Wemmick.\n\"Perhaps,\" returned my friend, \"but there's no knowing.\"\n\"I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,\"\nsaid the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.\n\"Thankye,\" said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. \"Same to you,\nColonel.\"\n\"If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,\" said the\nman, unwilling to let his hand go, \"I should have asked the favour of\nyour wearing another ring\u2014in acknowledgment of your attentions.\"\n\"I'll accept the will for the deed,\" said Wemmick. \"By the by; you were\nquite a pigeon-fancier.\" The man looked up at the sky. \"I am told you\nhad a remarkable breed of tumblers. _Could_ you commission any friend\nof yours to bring me a pair, if you've no further use for 'em?\"\n\"It shall be done, sir.\"\n\"All right,\" said Wemmick, \"they shall be taken care of.\nGood-afternoon, Colonel. Good-bye!\" They shook hands again, and as we\nwalked away Wemmick said to me, \"A Coiner, a very good workman. The\nRecorder's report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on\nMonday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are\nportable property all the same.\" With that, he looked back, and nodded\nat this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of\nthe yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its\nplace.",

Her manner was\nmore winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I\nthought I saw Miss Havisham's influence in the change.\nWe stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and\nwhen it was all collected I remembered\u2014having forgotten everything but\nherself in the meanwhile\u2014that I knew nothing of her destination.\n\"I am going to Richmond,\" she told me. \"Our lesson is, that there are\ntwo Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the\nSurrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage,\nand you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges\nout of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I,\nbut to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own\ndevices, you and I.\"\nAs she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner\nmeaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with\ndispleasure.\n\"A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a\nlittle?\"\n\"Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you\nare to take care of me the while.\"\nShe drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a\nwaiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen\nsuch a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,\nhe pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he\ncouldn't find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the\nestablishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous\narticle, considering the hole's proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,\nand somebody's pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us\ninto another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a\nscorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked\nat this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;\nwhich, proving to be merely, \"Some tea for the lady,\" sent him out of\nthe room in a very low state of mind.\nI was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong\ncombination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that\nthe coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising\nproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.\nYet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that\nwith her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all\nhappy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)\n\"Where are you going to, at Richmond?\" I asked Estella.\n\"I am going to live,\" said she, \"at a great expense, with a lady there,\nwho has the power\u2014or says she has\u2014of taking me about, and introducing\nme, and showing people to me and showing me to people.\"\n\"I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?\"\n\"Yes, I suppose so.\"\nShe answered so carelessly, that I said, \"You speak of yourself as if\nyou were some one else.\"\n\"Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,\" said Estella,\nsmiling delightfully, \"you must not expect me to go to school to _you_;\nI must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?\"\n\"I live quite pleasantly there; at least\u2014\" It appeared to me that I was\nlosing a chance.\n\"At least?\" repeated Estella.\n\"As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.\"\n\"You silly boy,\" said Estella, quite composedly, \"how can you talk such\nnonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest\nof his family?\"\n\"Very superior indeed. He is nobody's enemy\u2014\"\n\"Don't add but his own,\" interposed Estella, \"for I hate that class of\nman. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and\nspite, I have heard?\"\n\"I am sure I have every reason to say so.\"\n\"You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,\" said\nEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\ngrave and rallying, \"for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and\ninsinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,\nwrite letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment\nand the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourself\nthe hatred those people feel for you.\"\n\"They do me no harm, I hope?\"\nInstead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very\nsingular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When\nshe left off\u2014and she had not laughed languidly, but with real\nenjoyment\u2014I said, in my diffident way with her,\u2014\n\"I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\nharm.\"\n\"No, no you may be sure of that,\" said Estella. \"You may be certain\nthat I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and\nthe tortures they undergo!\" She laughed again, and even now when she\nhad told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not\ndoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I\nthought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw\nthe thought in my mind, and answered it.\n\"It is not easy for even you.\" said Estella, \"to know what satisfaction\nit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of\nthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not\nbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not\nyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed\nand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\nis soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round\nchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\nwoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\nin the night. I did.\"\nIt was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these\nremembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of\nthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.\n\"Two things I can tell you,\" said Estella. \"First, notwithstanding the\nproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your\nmind at rest that these people never will\u2014never would in a hundred\nyears\u2014impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great\nor small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\nbusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.\"\nAs she gave it to me playfully,\u2014for her darker mood had been but\nmomentary\u2014I held it and put it to my lips. \"You ridiculous boy,\" said\nEstella, \"will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the\nsame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?\"\n\"What spirit was that?\" said I.\n\"I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and\nplotters.\"\n\"If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?\"\n\"You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you\nlike.\"\nI leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue's. \"Now,\" said\nEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, \"you are to take\ncare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.\"\nHer reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,\nand we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our\nintercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,\nI could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on\nagainst trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it\nalways was.\nI rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,\nbrought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of\ntea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and\nforks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek\nlittle muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron\ncover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a\nquantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof\nimpressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of\nbread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in\nwith, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a\nprolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came\nback with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I\nsteeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances\nextracted one cup of I don't know what for Estella.\nThe bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,\nand the chambermaid taken into consideration,\u2014in a word, the whole\nhouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella's\npurse much lightened,\u2014we got into our post-coach and drove away.",

      "text": "Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look\nabout him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he\nconsorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an\nalmanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I\never saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we\nundertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a\nRepublic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except\nat a certain hour of every afternoon to \"go to Lloyd's\"\u2014in observance\nof a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything\nelse in connection with Lloyd's that I could find out, except come back\nagain. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively\nmust find an opening, he would go on 'Change at a busy time, and walk\nin and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the\nassembled magnates. \"For,\" says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on\none of those special occasions, \"I find the truth to be, Handel, that\nan opening won't come to one, but one must go to it,\u2014so I have been.\"\nIf we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated\none another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond\nexpression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight\nof the Avenger's livery; which had a more expensive and a less\nremunerative appearance then than at any other time in the\nfour-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast\nbecame a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at\nbreakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, \"not\nunwholly unconnected,\" as my local paper might put it, \"with jewelery,\"\nI went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him\noff his feet,\u2014so that he was actually in the air, like a booted\nCupid,\u2014for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.\nAt certain times\u2014meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our\nhumour\u2014I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,\u2014\n\"My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.\"\n\"My dear Handel,\" Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, \"if you\nwill believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange\ncoincidence.\"\n\"Then, Herbert,\" I would respond, \"let us look into our affairs.\"\nWe always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for\nthis purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to\nconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\nI know Herbert thought so too.\nWe ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\nsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds\nmight be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the\nmark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of\nink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was\nsomething very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\nI would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in\na neat hand, the heading, \"Memorandum of Pip's debts\"; with Barnard's\nInn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet\nof paper, and write across it with similar formalities, \"Memorandum of\nHerbert's debts.\"\nEach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\nwhich had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\nburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\notherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us\nexceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to\ndistinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually\npaying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things\nseemed about equal.\nWhen we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?\nHerbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\nmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.\n\"They are mounting up, Handel,\" Herbert would say; \"upon my life, they\nare mounting up.\"\n\"Be firm, Herbert,\" I would retort, plying my own pen with great\nassiduity. \"Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare\nthem out of countenance.\"\n\"So I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance.\"\nHowever, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would\nfall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the\nplea that he had not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the\ncase might be.\n\"Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it\ndown.\"\n\"What a fellow of resource you are!\" my friend would reply, with\nadmiration. \"Really your business powers are very remarkable.\"\nI thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the\nreputation of a first-rate man of business,\u2014prompt, decisive,\nenergetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities\ndown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My\nself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.\nWhen I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,\ndocketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical\nbundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not\nmy administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into\na focus for him.",

      "text": "I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my\nbirthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from\nWemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call\nupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced\nus that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual\nflutter when I repaired to my guardian's office, a model of\npunctuality.\nIn the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and\nincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of\ntissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting\nit, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian's room. It was\nNovember, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back\nagainst the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.\n\"Well, Pip,\" said he, \"I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,\nMr. Pip.\"\nWe shook hands,\u2014he was always a remarkably short shaker,\u2014and I thanked\nhim.\n\"Take a chair, Mr. Pip,\" said my guardian.\nAs I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\nboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time\nwhen I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the\nshelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were\nmaking a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\n\"Now my young friend,\" my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\nbox, \"I am going to have a word or two with you.\"\n\"If you please, sir.\"\n\"What do you suppose,\" said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\nground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,\u2014\"what\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate of?\"\n\"At the rate of, sir?\"\n\"At,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\n\"the\u2014rate\u2014of?\" And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\npocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\nI had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\nany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\nI confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\nseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, \"I thought so!\" and blew his\nnose with an air of satisfaction.\n\"Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Have you anything to ask _me_?\"\n\"Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\nquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.\"\n\"Ask one,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?\"\n\"No. Ask another.\"\n\"Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?\"\n\"Waive that, a moment,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"and ask another.\"\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\nthe inquiry, \"Have-I\u2014anything to receive, sir?\" On that, Mr. Jaggers\nsaid, triumphantly, \"I thought we should come to it!\" and called to\nWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it\nin, and disappeared.\n\"Now, Mr. Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"attend, if you please. You have been\ndrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's\ncash-book; but you are in debt, of course?\"\n\"I am afraid I must say yes, sir.\"\n\"You know you must say yes; don't you?\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"I don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did\nknow, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,\"\ncried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of\nprotesting: \"it's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but you\nwould. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\npiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\nand tell me what it is.\"\n\"This is a bank-note,\" said I, \"for five hundred pounds.\"\n\"That is a bank-note,\" repeated Mr. Jaggers, \"for five hundred pounds.\nAnd a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?\"\n\"How could I do otherwise!\"\n\"Ah! But answer the question,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\"You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\nhandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\nday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\nsum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until\nthe donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your\nmoney affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from\nWemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are\nin communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\nagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\ninstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\nI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.\"\nI was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\nliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. \"I am\nnot paid, Pip,\" said he, coolly, \"to carry your words to any one;\" and\nthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\nhim.",

He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office\ncandlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near\nthe door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his\nhat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest\nwith his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.\n\"Mr. Wemmick,\" said I, \"I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\nto serve a friend.\"\nWemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\n\"This friend,\" I pursued, \"is trying to get on in commercial life, but\nhas no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\nbeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.\"\n\"With money down?\" said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\n\"With _some_ money down,\" I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot\nacross me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home\u2014\"with _some_\nmoney down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" said Wemmick, \"I should like just to run over with you on my\nfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as\nChelsea Reach. Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two;\nBlackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.\"\nHe had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\nsafe-key on the palm of his hand. \"There's as many as six, you see, to\nchoose from.\"\n\"I don't understand you,\" said I.\n\"Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,\" returned Wemmick, \"and take a walk upon\nyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\nof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\nyou may know the end of it too,\u2014but it's a less pleasant and profitable\nend.\"\nI could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\nsaying this.\n\"This is very discouraging,\" said I.\n\"Meant to be so,\" said Wemmick.\n\"Then is it your opinion,\" I inquired, with some little indignation,\n\"that a man should never\u2014\"\n\"\u2014Invest portable property in a friend?\" said Wemmick. \"Certainly he\nshould not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,\u2014and then it\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get\nrid of him.\"\n\"And that,\" said I, \"is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?\"\n\"That,\" he returned, \"is my deliberate opinion in this office.\"\n\"Ah!\" said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\nhere; \"but would that be your opinion at Walworth?\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" he replied, with gravity, \"Walworth is one place, and this\noffice is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is\nanother. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments\nmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken\nin this office.\"\n\"Very well,\" said I, much relieved, \"then I shall look you up at\nWalworth, you may depend upon it.\"\n\"Mr. Pip,\" he returned, \"you will be welcome there, in a private and\npersonal capacity.\"\nWe had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my\nguardian's ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in\nhis doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and\nstood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street\ntogether, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr.\nJaggers and I turned ours.",

On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union\nJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of\ndefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most\npacific manner by the Aged.\n\"My son, sir,\" said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, \"rather\nhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word\nthat he would soon be home from his afternoon's walk. He is very\nregular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my\nson.\"\nI nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside.\n\"You made acquaintance with my son, sir,\" said the old man, in his\nchirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, \"at his office, I\nexpect?\" I nodded. \"Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand\nat his business, sir?\" I nodded hard. \"Yes; so they tell me. His\nbusiness is the Law?\" I nodded harder. \"Which makes it more surprising\nin my son,\" said the old man, \"for he was not brought up to the Law,\nbut to the Wine-Coopering.\"\nCurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\nreputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\nsprightly manner, \"No, to be sure; you're right.\" And to this hour I\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\nhad made.\nAs I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\nsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his\nown calling in life had been \"the Wine-Coopering.\" By dint of straining\nthat term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on\nthe chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my\nmeaning understood.\n\"No,\" said the old gentleman; \"the warehousing, the warehousing. First,\nover yonder;\" he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\nintended to refer me to Liverpool; \"and then in the City of London\nhere. However, having an infirmity\u2014for I am hard of hearing, sir\u2014\"\nI expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\n\"\u2014Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\nwent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and\nlittle made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to\nwhat you said, you know,\" pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,\n\"what I say is, No to be sure; you're right.\"\nI was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\nimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\non one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\nwooden flap with \"JOHN\" upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\nwith great triumph, \"My son's come home!\" and we both went out to the\ndrawbridge.\nIt was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the\nother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with\nthe greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,\nthat I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had\ncome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he\nwas accompanied.",

Thinking that he\ndid this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I\nseized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\nHaving thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\nhad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\nbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\nwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert's home, and at his character, and\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\nthose, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\nconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\nhave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\nin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the\npossibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the\ncertainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any\nmean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told\nWemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a\ngreat affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some\nrays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience\nand knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my\nresources to help Herbert to some present income,\u2014say of a hundred a\nyear, to keep him in good hope and heart,\u2014and gradually to buy him on\nto some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to\nunderstand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert's\nknowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world\nwith whom I could advise.

We are all attention,\nAged One.\"\n\"All right, John, all right!\" returned the cheerful old man, so busy\nand so pleased, that it really was quite charming.\nThe Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle's\ngreat-aunt's, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\nthrough a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\nthem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\nquite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all\nexpressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\nresumed again.\nAs Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a\nshadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.\nWemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually\nstealing his arm round Miss Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw\nhis hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment\nMiss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm\nagain as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest\ndeliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins's composure\nwhile she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever\nseen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction\nof mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it\nmechanically.\nBy and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and\ngradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\nwiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\nenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\nof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\nof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\nit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading,\nWemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled\nto it by Miss Skiffins.",

Of course I knew better than to offer\nto see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had\nbest go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and\nhaving passed a pleasant evening.\nBefore a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,\nstating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter\nappertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would\nbe glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to\nWalworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by\nappointment in the City several times, but never held any communication\nwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that\nwe found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long\nestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted\ncapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a\npartner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which\nHerbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds\ndown, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at\ncertain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my\nproperty.

I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me\nwhile the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost\nbetween us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when\nhe called upon the company to pledge him to \"Estella!\"\n\"Estella who?\" said I.\n\"Never you mind,\" retorted Drummle.\n\"Estella of where?\" said I. \"You are bound to say of where.\" Which he\nwas, as a Finch.\n\"Of Richmond, gentlemen,\" said Drummle, putting me out of the question,\n\"and a peerless beauty.\"\nMuch he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I\nwhispered Herbert.\n\"I know that lady,\" said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had\nbeen honoured.\n\"_Do_ you?\" said Drummle.\n\"And so do I,\" I added, with a scarlet face.\n\"_Do_ you?\" said Drummle. \"_O_, Lord!\"\nThis was the only retort\u2014except glass or crockery\u2014that the heavy\ncreature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it\nas if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place\nand said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable\nFinch's impudence to come down to that Grove,\u2014we always talked about\ncoming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of\nexpression,\u2014down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew\nnothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by\nthat? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew\nwhere I was to be found.\nWhether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,\nafter this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The\ndebate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more\nhonourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they\nbelieved _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it was\ndecided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle\nwould bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that\nhe had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,\nas a gentleman and a Finch, for \"having been betrayed into a warmth\nwhich.\" Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honour\nshould take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a\npolite little avowal in Estella's hand, that she had had the honour of\ndancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret\nthat I had been \"betrayed into a warmth which,\" and on the whole to\nrepudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.\nDrummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the\nGrove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the\npromotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing\nrate.",

I took the\nnext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to\ntake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I\nwas with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such\nplaces.\n\"Are you tired, Estella?\"\n\"Rather, Pip.\"\n\"You should be.\"\n\"Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to\nwrite, before I go to sleep.\"\n\"Recounting to-night's triumph?\" said I. \"Surely a very poor one,\nEstella.\"\n\"What do you mean? I didn't know there had been any.\"\n\"Estella,\" said I, \"do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is\nlooking over here at us.\"\n\"Why should I look at him?\" returned Estella, with her eyes on me\ninstead. \"What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,\u2014to use\nyour words,\u2014that I need look at?\"\n\"Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,\" said I. \"For he\nhas been hovering about you all night.\"\n\"Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,\" replied Estella, with a\nglance towards him, \"hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help\nit?\"\n\"No,\" I returned; \"but cannot the Estella help it?\"\n\"Well!\" said she, laughing, after a moment, \"perhaps. Yes. Anything you\nlike.\"\n\"But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should\nencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is\ndespised.\"\n\"Well?\" said she.\n\"You know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,\nill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.\"\n\"Well?\" said she.\n\"You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\nroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?\"\n\"Well?\" said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her\nlovely eyes the wider.\nTo overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\nfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, \"Well! Then, that is\nwhy it makes me wretched.\"\nNow, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea\nof making me\u2014me\u2014wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;\nbut in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the\nquestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.\n\"Pip,\" said Estella, casting her glance over the room, \"don't be\nfoolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and\nmay be meant to have. It's not worth discussing.\"\n\"Yes it is,\" said I, \"because I cannot bear that people should say,\n'she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest\nin the crowd.'\"\n\"I can bear it,\" said Estella.\n\"Oh! don't be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.\"\n\"Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!\" said Estella, opening\nher hands. \"And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\nboor!\"\n\"There is no doubt you do,\" said I, something hurriedly, \"for I have\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never\ngive to\u2014me.\"\n\"Do you want me then,\" said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and\nserious, if not angry, look, \"to deceive and entrap you?\"\n\"Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?\"\n\"Yes, and many others,\u2014all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I'll\nsay no more.\"\nAnd now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled",

I ain't a-going to be low.\"\n\"First,\" I resumed, half groaning, \"what precautions can be taken\nagainst your being recognised and seized?\"\n\"No, dear boy,\" he said, in the same tone as before, \"that don't go\nfirst. Lowness goes first. I ain't took so many year to make a\ngentleman, not without knowing what's due to him. Look'ee here, Pip. I\nwas low; that's what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.\"\nSome sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I\nreplied, \"I _have_ looked over it. In Heaven's name, don't harp upon\nit!\"\n\"Yes, but look'ee here,\" he persisted. \"Dear boy, I ain't come so fur,\nnot fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying\u2014\"\n\"How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?\"\n\"Well, dear boy, the danger ain't so great. Without I was informed\nagen, the danger ain't so much to signify. There's Jaggers, and there's\nWemmick, and there's you. Who else is there to inform?\"\n\"Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?\" said\nI.\n\"Well,\" he returned, \"there ain't many. Nor yet I don't intend to\nadvertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from\nBotany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who's to gain by it? Still,\nlook'ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I\nshould ha' come to see you, mind you, just the same.\"\n\"And how long do you remain?\"\n\"How long?\" said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping\nhis jaw as he stared at me. \"I'm not a-going back. I've come for good.\"\n\"Where are you to live?\" said I. \"What is to be done with you? Where\nwill you be safe?\"\n\"Dear boy,\" he returned, \"there's disguising wigs can be bought for\nmoney, and there's hair powder, and spectacles, and black\nclothes,\u2014shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what\nothers has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of\nliving, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.\"\n\"You take it smoothly now,\" said I, \"but you were very serious last\nnight, when you swore it was Death.\"\n\"And so I swear it is Death,\" said he, putting his pipe back in his\nmouth, \"and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this,\nand it's serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What\nthen, when that's once done? Here I am. To go back now 'ud be as bad as\nto stand ground\u2014worse. Besides, Pip, I'm here, because I've meant it by\nyou, years and years. As to what I dare, I'm a old bird now, as has\ndared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I'm not\nafeerd to perch upon a scarecrow. If there's Death hid inside of it,\nthere is, and let him come out, and I'll face him, and then I'll\nbelieve in him and not afore. And now let me have a look at my\ngentleman agen.\"\nOnce more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of\nadmiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.\nIt appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet\nlodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert\nreturned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must be\nconfided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I\ncould have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with\nhim out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so\nplain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved\nhis consent to Herbert's participation until he should have seen him\nand formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy. \"And even then,\ndear boy,\" said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out\nof his pocket, \"we'll have him on his oath.\"\nTo state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about\nthe world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to\nstate what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never\nknew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of\nhaving been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his\nknowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that\nwise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or\ncharm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he\nhad made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had\ndescribed himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in\nhis solitude.\nAs he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he\nlooked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next\ndiscussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an\nextraordinary belief in the virtues of \"shorts\" as a disguise, and had\nin his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him\nsomething between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable\ndifficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a\nprosperous farmer's; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,\nand wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the\nlaundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until\nhis change of dress was made.",

Mr. Jaggers was at his\ndesk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before his\nfire.\n\"Now, Pip,\" said he, \"be careful.\"\n\"I will, sir,\" I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what\nI was going to say.\n\"Don't commit yourself,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"and don't commit any one.\nYou understand\u2014any one. Don't tell me anything: I don't want to know\nanything; I am not curious.\"\nOf course I saw that he knew the man was come.\n\"I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,\" said I, \"to assure myself that what I\nhave been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at\nleast I may verify it.\"\nMr. Jaggers nodded. \"But did you say 'told' or 'informed'?\" he asked\nme, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in a\nlistening way at the floor. \"Told would seem to imply verbal\ncommunication. You can't have verbal communication with a man in New\nSouth Wales, you know.\"\n\"I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.\"\n\"Good.\"\n\"I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the\nbenefactor so long unknown to me.\"\n\"That is the man,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"in New South Wales.\"\n\"And only he?\" said I.\n\"And only he,\" said Mr. Jaggers.\n\"I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for\nmy mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss\nHavisham.\"\n\"As you say, Pip,\" returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon me\ncoolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, \"I am not at all\nresponsible for that.\"\n\"And yet it looked so like it, sir,\" I pleaded with a downcast heart.\n\"Not a particle of evidence, Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head\nand gathering up his skirts. \"Take nothing on its looks; take\neverything on evidence. There's no better rule.\"\n\"I have no more to say,\" said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for\na little while. \"I have verified my information, and there's an end.\"\n\"And Magwitch\u2014in New South Wales\u2014having at last disclosed himself,\"\nsaid Mr. Jaggers, \"you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my\ncommunication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of\nfact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of\nfact. You are quite aware of that?\"\n\"Quite, sir.\"\n\"I communicated to Magwitch\u2014in New South Wales\u2014when he first wrote to\nme\u2014from New South Wales\u2014the caution that he must not expect me ever to\ndeviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him\nanother caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his\nletter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I\ncautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all\nlikely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his\nnatural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be\nan act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the\nlaw. I gave Magwitch that caution,\" said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at\nme; \"I wrote it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.\"\n\"No doubt,\" said I.\n\"I have been informed by Wemmick,\" pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking\nhard at me, \"that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from\na colonist of the name of Purvis, or\u2014\"\n\"Or Provis,\" I suggested.\n\"Or Provis\u2014thank you, Pip. Perhaps it _is_ Provis? Perhaps you know\nit's Provis?\"\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\"You know it's Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist\nof the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on\nbehalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by\nreturn of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received\nthe explanation of Magwitch\u2014in New South Wales?\"\n\"It came through Provis,\" I replied.\n\"Good day, Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; \"glad to have\nseen you. In writing by post to Magwitch\u2014in New South Wales\u2014or in\ncommunicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention\nthat the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to\nyou, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.\nGood-day, Pip!\"\nWe shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I\nturned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two\nvile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,\nand to force out of their swollen throats, \"O, what a man he is!\"",

Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\nputting himself in the way of being taken.\"\n\"Then you may rely upon it,\" said Herbert, \"that there would be great\ndanger of his doing it.

But to give it you short and handy, I'll\nput it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in\njail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you've got it.\nThat's _my_ life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,\narter Pip stood my friend.\n\"I've been done everything to, pretty well\u2014except hanged. I've been\nlocked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I've been carted here and\ncarted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and\nstuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I've no more\nnotion where I was born than you have\u2014if so much. I first become aware\nof myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had\nrun away from me\u2014a man\u2014a tinker\u2014and he'd took the fire with him, and\nleft me wery cold.\n\"I know'd my name to be Magwitch, chrisen'd Abel. How did I know it?\nMuch as I know'd the birds' names in the hedges to be chaffinch,\nsparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as\nthe birds' names come out true, I supposed mine did.\n\"So fur as I could find, there warn't a soul that see young Abel\nMagwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at\nhim, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up,\ntook up, to that extent that I reg'larly grow'd up took up.\n\"This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as\nmuch to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for\nthere warn't many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the\nname of being hardened. 'This is a terrible hardened one,' they says to\nprison wisitors, picking out me. 'May be said to live in jails, this\nboy.' Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured\nmy head, some on 'em,\u2014they had better a measured my stomach,\u2014and others\non 'em giv me tracts what I couldn't read, and made me speeches what I\ncouldn't understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But\nwhat the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach,\nmustn't I?\u2014Howsomever, I'm a getting low, and I know what's due. Dear\nboy and Pip's comrade, don't you be afeerd of me being low.\n\"Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,\u2014though\nthat warn't as often as you may think, till you put the question\nwhether you would ha' been over-ready to give me work yourselves,\u2014a bit\nof a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a\nhaymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don't pay and\nlead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a\nTraveller's Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs,\nlearnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a\npenny a time learnt me to write. I warn't locked up as often now as\nformerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.\n\"At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted\nwi' a man whose skull I'd crack wi' this poker, like the claw of a\nlobster, if I'd got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and\nthat's the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch,\naccording to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last\nnight.\n\"He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he'd been to a public\nboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was\na dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the\nnight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth\nthat I know'd on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when\nI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a\nsporting one) called him out, and said, 'I think this is a man that\nmight suit you,'\u2014meaning I was.\n\"Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a\nwatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of\nclothes.\n\"'To judge from appearances, you're out of luck,' says Compeyson to me.\n\"'Yes, master, and I've never been in it much.' (I had come out of\nKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have\nbeen for something else; but it warn't.)\n\"'Luck changes,' says Compeyson; 'perhaps yours is going to change.'\n\"I says, 'I hope it may be so. There's room.'\n\"'What can you do?' says Compeyson.\n\"'Eat and drink,' I says; 'if you'll find the materials.'\n\"Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five\nshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\n\"I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on\nto be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson's business in which\nwe was to go pardners? Compeyson's business was the swindling,\nhandwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts\nof traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs\nout of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was\nCompeyson's business. He'd no more heart than a iron file, he was as\ncold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.\n\"There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,\u2014not as\nbeing so chrisen'd, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a\nshadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a\nrich lady some years afore, and they'd made a pot of money by it; but\nCompeyson betted and gamed, and he'd have run through the king's taxes.\nSo, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,\nand Compeyson's wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity\non him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and\nnobody.\n\"I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn't; and I won't pretend I\nwas partick'ler\u2014for where 'ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?\nSo I begun wi' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur\nlived at the top of Compeyson's house (over nigh Brentford it was), and\nCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in\ncase he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled\nthe account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a\ntearing down into Compeyson's parlour late at night, in only a flannel\ngown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson's wife,\n'Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can't get rid of\nher. She's all in white,' he says, 'wi' white flowers in her hair, and\nshe's awful mad, and she's got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she\nsays she'll put it on me at five in the morning.'\n\"Says Compeyson: 'Why, you fool, don't you know she's got a living\nbody? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door,\nor in at the window, and up the stairs?'\n\"'I don't know how she's there,' says Arthur, shivering dreadful with\nthe horrors, 'but she's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,\nawful mad. And over where her heart's broke\u2014_you_ broke it!\u2014there's\ndrops of blood.'\n\"Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. 'Go up alonger this\ndrivelling sick man,' he says to his wife, 'and Magwitch, lend her a\nhand, will you?' But he never come nigh himself.\n\"Compeyson's wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most\ndreadful. 'Why look at her!' he cries out. 'She's a shaking the shroud\nat me! Don't you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain't it awful to see her\nso mad?' Next he cries, 'She'll put it on me, and then I'm done for!\nTake it away from her, take it away!' And then he catched hold of us,\nand kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed\nI see her myself.\n\"Compeyson's wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the\nhorrors off, and by and by he quieted. 'O, she's gone! Has her keeper\nbeen for her?' he says. 'Yes,' says Compeyson's wife. 'Did you tell him\nto lock her and bar her in?' 'Yes.' 'And to take that ugly thing away\nfrom her?' 'Yes, yes, all right.' 'You're a good creetur,' he says,\n'don't leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!'\n\"He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and\nthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, 'Here she is! She's\ngot the shroud again. She's unfolding it. She's coming out of the\ncorner. She's coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you\u2014one of each\nside\u2014don't let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.\nDon't let her throw it over my shoulders. Don't let her lift me up to\nget it round me. She's lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he lifted\nhimself up hard, and was dead.\n\"Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and me\nwas soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own\nbook,\u2014this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade\non.\n\"Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done\u2014which 'ud\ntake a week\u2014I'll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip's comrade, that\nthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always\nin debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a\ngetting into danger. He was younger than me, but he'd got craft, and\nhe'd got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no\nmercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi'\u2014Stop though!

Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for\nmisdemeanor, while with Compeyson?\"\nI answered, No.\n\"Well!\" he said, \"I _was_, and got convicted. As to took up on\nsuspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that\nit lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both\ncommitted for felony,\u2014on a charge of putting stolen notes in\ncirculation,\u2014and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me,\n'Separate defences, no communication,' and that was all. And I was so\nmiserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on\nmy back, afore I could get Jaggers.\n\"When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman\nCompeyson looked, wi' his curly hair and his black clothes and his\nwhite pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.\nWhen the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand,\nI noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the\nevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had\ncome for'ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the\nmoney had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work\nthe thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see\nthe plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, 'My lord and\ngentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your\neyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be\nspoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to\nas such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here\ntransactions, and only suspected; t'other, the elder, always seen in\n'em and always wi' his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is\nbut one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is\nmuch the worst one?' And such-like. And when it come to character,\nwarn't it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn't it his\nschoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn't it him as\nhad been know'd by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to\nhis disadvantage? And warn't it me as had been tried afore, and as had\nbeen know'd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when\nit come to speech-making, warn't it Compeyson as could speak to 'em wi'\nhis face dropping every now and then into his white\npocket-handkercher,\u2014ah! and wi' verses in his speech, too,\u2014and warn't\nit me as could only say, 'Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most\nprecious rascal'? And when the verdict come, warn't it Compeyson as was\nrecommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and\ngiving up all the information he could agen me, and warn't it me as got\nnever a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, 'Once out of\nthis court, I'll smash that face of yourn!' ain't it Compeyson as prays\nthe Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And\nwhen we're sentenced, ain't it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,\nand ain't it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so\nwell, and ain't it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of\nwiolent passion, likely to come to worse?\"",

      "text": "Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise\nto go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe\nor his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and\nHerbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be\nabsent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his\nimpatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be\nbegun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert\nalso, that he might be best got away across the water, on that\npretence,\u2014as, to make purchases, or the like.\nHaving thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham's, I set\noff by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out on\nthe open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and\nwhimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of\nmist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly\nride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,\nto look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!\nAs he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a\nvery lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into\nthe coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I\nordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very\nwell knew why he had come there.\nPretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had\nnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of\ncoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which\nit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly\nirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\nfire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my\nhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to\nstir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.\n\"Is this a cut?\" said Mr. Drummle.\n\"Oh!\" said I, poker in hand; \"it's you, is it? How do you do? I was\nwondering who it was, who kept the fire off.\"\nWith that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself\nside by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the\nfire.\n\"You have just come down?\" said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away\nwith his shoulder.\n\"Yes,\" said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.\n\"Beastly place,\" said Drummle. \"Your part of the country, I think?\"\n\"Yes,\" I assented. \"I am told it's very like your Shropshire.\"\n\"Not in the least like it,\" said Drummle.\nHere Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.\nDrummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.\n\"Have you been here long?\" I asked, determined not to yield an inch of\nthe fire.\n\"Long enough to be tired of it,\" returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,\nbut equally determined.\n\"Do you stay here long?\"\n\"Can't say,\" answered Mr. Drummle. \"Do you?\"\n\"Can't say,\" said I.\nI felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle's\nshoulder had claimed another hair's breadth of room, I should have\njerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged\na similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.\nHe whistled a little. So did I.\n\"Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?\" said Drummle.\n\"Yes. What of that?\" said I.\nMr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, \"Oh!\"\nand laughed.\n\"Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?\"\n\"No,\" said he, \"not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the\nsaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way\nvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses\u2014and\nsmithies\u2014and that. Waiter!\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Is that horse of mine ready?\"\n\"Brought round to the door, sir.\"\n\"I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won't ride to-day; the weather\nwon't do.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\"And I don't dine, because I'm going to dine at the lady's.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\nThen, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\ngreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\nexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\nrobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\nhim on the fire.\nOne thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\ncame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\nsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\nhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\nthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle's\nwas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\nstood our ground.\n\"Have you been to the Grove since?\" said Drummle.\n\"No,\" said I, \"I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was\nthere.\"\n\"Was that when we had a difference of opinion?\"\n\"Yes,\" I replied, very shortly.\n\"Come, come! They let you off easily enough,\" sneered Drummle. \"You\nshouldn't have lost your temper.\"\n\"Mr. Drummle,\" said I, \"you are not competent to give advice on that\nsubject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that\noccasion), I don't throw glasses.\"\n\"I do,\" said Drummle.\nAfter glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of\nsmouldering ferocity, I said,\u2014\n\"Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don't think it an\nagreeable one.\"\n\"I am sure it's not,\" said he, superciliously over his shoulder; \"I\ndon't think anything about it.\"\n\"And therefore,\" I went on, \"with your leave, I will suggest that we\nhold no kind of communication in future.\"\n\"Quite my opinion,\" said Drummle, \"and what I should have suggested\nmyself, or done\u2014more likely\u2014without suggesting. But don't lose your\ntemper. Haven't you lost enough without that?\"\n\"What do you mean, sir?\"\n\"Waiter!\" said Drummle, by way of answering me.\nThe waiter reappeared.\n\"Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don't\nride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady's?\"\n\"Quite so, sir!\"\nWhen the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his\nhand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,\ncareful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket\nand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and\nboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without\nintroducing Estella's name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;\nand therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were\nno one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have\nremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for\nthe incursion of three thriving farmers\u2014laid on by the waiter, I\nthink\u2014who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and\nrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we\nwere obliged to give way.\nI saw him through the window, seizing his horse's mane, and mounting in\nhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought\nhe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in\nhis mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-coloured dress\nappeared with what was wanted,\u2014I could not have said from where:\nwhether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,\u2014and as Drummle\nleaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a\njerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching\nshoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me\nreminded me of Orlick.\nToo heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\nno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the\njourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house",

      "text": "In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles\nburnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham\nseated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.\nEstella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both\nraised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I\nderived that, from the look they interchanged.\n\"And what wind,\" said Miss Havisham, \"blows you here, Pip?\"\nThough she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.\nEstella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and\nthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as\nplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived\nI had discovered my real benefactor.\n\"Miss Havisham,\" said I, \"I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to\nEstella; and finding that some wind had blown _her_ here, I followed.\"\nMiss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,\nI took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her\noccupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural\nplace for me, that day.\n\"What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,\npresently\u2014in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not\ndisplease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.\"\nMiss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the\naction of Estella's fingers as they worked that she attended to what I\nsaid; but she did not look up.\n\"I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,\nand is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,\nanything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not\nmy secret, but another's.\"\nAs I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to\ngo on, Miss Havisham repeated, \"It is not your secret, but another's.\nWell?\"\n\"When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I\nbelonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I\nsuppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have\ncome,\u2014as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid\nfor it?\"\n\"Ay, Pip,\" replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; \"you did.\"\n\"And that Mr. Jaggers\u2014\"\n\"Mr. Jaggers,\" said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, \"had\nnothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and\nhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same\nrelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that\nas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.\"\nAny one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\nsuppression or evasion so far.\n\"But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least\nyou led me on?\" said I.\n\"Yes,\" she returned, again nodding steadily, \"I let you go on.\"\n\"Was that kind?\"\n\"Who am I,\" cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and\nflashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in\nsurprise,\u2014\"who am I, for God's sake, that I should be kind?\"\nIt was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I\ntold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.\n\"Well, well, well!\" she said. \"What else?\"\n\"I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,\" I said, to soothe\nher, \"in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for\nmy own information. What follows has another (and I hope more\ndisinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you\npunished\u2014practised on\u2014perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\nyour intention, without offence\u2014your self-seeking relations?\"\n\"I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my\nhistory, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\nnot to have it so! You made your own snares. _I_ never made them.\"\nWaiting until she was quiet again,\u2014for this, too, flashed out of her in\na wild and sudden way,\u2014I went on.\n\"I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,\nand have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them\nto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be\nfalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you\nor no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that\nyou deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you\nsuppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and\nincapable of anything designing or mean.\"\n\"They are your friends,\" said Miss Havisham.\n\"They made themselves my friends,\" said I, \"when they supposed me to\nhave superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and\nMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.\"\nThis contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do\nthem good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and\nthen said quietly,\u2014\n\"What do you want for them?\"\n\"Only,\" said I, \"that you would not confound them with the others. They\nmay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same\nnature.\"\nStill looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,\u2014\n\"What do you want for them?\"\n\"I am not so cunning, you see,\" I said, in answer, conscious that I\nreddened a little, \"as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,\nthat I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money\nto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the\nnature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you\nhow.\"\n\"Why must it be done without his knowledge?\" she asked, settling her\nhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.\n\"Because,\" said I, \"I began the service myself, more than two years\nago, without his knowledge, and I don't want to be betrayed. Why I fail\nin my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the\nsecret which is another person's and not mine.\"\nShe gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.\nAfter watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of\nthe slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the\ncollapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again\u2014at\nfirst, vacantly\u2014then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All\nthis time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her\nattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in\nour dialogue,\u2014\n\"What else?\"\n\"Estella,\" said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my\ntrembling voice, \"you know I love you. You know that I have loved you\nlong and dearly.\"\nShe raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her\nfingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved\ncountenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from\nher to me.\n\"I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me\nto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought\nyou could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.\nBut I must say it now.\"\nPreserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,\nEstella shook her head.\n\"I know,\" said I, in answer to that action,\u2014\"I know. I have no hope\nthat I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become\nof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love\nyou. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.\"\nLooking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook\nher head again.\n\"It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise\non the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all\nthese years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected\non the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that,\nin the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.\"\nI saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\nsat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\n\"It seems,\" said Estella, very calmly, \"that there are sentiments,\nfancies,\u2014I don't know how to call them,\u2014which I am not able to\ncomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\nof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\nnothing there. I don't care for what you say at all. I have tried to\nwarn you of this; now, have I not?\"\nI said in a miserable manner, \"Yes.\"\n\"Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.\nNow, did you not think so?\"\n\"I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and\nbeautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.\"\n\"It is in _my_ nature,\" she returned. And then she added, with a stress\nupon the words, \"It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\ndifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can\ndo no more.\"\n\"Is it not true,\" said I, \"that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\npursuing you?\"\n\"It is quite true,\" she replied, referring to him with the indifference\nof utter contempt.\n\"That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\nyou this very day?\"\nShe seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\n\"Quite true.\"\n\"You cannot love him, Estella!\"\nHer fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\n\"What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do\nnot mean what I say?\"\n\"You would never marry him, Estella?\"\nShe looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\nwork in her hands. Then she said, \"Why not tell you the truth? I am\ngoing to be married to him.\"\nI dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\nthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\nher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\nghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my\npassionate hurry and grief.\n\"Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\nfatal step. Put me aside for ever,\u2014you have done so, I well know,\u2014but\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\ngives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\nto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\nlove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as\ndearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can\nbear it better, for your sake!\"\nMy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\nbeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\nintelligible to her own mind.\n\"I am going,\" she said again, in a gentler voice, \"to be married to\nhim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\nmarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\nadoption? It is my own act.\"\n\"Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?\"\n\"On whom should I fling myself away?\" she retorted, with a smile.\n\"Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\npeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\ndone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading me\ninto what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\nwait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\nhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say\nno more. We shall never understand each other.\"\n\"Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!\" I urged, in despair.\n\"Don't be afraid of my being a blessing to him,\" said Estella; \"I shall\nnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\nboy\u2014or man?\"\n\"O Estella!\" I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\nwhat I would to restrain them; \"even if I remained in England and could\nhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle's wife?\"\n\"Nonsense,\" she returned,\u2014\"nonsense. This will pass in no time.\"\n\"Never, Estella!\"\n\"You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.\"\n\"Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\nhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\nin every prospect I have ever seen since,\u2014on the river, on the sails of\nthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the\ndarkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You\nhave been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever\nbecome acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London\nbuildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be\ndisplaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to\nme, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my\nlife, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the\nlittle good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I\nassociate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to\nthat always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me\nfeel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!\"\nIn what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself,\nI don't know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an\ninward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering\nmoments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,\u2014and soon\nafterwards with stronger reason,\u2014that while Estella looked at me merely\nwith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand\nstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of\npity and remorse.",

      "text": "As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,\nbefore he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those\nvirtuous days\u2014an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which\ninstantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever\nbe lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the\nbottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a\nstaringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and\nlay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more\nclose my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.\nAnd thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one\nanother.\nWhat a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an\ninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I\nlooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a\nnumber of blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the\nmarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying\nby for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever\ntumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,\u2014a\ndisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable\napproaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\naudible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little\nwashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the\nchest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired\na new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw\nwritten, DON'T GO HOME.\nWhatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never\nwarded off this DON'T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I\nthought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had\nread in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums\nin the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had\nbeen found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that\nhe must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to\nassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door\nto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship\nof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But\nall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\nand when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\nquestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I\nthought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I\nrecalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and\ntones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,\u2014even then I was\npursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don't go home.\nWhen at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a\nvast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present\ntense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do\nnot ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may\nnot and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and\nshould not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and\nrolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the\nwall again.",

But I\ntold him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to\nask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\ndeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\nbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\nnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\nonce, to put my question.\n\"You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\nCompeyson?\"\nHe answered with one other nod.\n\"Is he living?\"\nOne other nod.\n\"Is he in London?\"\nHe gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\nme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\n\"Now,\" said Wemmick, \"questioning being over,\" which he emphasised and\nrepeated for my guidance, \"I come to what I did, after hearing what I\nheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\nClarriker's to find Mr. Herbert.\"\n\"And him you found?\" said I, with great anxiety.\n\"And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\ndetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody\u2014Tom,\nJack, or Richard\u2014being about the chambers, or about the immediate\nneighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\nwhile you were out of the way.\"\n\"He would be greatly puzzled what to do?\"\n\"He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my\nopinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too\nfar out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under\nexisting circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you\nare once in it. Don't break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things\nslacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.\"\nI thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had\ndone?\n\"Mr. Herbert,\" said Wemmick, \"after being all of a heap for half an\nhour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\ncourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\nPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\nbow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\nare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?\"\n\"Not personally,\" said I.\nThe truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\nwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\npresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such very\nmoderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the\nstate of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time\nbefore I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert's\nprospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful\nphilosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not\nbeen very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;\nand thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara's esteem,\nand although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged\nmessages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I\ndid not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.\n\"The house with the bow-window,\" said Wemmick, \"being by the\nriver-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and\nbeing kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished\nupper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that\nas a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very\nwell of it, for three reasons I'll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.\nIt's altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual\nheap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near it\nyourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,\nthrough Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might be\nprudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a\nforeign packet-boat, there he is\u2014ready.\"\nMuch comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\nagain, and begged him to proceed.\n\"Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,\nand by nine o'clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or\nRichard,\u2014whichever it may be,\u2014you and I don't want to know,\u2014quite\nsuccessfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was\nsummoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and\ncornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that\nit was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself\nabout your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off\nand quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;\nand for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last",

He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his\nroom, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and\n_will_ weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler's shop.\"\nWhile he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and\nthen died away.\n\"What else can be the consequence,\" said Herbert, in explanation, \"if\nhe _will_ cut the cheese?

For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no\nrelation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.\"\n\"Surely that's not his name, Herbert?\"\n\"No, no,\" said Herbert, \"that's my name for him. His name is Mr.\nBarley. But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother\nto love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself\nor anybody else about her family!\"\nHerbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he\nfirst knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at\nan establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home to\nnurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the\nmotherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with\nequal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that\nnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by\nreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject\nmore psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser's stores.",

As to altering my way of living by\nenlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled\nand difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it\nwere no worse?\nHe could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\ncoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\nventure.

The\nwindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark\nand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the\nfountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between\nme and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedside\nwhen he came in,\u2014for I went straight to bed, dispirited and\nfatigued,\u2014made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,\nhe looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as\nsolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.\nNext day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat\nwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her\nwithin a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and\npractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in\ncold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\nout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\nhours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\nLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But\nI knew well enough how to 'shoot' the bridge after seeing it done, and\nso began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to\nErith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were\npulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the\nblind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less\nfrequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single\nword of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there\nwas cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being\nwatched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning\npersons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.\nIn short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in\nhiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to\nstand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,\nand to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards\nClara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,\nand that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going\nswiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.",

This led to Mr. Wopsle's (who had never been heard of\nbefore) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of\ngreat power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all\nto go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down\nthe Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. The\nboatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on\nthe Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your\nHonour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,\nconceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into\na dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that\ncorner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of\nme.\nThe second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in\nthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.\nWopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\ncountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in\nthe manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.\nBut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,\nthe Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,\u2014on account of\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of\nhis daughter's heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a\nflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,\u2014summoned a sententious\nEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,\nafter an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a\nhigh-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.\nThe business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked\nat, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various\ncolours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with\ngreat surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he\nwere lost in amazement.\nThere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.\nWopsle's eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\nmind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out.

Only the subject we were speaking of,\" said I, \"was rather\npainful to me.\"\nThe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood\nlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did\ngo. Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and\nsuch hands on a memorable occasion very lately!\nHe dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those\nhands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I\ncompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and\na stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\nhousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\nme when I last walked\u2014not alone\u2014in the ruined garden, and through the\ndeserted brewery.

I thought how one link of association\nhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\nwanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\nchance swift from Estella's name to the fingers with their knitting\naction, and the attentive eyes.

As to the quantity of wine,\nhis post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office\nfor its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong\ntwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.\nWe took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping\namong Mr. Jaggers's stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right\ntwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\nGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was\nwalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had\nevaporated into the evening air.\n\"Well!\" said Wemmick, \"that's over! He's a wonderful man, without his\nliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine\nwith him,\u2014and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.\"\nI felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.\n\"Wouldn't say it to anybody but yourself,\" he answered. \"I know that\nwhat is said between you and me goes no further.\"\nI asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, Mrs.\nBentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of\nthe Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned\nMiss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll\nof the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.\n\"Wemmick,\" said I, \"do you remember telling me, before I first went to\nMr. Jaggers's private house, to notice that housekeeper?\"\n\"Did I?\" he replied. \"Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,\" he added,\nsuddenly, \"I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.\"\n\"A wild beast tamed, you called her.\"\n\"And what do _you_ call her?\"\n\"The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?\"\n\"That's his secret. She has been with him many a long year.\"\n\"I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in\nbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\ngoes no further.\"\n\"Well!\" Wemmick replied, \"I don't know her story,\u2014that is, I don't know\nall of it. But what I do know I'll tell you. We are in our private and\npersonal capacities, of course.\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\nmurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\nwas up, as you may suppose.\"\n\"But she was acquitted.\"\n\"Mr. Jaggers was for her,\" pursued Wemmick, with a look full of\nmeaning, \"and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a\ndesperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and\nhe worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to\nhave made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day\nfor many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial\nwhere he couldn't work it himself, sat under counsel, and\u2014every one\nknew\u2014put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,\u2014a\nwoman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.\nIt was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman\nin Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick\n(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of\njealousy. The murdered woman,\u2014more a match for the man, certainly, in\npoint of years\u2014was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had\nbeen a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched\nand torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,\nthere was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this\nwoman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.\nJaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,\" said Wemmick,\ntouching me on the sleeve, \"that he never dwelt upon the strength of\nher hands then, though he sometimes does now.\"\nI had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\nparty.\n\"Well, sir!\" Wemmick went on; \"it happened\u2014happened, don't you\nsee?\u2014that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her\napprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\nparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a\nbruise or two about her,\u2014nothing for a tramp,\u2014but the backs of her\nhands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?\nNow, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of\nbrambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not\nhave got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles\nwere actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the\nfact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have\nbeen broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little\nspots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made\nwas this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that\nshe was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the\nmurder, frantically destroyed her child by this man\u2014some three years\nold\u2014to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:\n\"We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and\nwe show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and\nyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept\nall consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have\nscratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder\nof her child; why don't you? As to this case, if you _will_ have\nscratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted\nfor them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented\nthem?\" \"To sum up, sir,\" said Wemmick, \"Mr. Jaggers was altogether too\nmany for the jury, and they gave in.\"\n\"Has she been in his service ever since?\"\n\"Yes; but not only that,\" said Wemmick, \"she went into his service\nimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since\nbeen taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was\ntamed from the beginning.\"\n\"Do you remember the sex of the child?\"\n\"Said to have been a girl.\"\n\"You have nothing more to say to me to-night?\"\n\"Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.\"\nWe exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for",

But\nperhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my\nheart?\"\nWhen I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous\nright hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it\nagain before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.\n\"You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do\nsomething useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it\nnot?\"\n\"Something that I would like done very much.\"\n\"What is it?\"\nI began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had\nnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking\nin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be\nso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed\nthat she was conscious of the fact.\n\"Do you break off,\" she asked then, with her former air of being afraid\nof me, \"because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?\"\n\"No, no,\" I answered, \"how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped\nbecause I thought you were not following what I said.\"\n\"Perhaps I was not,\" she answered, putting a hand to her head. \"Begin\nagain, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.\"\nShe set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\nhabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\nforcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her\nhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in\nthis I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)\ninvolved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they\nwere the weighty secrets of another.\n\"So!\" said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. \"And\nhow much money is wanting to complete the purchase?\"\nI was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. \"Nine\nhundred pounds.\"\n\"If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as\nyou have kept your own?\"\n\"Quite as faithfully.\"\n\"And your mind will be more at rest?\"\n\"Much more at rest.\"\n\"Are you very unhappy now?\"\nShe asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an\nunwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my\nvoice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and\nsoftly laid her forehead on it.\n\"I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of\ndisquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.\"\nAfter a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire\nagain.\n\"It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\nunhappiness. Is it true?\"\n\"Too true.\"\n\"Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as\ndone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?\"\n\"Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the\ntone of the question. But there is nothing.\"\nShe presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\nfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung\nfrom her neck.\n\"You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?\"\n\"Quite. I dined with him yesterday.\"\n\"This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your\nirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if\nyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it\nto you.\"\n\"Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving\nit from him.\"\nShe read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\nreceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled\nagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\npencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without\nlooking at me.\n\"My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, \"I\nforgive her,\" though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\nit!\"\n\"O Miss Havisham,\" said I, \"I can do it now. There have been sore\nmistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want\nforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.\"\nShe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,\nand, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees\nat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have\nbeen raised to heaven from her mother's side.\nTo see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\ngave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got\nmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of\nmine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and\nwept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that\nthe relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was\nnot kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\n\"O!\" she cried, despairingly. \"What have I done! What have I done!\"\n\"If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me\nanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances.\nIs she married?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nIt was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house\nhad told me so.\n\"What have I done! What have I done!\" She wrung her hands, and crushed\nher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. \"What\nhave I done!\"\nI knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\nthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found\nvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light of\nday, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,\nher mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew\nequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her\npunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this\nearth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become\na master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,\nthe vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been\ncurses in this world?\n\"Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a\nlooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know\nwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!\" And so again,\ntwenty, fifty times over, What had she done!\n\"Miss Havisham,\" I said, when her cry had died away, \"you may dismiss\nme from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and\nif you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\npart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.\"\n\"Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip\u2014my dear!\" There was an earnest womanly\ncompassion for me in her new affection. \"My dear! Believe this: when\nshe first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At\nfirst, I meant no more.\"\n\"Well, well!\" said I. \"I hope so.\"\n\"But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did\nworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,\nand with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and\npoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.\"\n\"Better,\" I could not help saying, \"to have left her a natural heart,\neven to be bruised or broken.\"",

No\nmatter with what other words we parted; we parted.\nTwilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I\ncalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I\nwould not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before\nleaving. For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again,\nand I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.\nBy the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which\nthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and\nleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on\nend, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by\nthe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the\npaths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary\nall!\nTaking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little\ndoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at\nthe opposite door,\u2014not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started\nand swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was\nencumbered with a growth of fungus,\u2014when I turned my head to look back.\nA childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of\nthe slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to\nthe beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam\nshuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,\u2014though to be\nsure I was there in an instant.\nThe mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this\nillusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an\nindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I\nhad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on\ninto the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let\nme out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go\nupstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I\nhad left her. I took the latter course and went up.\nI looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in\nthe ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back\ntowards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly\naway, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw\nher running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about\nher, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.\nI had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.\nThat I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over\nher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same\npurpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,\nand all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the\nground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered\nher, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,\u2014that this\noccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or\nthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the\nfloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were\nfloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded\nbridal dress.\nThen, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\naway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries\nat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like\na prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or\nwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the\nflames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her\ngarments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.",

Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if I\nunreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire\nwould break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon's\ncoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my\nhands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of\nfeeling.\nOn examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,\nbut that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay\nmainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon's directions, her bed was\ncarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to\nbe well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again,\nan hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her\nstick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.\nThough every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she still\nhad something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had\ncovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with a\nwhite sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that\nhad been and was changed was still upon her.\nI found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I\ngot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next\npost. Miss Havisham's family I took upon myself; intending to\ncommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he\nliked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert,\nas soon as I returned to town.\nThere was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had\nhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she\nbegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that\nshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, \"What have I done!\"\nAnd then, \"When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like\nmine.\" And then, \"Take the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive\nher!'\" She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she\nsometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in\nanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.\nAs I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that\npressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could\nnot drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I\nwould return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and\nbeing taken up clear of the town.

What else?\"\n\"This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little\nchild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the\nyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore\nthat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he\nshould never see it again; then she vanished.\u2014There's the worst arm\ncomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right\nhand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light than\nby a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don't see the poor\nblistered patches too distinctly.\u2014You don't think your breathing is\naffected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.\"\n\"Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?\"\n\"There comes the darkest part of Provis's life. She did.\"\n\"That is, he says she did.\"\n\"Why, of course, my dear boy,\" returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,\nand again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. \"He says it all.\nI have no other information.\"\n\"No, to be sure.\"\n\"Now, whether,\" pursued Herbert, \"he had used the child's mother ill,\nor whether he had used the child's mother well, Provis doesn't say; but\nshe had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he\ndescribed to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for\nher, and forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be\ncalled upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause\nof her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept\nhimself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was\nonly vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the\njealousy arose. After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost\nthe child and the child's mother.\"",

This I had strongly suspected from Provis's\naccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;\nwhich I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers's\nclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reason\nfor claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this\nunconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers's part before, though I was quite sure\nof it now.\n\"So!

It was the slightest\nstart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the\nsooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the\naction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the\nannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just\nthen, lest Mr. Jaggers's sharpness should detect that there had been\nsome communication unknown to him between us.\n\"And on what evidence, Pip,\" asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he\npaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, \"does Provis make\nthis claim?\"\n\"He does not make it,\" said I, \"and has never made it, and has no\nknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.\"\nFor once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so\nunexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\nwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked\nwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.\nThen I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation\nthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact\nknew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look\ntowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been\nfor some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers's look.

I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had\nlapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had\nmade: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I\nrepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence\nfrom him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said\nthat I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted\nassurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,\nand why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he\ncared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,\nand that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,\nwhatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\nelse in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and\nsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to\nWemmick, and said, \"Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle\nheart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the\ninnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\nlife. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to\nrepresent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be\nmore open with me!\"\nI have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.\nJaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving\ncrossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his\nemployment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something\nlike a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.\n\"What's all this?\" said Mr. Jaggers. \"You with an old father, and you\nwith pleasant and playful ways?\"\n\"Well!\" returned Wemmick. \"If I don't bring 'em here, what does it\nmatter?\"\n\"Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling\nopenly, \"this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.\"\n\"Not a bit of it,\" returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. \"I\nthink you're another.\"\nAgain they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still\ndistrustful that the other was taking him in.",

Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn't wonder if _you_ might be\nplanning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of\nthese days, when you're tired of all this work.\"\nMr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and\nactually drew a sigh. \"Pip,\" said he, \"we won't talk about 'poor\ndreams;' you know more about such things than I, having much fresher\nexperience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I'll put a\ncase to you. Mind! I admit nothing.\"\nHe waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly\nsaid that he admitted nothing.\n\"Now, Pip,\" said Mr. Jaggers, \"put this case. Put the case that a\nwoman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child\nconcealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal\nadviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to\nthe latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put\nthe case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\neccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.\"\n\"I follow you, sir.\"\n\"Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he\nsaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\ndestruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\na criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that\nhe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,\nneglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing\nup to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\nin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,\nto develop into the fish that were to come to his net,\u2014to be\nprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.\"\n\"I follow you, sir.\"\n\"Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the\nheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make\nno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this\npower: \"I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so,\nyou did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you\nthrough it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it\nshould be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be\nproduced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring\nyou off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,\nyour child is still saved.\" Put the case that this was done, and that\nthe woman was cleared.\"\n\"I understand you perfectly.\"\n\"But that I make no admissions?\"\n\"That you make no admissions.\" And Wemmick repeated, \"No admissions.\"\n\"Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little\nshaken the woman's intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,\nshe was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be\nsheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the\nold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\nout, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend\nthe imaginary case?\"\n\"Quite.\"\n\"Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That\nthe mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the\nmother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\nmiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was\nstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case\nto yourself very carefully.\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.\"\nAnd Wemmick said, \"I do.\"\n\"For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father's? I think\nhe would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother's? I\nthink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For\nthe daughter's? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her\nparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to\ndisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for\nlife. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her\nthe subject of those 'poor dreams' which have, at one time or another,\nbeen in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you\nthat you had better\u2014and would much sooner when you had thought well of\nit\u2014chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right\nhand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut _that_ off\ntoo.\"\nI looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his\nlips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.\n\"Now, Wemmick,\" said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, \"what\nitem was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?\"",

For this reason, I suppose, they were now\ninflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and\nWemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest\npoint in abeyance for a moment.

This individual, who, either in his own person or\nin that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble\n(which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest\ndaughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting.

Now burn.\"\nWhen I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire\u2014but not\nbefore we had both got it by heart\u2014we considered what to do. For, of\ncourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.\n\"I have thought it over again and again,\" said Herbert, \"and I think I\nknow a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A\ngood fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and\nhonourable.\"\nI had thought of him more than once.\n\"But how much would you tell him, Herbert?\"\n\"It is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere\nfreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know\nthat there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.\nYou go with him?\"\n\"No doubt.\"\n\"Where?\"\nIt had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the\npoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,\u2014Hamburg, Rotterdam,\nAntwerp,\u2014the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I\nhad always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\nboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\nleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\ndown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\nuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\nlay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\nmade inquiries beforehand.\nHerbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\nHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\nsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\nourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separated\nfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\nHerbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\nwithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o'clock reported it\ndone. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\nStartop, and he was more than ready to join.\nThose two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;\nour charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our\nobject, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not\ncome home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that\nhe should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he\nshould prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on\nWednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the\narrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that\nhe should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on\nboard.",

It had been delivered by hand (of course, since I left\nhome), and its contents were these:\u2014\n\"If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow\nnight at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,\nyou had better come. If you want information regarding _your uncle\nProvis_, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time.\n_You must come alone_. Bring this with you.\"\nI had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange\nletter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I\nmust decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would\ntake me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of\ngoing, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And\nagain, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some\nimportant bearing on the flight itself.\nIf I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still\nhave gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,\u2014my watch showing\nme that the coach started within half an hour,\u2014I resolved to go. I\nshould certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle\nProvis. That, coming on Wemmick's letter and the morning's busy\npreparation, turned the scale.\nIt is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of\nalmost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this\nmysterious epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be\nsecret got mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same\nmechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling\nhim that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I",

The morning\nhurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had\nwaited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now\nI began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt\nwhether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider\nwhether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against\never heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through\nall those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose\nvery few hurried people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis\nby name mastered everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already\nwithout knowing it,\u2014if that be reasoning,\u2014in case any harm should\nbefall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!\nIt was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary\nto me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside\nin my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of\nminor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was\npreparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she\nwas still very ill, though considered something better.\nMy inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I\ndined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able\nto cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for\nme. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain\nme with my own story,\u2014of course with the popular feature that\nPumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.\n\"Do you know the young man?\" said I.\n\"Know him!\" repeated the landlord. \"Ever since he was\u2014no height at\nall.\"\n\"Does he ever come back to this neighbourhood?\"\n\"Ay, he comes back,\" said the landlord, \"to his great friends, now and\nagain, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.\"\n\"What man is that?\"\n\"Him that I speak of,\" said the landlord. \"Mr. Pumblechook.\"\n\"Is he ungrateful to no one else?\"\n\"No doubt he would be, if he could,\" returned the landlord, \"but he\ncan't. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.\"\n\"Does Pumblechook say so?\"\n\"Say so!\" replied the landlord. \"He han't no call to say so.\"\n\"But does he say so?\"\n\"It would turn a man's blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of\nit, sir,\" said the landlord.\nI thought, \"Yet Joe, dear Joe, _you_ never tell of it. Long-suffering\nand loving Joe, _you_ never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!\"\n\"Your appetite's been touched like by your accident,\" said the\nlandlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. \"Try a tenderer\nbit.\"\n\"No, thank you,\" I replied, turning from the table to brood over the\nfire. \"I can eat no more. Please take it away.\"\nI had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as\nthrough the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;\nthe meaner he, the nobler Joe.\nMy heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the\nfire for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not\nfrom my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened\nround my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for\nthe letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it,\nand was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of\nthe coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the\nlittle sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.",

So, having come there against my\ninclination, I went on against it.\nThe direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor\nthat in which we had pursued the convicts.

And you'll take any pains, and spend any money, to\ndrive me out of this country, will you?\" said he, repeating my words to\nBiddy in the last interview I had with her. \"Now, I'll tell you a piece\nof information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of\nthis country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty\ntimes told, to the last brass farden!\" As he shook his heavy hand at\nme, with his mouth snarling like a tiger's, I felt that it was true.\n\"What are you going to do to me?\"\n\"I'm a-going,\" said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a\nheavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,\u2014\"I'm\na-going to have your life!\"\nHe leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it\nacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.\n\"You was always in Old Orlick's way since ever you was a child. You\ngoes out of his way this present night. He'll have no more on you.\nYou're dead.\"\nI felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked\nwildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.\n\"More than that,\" said he, folding his arms on the table again, \"I\nwon't have a rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth.\nI'll put your body in the kiln,\u2014I'd carry two such to it, on my",

Estella's father would believe I had deserted him,\nwould be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,\nwhen he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had\ncalled at Miss Havisham's gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would\nnever know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I\nhad suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed\nthrough. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible\nthan death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And so\nquick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn\ngenerations,\u2014Estella's children, and their children,\u2014while the wretch's\nwords were yet on his lips.\n\"Now, wolf,\" said he, \"afore I kill you like any other beast,\u2014which is\nwot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,\u2014I'll have a good look\nat you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!\"\nIt had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few\ncould know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the\nhopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by\na scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I\nresolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some\nlast poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of\nmen were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of\nHeaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no\nfarewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to\nme, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my\nmiserable errors,\u2014still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I\nwould have done it.\nHe had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his\nneck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink\nslung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and\ntook a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw\nflash into his face.\n\"Wolf!\" said he, folding his arms again, \"Old Orlick's a-going to tell\nyou somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.\"\nAgain my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted\nthe whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her\ndeath, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.\n\"It was you, villain,\" said I.\n\"I tell you it was your doing,\u2014I tell you it was done through you,\" he\nretorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the\nvacant air between us. \"I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you\nto-night. _I_ giv' it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a\nlimekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn't have come\nto life again. But it warn't Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was\nfavoured, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?\nNow you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.\"\nHe drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of the\nbottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly\nunderstood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an\nend of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew\nthat when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept\ntowards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he\nwould do as he had done in my sister's case,\u2014make all haste to the\ntown, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My\nrapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with\nhim in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and\nthe white vapour creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.\nIt was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years\nwhile he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented\npictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of\nmy brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons\nwithout seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of\nthese images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him\nhimself,\u2014who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!\u2014that\nI knew of the slightest action of his fingers.\nWhen he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which he\nsat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,\nshading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me,\nstood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.\n\"Wolf, I'll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled\nover on your stairs that night.\"\nI saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of\nthe heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman's lantern on the wall. I\nsaw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;\nthere, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.\n\"And why was Old Orlick there? I'll tell you something more, wolf. You\nand her _have_ pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as\ngetting a easy living in it goes, and I've took up with new companions,\nand new masters. Some of 'em writes my letters when I wants 'em\nwrote,\u2014do you mind?\u2014writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;\nthey're not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I've had a firm mind\nand a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your\nsister's burying. I han't seen a way to get you safe, and I've looked\narter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,\n'Somehow or another I'll have him!' What! When I looks for you, I finds\nyour uncle Provis, eh?\"\nMill Pond Bank, and Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,\nall so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was\nover, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his\nback, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running\nout to sea!\n\"_You_ with a uncle too! Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so\nsmall a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and\nthumb and chucked you away dead (as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times,\nwhen I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you\nhadn't found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for\nto hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old\nOrlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year\nago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a\nbullock, as he means to drop you\u2014hey?\u2014when he come for to hear\nthat\u2014hey?\"\nIn his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I\nturned my face aside to save it from the flame.\n\"Ah!\" he cried, laughing, after doing it again, \"the burnt child dreads\nthe fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was\nsmuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick's a match for you and\nknow'd you'd come to-night! Now I'll tell you something more, wolf, and\nthis ends it. There's them that's as good a match for your uncle Provis\nas Old Orlick has been for you. Let him 'ware them, when he's lost his\nnevvy! Let him 'ware them, when no man can't find a rag of his dear\nrelation's clothes, nor yet a bone of his body.

My eyes were fixed on the\nladder against the wall, when I came to myself,\u2014had opened on it before\nmy mind saw it,\u2014and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\nwas in the place where I had lost it.\nToo indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who\nsupported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came\nbetween me and it a face. The face of Trabb's boy!\n\"I think he's all right!\" said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice; \"but\nain't he just pale though!\"\nAt these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\nand I saw my supporter to be\u2014\n\"Herbert! Great Heaven!\"\n\"Softly,\" said Herbert. \"Gently, Handel. Don't be too eager.\"\n\"And our old comrade, Startop!\" I cried, as he too bent over me.\n\"Remember what he is going to assist us in,\" said Herbert, \"and be\ncalm.\"\nThe allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in\nmy arm. \"The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\nto-night? How long have I been here?\" For, I had a strange and strong\nmisgiving that I had been lying there a long time\u2014a day and a\nnight,\u2014two days and nights,\u2014more.\n\"The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.\"\n\"Thank God!\"\n\"And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,\" said Herbert. \"But\nyou can't help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can\nyou stand?\"\n\"Yes, yes,\" said I, \"I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\narm.\"\nThey laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen\nand inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they\ntore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully\nreplaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain\nsome cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the\ndoor of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the\nquarry on our way back. Trabb's boy\u2014Trabb's overgrown young man\nnow\u2014went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come\nin at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I\nhad last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.\nThe white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as\nI had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.\nEntreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,\u2014which at\nfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\nquiet,\u2014I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\nchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\nmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was\ngone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\nhour's consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\nvolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.\nFinding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\nresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\nBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\nfinding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's, where they lost me.\nHereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\nI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.\nAmong the loungers under the Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's\nBoy,\u2014true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he\nhad no business,\u2014and Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss\nHavisham's in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's boy became\ntheir guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by\nthe town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went\nalong, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought\nthere on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's\nsafety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be\nmischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and\nwent on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,\nendeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could\nhear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was\nwhile my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I\nwas there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,\nand rushed in, closely followed by the other two.\nWhen I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our\nimmediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it\nwas, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such\na course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be\nfatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\npresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\nlight of the matter to Trabb's boy; who, I am convinced, would have\nbeen much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his\nintervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb's boy was of a\nmalignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it\nwas in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's\nexpense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed\nto meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an\nill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).\nWednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London",

Herbert\ngot a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this\nstuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear\nits pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,\nand I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.\nMy terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for\nto-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of\nitself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the\nmental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon\nme that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with\nsuch consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.\nNo precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from\ncommunication with him that day; yet this again increased my\nrestlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing\nthat he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me\nso. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was\nsomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the\nfact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days\nwore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,\nmy overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow\nmorning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning\nhead throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to\nhigh numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew\nin prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\nfatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to\nmyself with a start, \"Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!\"\nThey kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed,\nand gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the\nnotion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and\nthe opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed\nand went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for\nfour-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last\nself-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept\nsoundly.\nWednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking\nlights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a\nmarsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was\nspanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there\nat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the\nclustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the\nunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn\nfrom the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.\nFrom me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.\nHerbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on\nthe sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the\nfire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In\ngood time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the\nsharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still\nflowing towards us.\n\"When it turns at nine o'clock,\" said Herbert, cheerfully, \"look out",

The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being\nwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,\nand row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long\nreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is\nbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and\nwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we\ncould choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all\nnight. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would\nstart from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at\nwhat time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail\nthe first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we\nshould have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each\nvessel.\nThe relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was\nso great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in\nwhich I had been a few hours before.

By that time the river had lifted us a\nlittle, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on\nthe low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into\nblack; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were\nthe rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,\nsave here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.\nAs the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,\nwould not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for\nclearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could\nfind. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for\nanything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or\nfive dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with\nher galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.\nThe night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and\nwhat light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as\nthe oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.\nAt this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we\nwere followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular\nintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or\nother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and\nthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\ncreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them\nnervously. Sometimes, \"What was that ripple?\" one of us would say in a\nlow voice. Or another, \"Is that a boat yonder?\" And afterwards we would\nfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with\nwhat an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.\nAt length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran\nalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard\nby. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light\nto be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I\ndare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good\nfire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various\nliquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,\u2014\"such as\nthey were,\" the landlord said. No other company was in the house than\nthe landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the \"Jack\" of the\nlittle causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been\nlow-water mark too.\nWith this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came\nashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all\nelse, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the\nkitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop\nwere to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as\ncarefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there\nwere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have\nthought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,\nnotwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.\nWhile we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the",

Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,\nshe kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or\ntwo when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and\nlooked at us attentively,\u2014as did all the rowers; the other sitter was\nwrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some\ninstruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in\neither boat.\nStartop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\nand gave me the word \"Hamburg,\" in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\nShe was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew\nlouder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,\nwhen the galley hailed us. I answered.\n\"You have a returned Transport there,\" said the man who held the lines.\n\"That's the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\notherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\nand you to assist.\"\nAt the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\nhe ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke\nahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on\nto our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\nconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\nheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but\nfelt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw\nthe steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner's shoulder,\nand saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,\nand saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\nfrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,\nlean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\nshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that\nthe face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.\nStill, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white\nterror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board\nthe steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink\nfrom under me.\nIt was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\nmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\ntaken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;\nbut our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.\nWhat with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of",

I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his\nprivate house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and\nMr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing. It was the\nsole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five\nminutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could\nprevent its going against us.\nI imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\nfate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\nhaving \"let it slip through my fingers,\" and said we must memorialise\nby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal\nfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which the\nforfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this\ncase to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not\nrelated to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;\nhe had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his\napprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I\nfinally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my\nheart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to\nestablish one.\nThere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had\nhoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some\naccurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs.

Among these were the name of a\nbanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\ninformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\nJaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His\nignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but\nthat my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.\nAfter three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over\nfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness\ncame, and completed the easy case.

I had not seen him\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had\ncome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of\nexplanation in reference to that failure.\n\"The late Compeyson,\" said Wemmick, \"had by little and little got at\nthe bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was\nfrom the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people\nbeing always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,\nseeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I\nthought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only\nsuppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,\nhabitually to deceive his own instruments. You don't blame me, I hope,\nMr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.\"\n\"I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most\nearnestly for all your interest and friendship.\"\n\"Thank you, thank you very much. It's a bad job,\" said Wemmick,\nscratching his head, \"and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a\nlong time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable\nproperty. Dear me!\"\n\"What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.\"\n\"Yes, to be sure,\" said Wemmick. \"Of course, there can be no objection\nto your being sorry for him, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself\nto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and\nbeing so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have\nbeen saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been\nsaved. That's the difference between the property and the owner, don't\nyou see?\"\nI invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of\ngrog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\nwas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up\nto it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,\u2014\n\"What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?\"\n\"Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.\"\n\"These twelve years, more likely,\" said Wemmick. \"Yes. I'm going to\ntake a holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk. More than\nthat; I'm going to ask you to take a walk with me.\"\nI was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,\nwhen Wemmick anticipated me.\n\"I know your engagements,\" said he, \"and I know you are out of sorts,\nMr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\nIt ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy you\n(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn't you\nstretch a point and manage it?\"\nHe had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\nto do for him. I said I could manage it,\u2014would manage it,\u2014and he was so\nvery much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\nparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\npast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.",

      "text": "Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday\nmorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking\ntighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two\nglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have\nbeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his\nbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\nWhen we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and\nwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was\nconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it\nover his shoulder. \"Why, we are not going fishing!\" said I. \"No,\"\nreturned Wemmick, \"but I like to walk with one.\"\nI thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went\ntowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said\nsuddenly,\u2014\n\"Halloa! Here's a church!\"\nThere was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\nsurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,\u2014\n\"Let's go in!\"\nWe went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked\nall round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,\nand getting something out of paper there.\n\"Halloa!\" said he. \"Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 'em\non!\"\nAs the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\nto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\nwere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\ndoor, escorting a lady.\n\"Halloa!\" said Wemmick. \"Here's Miss Skiffins! Let's have a wedding.\"\nThat discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\nAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the\naltar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to\nput him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\npillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\ngentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\nresistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\nperfection.\nThe clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\nthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\npreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out\nof his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, \"Halloa! Here's a\nring!\"\nI acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;\nwhile a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a\nfeint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of\ngiving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the\nclergyman's being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.\nWhen he said, \"Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?\" the\nold gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we\nhad arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.\nUpon which, the clergyman said again, \"WHO giveth this woman to be\nmarried to this man?\" The old gentleman being still in a state of most\nestimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed\nvoice, \"Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?\" To which the Aged replied\nwith great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, \"All right, John,\nall right, my boy!\" And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon\nit, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely\nmarried that day.\nIt was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\nWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,\nand put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,\nput her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. \"_Now_, Mr.\nPip,\" said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\nout, \"let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\nwedding-party!\"\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\nboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\nthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\nunwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in\na high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,\nand submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have\ndone.\nWe had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\ntable, Wemmick said, \"Provided by contract, you know; don't be afraid\nof it!\" I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the\nCastle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I\ncould.\nWemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with\nhim, and wished him joy.\n\"Thankee!\" said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. \"She's such a manager of\nfowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\nyourself. I say, Mr. Pip!\" calling me back, and speaking low. \"This is\naltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.\"\n\"I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,\" said I.\nWemmick nodded. \"After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may\nas well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or\nsomething of the kind.\"",

It was a consequence of his\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\nvery little.

This gave me opportunities of\nbeing with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for his\nillness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\ndetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\nAlthough I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\ndo not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\nwasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\nwhen the prison door closed upon him.\nThe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\nwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\ncircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\nway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\nIt happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his\ndesperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in\nattendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his\neyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had\nseen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was\na little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I\nnever knew him complain.",

But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds\nbefore me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that\nI saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\nsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him.\nThe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,\ndown to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering\nin the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside\nit at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and\nwomen; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\nweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\nstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\nand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\ngallery full of people,\u2014a large theatrical audience,\u2014looked on, as the\ntwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\naddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\nbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments\nand punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of\nyears; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had\nmade his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable\nman would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when\nfar removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a\npeaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those\npropensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered\nhim a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and\nrepentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.\nBeing here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading\nthe officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of\nflight, he had resisted them, and had\u2014he best knew whether by express\ndesign, or in the blindness of his hardihood\u2014caused the death of his\ndenouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment\nfor his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his\ncase being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\nThe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\nlight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\nwith absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all\nthings, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face\nin this way of light, the prisoner said, \"My Lord, I have received my\nsentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,\" and sat down\nagain. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had\nto say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of\nthem were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard\nlook of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three\nshook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had\ntaken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of\nhaving to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held\nmy hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got\nup (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),\nand pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him\nand me.",

      "text": "The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more\nstrictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an\nintention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I\nsat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,\nthat I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the\nsingleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There\nwas duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer\nalways gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick\nprisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as\nsick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be\nthanked!) always joined in the same report.\nAs the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\nlooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\nsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\nunderstand his meaning very well.\nThe number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in\nhim than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and\nlighted up as I entered.\n\"Dear boy,\" he said, as I sat down by his bed: \"I thought you was late.\nBut I knowed you couldn't be that.\"\n\"It is just the time,\" said I. \"I waited for it at the gate.\"\n\"You always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?\"\n\"Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.\"\n\"Thank'ee dear boy, thank'ee. God bless you! You've never deserted me,\ndear boy.\"\nI pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once\nmeant to desert him.\n\"And what's the best of all,\" he said, \"you've been more comfortable\nalonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.\nThat's best of all.\"\nHe lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,\nand love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and\na film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.\n\"Are you in much pain to-day?\"\n\"I don't complain of none, dear boy.\"\n\"You never do complain.\"\nHe had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to\nmean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid\nit there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.\nThe allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,\n\"You needn't go yet.\" I thanked him gratefully, and asked, \"Might I\nspeak to him, if he can hear me?\"\nThe governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\nthough it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid\nlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.\n\"Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I\nsay?\"\nA gentle pressure on my hand.\n\"You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.\"\nA stronger pressure on my hand.\n\"She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a\nlady and very beautiful. And I love her!\"\nWith a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my\nyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying\non it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,\nand his head dropped quietly on his breast.\nMindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men\nwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better\nwords that I could say beside his bed, than \"O Lord, be merciful to him",

For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your\nbeing ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post,\nand being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal\nof walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part,\nand marriage were the great wish of his hart\u2014\"\n\"It is so delightful to hear you, Joe!

And Biddy, her word were, 'Go\nto him, without loss of time.' That,\" said Joe, summing up with his\njudicial air, \"were the word of Biddy. 'Go to him,' Biddy say, 'without\nloss of time.' In short, I shouldn't greatly deceive you,\" Joe added,\nafter a little grave reflection, \"if I represented to you that the word\nof that young woman were, 'without a minute's loss of time.'\"\nThere Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to\nin great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at\nstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that\nI was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay\nquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in\nit.\nEvidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at\nhim, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the\npride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its\ncurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as\nthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the\nroom kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own\nwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,\nJoe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the\npen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his\nsleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was\nnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,\nand to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;\nand when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\nhave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen\nspluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on\nthe side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into\nspace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was\ntripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he\ngot on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had\nremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\nhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the\neffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,\nwith unbounded satisfaction.\nNot to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to\ntalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He\nshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.",

I call upon\nyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.'\"\n\"The man says?\" I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\n\"The man says,\" Joe assented. \"Is he right, that man?\"\n\"Dear Joe, he is always right.\"\n\"Well, old chap,\" said Joe, \"then abide by your words. If he's always\nright (which in general he's more likely wrong), he's right when he\nsays this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when\nyou was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know'd as J.\nGargery's power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal\nto his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two\nsech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy\ngiv' herself a deal o' trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost\nawful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this\nlight, as I should so put it. Both of which,\" said Joe, quite charmed\nwith his logical arrangement, \"being done, now this to you a true\nfriend, say. Namely. You mustn't go a overdoing on it, but you must\nhave your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt\nthe sheets.\"\nThe delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact\nand kindness with which Biddy\u2014who with her woman's wit had found me out\nso soon\u2014had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\nwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all\ndissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\nunderstand.\nAnother thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\ndevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\nof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\neasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\nfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\nthe dear \"old Pip, old chap,\" that now were music in my ears. I too had\nfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\nimperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe's hold upon them began\nto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\nall mine.\nAh! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\nin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\nJoe's innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\nstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\nloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?\nIt was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\nTemple Gardens leaning on Joe's arm, that I saw this change in him very\nplainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at\nthe river, and I chanced to say as we got up,\u2014\n\"See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back\nby myself.\"\n\"Which do not overdo it, Pip,\" said Joe; \"but I shall be happy fur to\nsee you able, sir.\"\nThe last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\nfurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker\nthan I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\nthoughtful.\nI, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\nchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\ndown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\nquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\nsavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\nmust not suffer him to do it.\nIt was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\nbed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,\u2014to-morrow being\nSunday,\u2014and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\nmorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\nlast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\n(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\nout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\ncleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\narrived at a resolution too.\nWe had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\nthen walked in the fields.\n\"I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,\" I said.\n\"Dear old Pip, old chap, you're a'most come round, sir.\"\n\"It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.\"\n\"Likeways for myself, sir,\" Joe returned.\n\"We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\ndays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\nforget these.\"\n\"Pip,\" said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, \"there has",

No. You needn't bring any, William.\"\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand\nover me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\n\"Little more than skin and bone!\" mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. \"And\nyet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread\nafore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!\"\nThis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, \"May I?\"\nand the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\nsame fat five fingers.\n\"Hah!\" he went on, handing me the bread and butter. \"And air you\na-going to Joseph?\"\n\"In heaven's name,\" said I, firing in spite of myself, \"what does it\nmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.\"\nIt was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\nthe opportunity he wanted.\n\"Yes, young man,\" said he, releasing the handle of the article in\nquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, \"I _will_ leave that\nteapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I\nforgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to\nwish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of\nprodigygality, to be stimilated by the 'olesome nourishment of your\nforefathers. And yet,\" said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and\nwaiter, and pointing me out at arm's length, \"this is him as I ever\nsported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I\ntell you this is him!\"\nA low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\nparticularly affected.\n\"This is him,\" said Pumblechook, \"as I have rode in my shay-cart. This\nis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\nof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M'ria from\nher own mother, let him deny it if he can!\"\nThe waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\nthe case a black look.\n\"Young man,\" said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\nfashion, \"you air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask\nme, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to\nJoseph.\"\nThe waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\n\"Now,\" said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of\nsaying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\nconclusive, \"I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\nthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is\nWilliam, which his father's name was Potkins if I do not deceive\nmyself.\"\n\"You do not, sir,\" said William.\n\"In their presence,\" pursued Pumblechook, \"I will tell you, young man,\nwhat to say to Joseph. Says you, \"Joseph, I have this day seen my\nearliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun's. I will name no\nnames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\nseen that man.\"\n\"I swear I don't see him here,\" said I.\n\"Say that likewise,\" retorted Pumblechook. \"Say you said that, and even\nJoseph will probably betray surprise.\"\n\"There you quite mistake him,\" said I. \"I know better.\"\n\"Says you,\" Pumblechook went on, \"'Joseph, I have seen that man, and\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\ncharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\nignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\ngratitoode. Yes, Joseph,' says you,\" here Pumblechook shook his head\nand hand at me, \"'he knows my total deficiency of common human\ngratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,\nJoseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.'\"\nWindy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\nto talk thus to mine.\n\"Says you, 'Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\nrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\nProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\nplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode to\nhis earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's_. But that man said he\ndid not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to\ndo it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would\ndo it again.'\"\n\"It's pity,\" said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted\nbreakfast, \"that the man did not say what he had done and would do\nagain.\"\n\"Squires of the Boar!\" Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,\n\"and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town\nor down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do\nit, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.\"\nWith those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\nand left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by",

Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe's\nrestoring touch was on my shoulder. \"Which he warn't strong enough, my\ndear, fur to be surprised,\" said Joe. And Biddy said, \"I ought to have\nthought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.\" They were both so\noverjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to\nthem, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their\nday complete!\nMy first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never\nbreathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me\nin my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been\nhis knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!\n\"Dear Biddy,\" said I, \"you have the best husband in the whole world,\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would have\u2014But no, you\ncouldn't love him better than you do.\"\n\"No, I couldn't indeed,\" said Biddy.\n\"And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble\nJoe!\"\nJoe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before\nhis eyes.\n\"And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in\ncharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you\nhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I\nam going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I\nshall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have\nkept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don't think, dear Joe\nand Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I\ncould cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if\nI could!\"\nThey were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no\nmore.\n\"But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter\nnight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\never. Don't tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell him, Biddy,\nthat I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured you\nboth, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child,\nI said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I\ndid.\"\n\"I ain't a-going,\" said Joe, from behind his sleeve, \"to tell him\nnothink o' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't.\"\n\"And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind\nhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you\nsay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and\nthen I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better\nof me, in the time to come!\"\n\"O dear old Pip, old chap,\" said Joe. \"God knows as I forgive you, if I\nhave anythink to forgive!\"\n\"Amen! And God knows I do!\" echoed Biddy.\n\"Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few\nminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go\nwith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say\ngood-bye!\"",

As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away,\nwhen it stopped, and let me come up with it.

I wonder you know me.\"\nThe freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable\nmajesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,\nI had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,\nsoftened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was\nthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand.\nWe sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, \"After so many years,\nit is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our\nfirst meeting was! Do you often come back?\"\n\"I have never been here since.\"\n\"Nor I.\"\nThe moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white\nceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought\nof the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had\nheard on earth.\nEstella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.\n\"I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been\nprevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!\"\nThe silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and\nthe same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes.

It is the only possession I have not\nrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I\nhave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I\nmade in all the wretched years.\"\n\"Is it to be built on?\"\n\"At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And\nyou,\" she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,\u2014\"you\nlive abroad still?\"\n\"Still.\"\n\"And do well, I am sure?\"\n\"I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore\u2014yes, I do\nwell.\"\n\"I have often thought of you,\" said Estella.\n\"Have you?\"\n\"Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from\nme the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant\nof its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the\nadmission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.\"\n\"You have always held your place in my heart,\" I answered.\nAnd we were silent again until she spoke.\n\"I little thought,\" said Estella, \"that I should take leave of you in\ntaking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.\"\n\"Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,\nthe remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and\npainful.\"\n\"But you said to me,\" returned Estella, very earnestly, \"'God bless\nyou, God forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will\nnot hesitate to say that to me now,\u2014now, when suffering has been\nstronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what\nyour heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but\u2014I hope\u2014into a\nbetter shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me\nwe are friends.\"\n\"We are friends,\" said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from\nthe bench.\n\"And will continue friends apart,\" said Estella.\nI took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as\nthe morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so\nthe evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of\ntranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting\nfrom her.",
