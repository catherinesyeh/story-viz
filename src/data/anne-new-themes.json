Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down\ninto a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and\ntraversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the\nold Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook\nin its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool\nand cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde's Hollow it was a quiet,\nwell-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs.\nRachel Lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum; it\nprobably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window,\nkeeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children\nup, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never\nrest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.\nThere are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend\nclosely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own;\nbut Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage\ntheir own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a\nnotable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she \"ran\" the\nSewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop\nof the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all\nthis Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen\nwindow, knitting \"cotton warp\" quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them,\nas Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping\na sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up\nthe steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular\npeninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two\nsides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that\nhill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel's all-seeing\neye.",

The sun was coming in\nat the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house\nwas in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of\nbees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called \"Rachel\nLynde's husband\"--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field\nbeyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on\nthe big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew\nthat he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening\nbefore in William J. Blair's store over at Carmody that he meant to sow\nhis turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for\nMatthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about\nanything in his whole life.\nAnd yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon\nof a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill;\nmoreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was\nplain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy\nand the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable\ndistance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going\nthere?\nHad it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this\nand that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both\nquestions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be\nsomething pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest\nman alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where\nhe might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and\ndriving in a buggy, was something that didn't happen often. Mrs. Rachel,\nponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoon's\nenjoyment was spoiled.\n\"I'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla\nwhere he's gone and why,\" the worthy woman finally concluded. \"He\ndoesn't generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if\nhe'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to\ngo for more; he wasn't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor.\nYet something must have happened since last night to start him off. I'm\nclean puzzled, that's what, and I won't know a minute's peace of mind or\nconscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea\ntoday.\"",

      "text": "Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the\nbig, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a\nscant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde's Hollow. To be sure, the\nlong lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert's father, as\nshy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly\ncould from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods\nwhen he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest\nedge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible\nfrom the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so\nsociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place\n_living_ at all.\n\"It's just _staying_, that's what,\" she said as she stepped along the\ndeep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. \"It's no wonder\nMatthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by\nthemselves. Trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were\nthere'd be enough of them. I'd ruther look at people. To be sure, they\nseem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they're used to it. A body\ncan get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.\"\nWith this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green\nGables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one\nside with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies.\nNot a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have\nseen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla\nCuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could\nhave eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial\npeck of dirt.\nMrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in\nwhen bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful\napartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully\nclean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its\nwindows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on\nthe back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one,\nwhence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left\norchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook,\nwas greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when\nshe sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to\nher too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to\nbe taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind\nher was laid for supper.\nMrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental\nnote of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid,\nso that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but\nthe dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves\nand one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any\nparticular company. Yet what of Matthew's white collar and the sorrel\nmare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery\nabout quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.",

How are all your folks?\"\nSomething that for lack of any other name might be called friendship\nexisted and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel,\nin spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.\nMarilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark\nhair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little\nknot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She\nlooked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she\nwas; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had\nbeen ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative\nof a sense of humor.\n\"We're all pretty well,\" said Mrs. Rachel. \"I was kind of afraid _you_\nweren't, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe\nhe was going to the doctor's.\"\nMarilla's lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs.\nRachel up; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so\nunaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity.\n\"Oh, no, I'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday,\" she\nsaid. \"Matthew went to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an\norphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming on the train tonight.\"\nIf Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a\nkangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.\nShe was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable\nthat Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to\nsuppose it.\n\"Are you in earnest, Marilla?\" she demanded when voice returned to her.\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums\nin Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated\nAvonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.\nMrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt.

      "text": "turning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this!\nNothing!\n\"What on earth put such a notion into your head?\" she demanded\ndisapprovingly.\nThis had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be\ndisapproved.\n\"Well, we've been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,\"\nreturned Marilla. \"Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before\nChristmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the\nasylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs.\nSpencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have\ntalked it over off and on ever since. We thought we'd get a boy. Matthew\nis getting up in years, you know--he's sixty--and he isn't so spry as he\nonce was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate\nhard it's got to be to get hired help. There's never anybody to be had\nbut those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do\nget one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the\nlobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a\nHome boy. But I said 'no' flat to that. 'They may be all right--I'm not\nsaying they're not--but no London street Arabs for me,' I said. 'Give\nme a native born at least. There'll be a risk, no matter who we get. But\nI'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born\nCanadian.' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out\none when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she\nwas going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer's folks at Carmody\nto bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that\nwould be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores\nright off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him\na good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer\ntoday--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming\non the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to\nmeet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to\nWhite Sands station herself.\"\nMrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to\nspeak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece\nof news.\n\"Well, Marilla, I'll just tell you plain that I think you're doing a\nmighty foolish thing--a risky thing, that's what. You don't know what\nyou're getting. You're bringing a strange child into your house and home\nand you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is\nlike nor what sort of parents he had nor how he's likely to turn out.\nWhy, it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up\nwest of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to\nthe house at night--set it _on purpose_, Marilla--and nearly burnt them to\na crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an adopted boy used\nto suck the eggs--they couldn't break him of it. If you had asked my\nadvice in the matter--which you didn't do, Marilla--I'd have said for\nmercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what.\"\nThis Job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla. She\nknitted steadily on.\n\"I don't deny there's something in what you say, Rachel. I've had some\nqualms myself. But Matthew was terrible set on it. I could see that, so\nI gave in. It's so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he\ndoes I always feel it's my duty to give in. And as for the risk, there's\nrisks in pretty near everything a body does in this world. There's risks\nin people's having children of their own if it comes to that--they don't\nalways turn out well. And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island.\nIt isn't as if we were getting him from England or the States. He can't\nbe much different from ourselves.\"\n\"Well, I hope it will turn out all right,\" said Mrs. Rachel in a tone\nthat plainly indicated her painful doubts. \"Only don't say I didn't\nwarn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well--I\nheard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did\nthat and the whole family died in fearful agonies. Only, it was a girl\nin that instance.\"\n\"Well, we're not getting a girl,\" said Marilla, as if poisoning wells\nwere a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case\nof a boy. \"I'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up. I wonder at\nMrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it. But there, _she_ wouldn't shrink\nfrom adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head.\"\nMrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with his\nimported orphan. But reflecting that it would be a good two hours at\nleast before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to Robert\nBell's and tell the news. It would certainly make a sensation second\nto none, and Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to make a sensation. So she took\nherself away, somewhat to Marilla's relief, for the latter felt\nher doubts and fears reviving under the influence of Mrs. Rachel's\npessimism.",

She wore a faded brown\nsailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids\nof very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin,\nalso much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which\nlooked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.\nSo far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen\nthat the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes\nwere full of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped\nand expressive; that the forehead was broad and full; in short,\nour discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no\ncommonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom\nshy Matthew Cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid.\nMatthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon\nas she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with\none thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag;\nthe other she held out to him.\n\"I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?\" she said in\na peculiarly clear, sweet voice. \"I'm very glad to see you. I was\nbeginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me and I was imagining\nall the things that might have happened to prevent you.

She couldn't be left at Bright River anyhow, no\nmatter what mistake had been made, so all questions and explanations\nmight as well be deferred until he was safely back at Green Gables.\n\"I'm sorry I was late,\" he said shyly. \"Come along.

      "text": "I've got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn't heavy. And if it isn't\ncarried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so I'd better\nkeep it because I know the exact knack of it. It's an extremely old\ncarpet-bag. Oh, I'm very glad you've come, even if it would have been\nnice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. We've got to drive a long piece,\nhaven't we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. I'm glad because I\nlove driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I'm going to live with you\nand belong to you. I've never belonged to anybody--not really. But the\nasylum was the worst. I've only been in it four months, but that was\nenough. I don't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you\ncan't possibly understand what it is like. It's worse than anything you\ncould imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like\nthat, but I didn't mean to be wicked. It's so easy to be wicked without\nknowing it, isn't it? They were good, you know--the asylum people. But\nthere is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just\nin the other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about\nthem--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really\nthe daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents\nin her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. I\nused to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because\nI didn't have time in the day. I guess that's why I'm so thin--I _am_\ndreadful thin, ain't I? There isn't a pick on my bones. I do love to\nimagine I'm nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows.\"\nWith this Matthew's companion stopped talking, partly because she was\nout of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy. Not another\nword did she say until they had left the village and were driving down\na steep little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into\nthe soft soil, that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees\nand slim white birches, were several feet above their heads.\nThe child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that\nbrushed against the side of the buggy.\n\"Isn't that beautiful? What did that tree, leaning out from the bank,\nall white and lacy, make you think of?\" she asked.\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Why, a bride, of course--a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil.\nI've never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like. I don't\never expect to be a bride myself. I'm so homely nobody will ever want to\nmarry me--unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign\nmissionary mightn't be very particular. But I do hope that some day I\nshall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I\njust love pretty clothes. And I've never had a pretty dress in my life\nthat I can remember--but of course it's all the more to look forward\nto, isn't it? And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously. This\nmorning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear\nthis horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you\nknow. A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of\nwincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn't sell\nit, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart,\nwouldn't you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be\nlooking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that\nI had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you _are_\nimagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big\nhat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and\nboots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island\nwith all my might. I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither\nwas Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn't time\nto get sick, watching to see that I didn't fall overboard. She said she\nnever saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from\nbeing seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it? And I wanted to see\neverything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn't know\nwhether I'd ever have another opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more\ncherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just\nlove it already, and I'm so glad I'm going to live here. I've always\nheard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world,\nand I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I\nwould. It's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it?\nBut those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at\nCharlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer\nwhat made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not\nto ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand\nalready. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about\nthings if you don't ask questions? And what _does_ make the roads red?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn't it splendid\nto think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes\nme feel glad to be alive--it's such an interesting world. It wouldn't be\nhalf so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There'd\nbe no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I talking too\nmuch? People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I didn't\ntalk? If you say so I'll stop. I can _stop_ when I make up my mind to it,",

      "text": "although it's difficult.\"\nMatthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet\nfolks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking\nthemselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had\nnever expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad\nenough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the\nway they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if\nthey expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to\nsay a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But\nthis freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather\ndifficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental\nprocesses he thought that he \"kind of liked her chatter.\" So he said as\nshyly as usual:\n\"Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don't mind.\"\n\"Oh, I'm so glad. I know you and I are going to get along together\nfine. It's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told\nthat children should be seen and not heard. I've had that said to me a\nmillion times if I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big\nwords. But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express\nthem, haven't you?\"\n\"Well now, that seems reasonable,\" said Matthew.\n\"Mrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. But it\nisn't--it's firmly fastened at one end. Mrs. Spencer said your place was\nnamed Green Gables. I asked her all about it. And she said there were\ntrees all around it. I was gladder than ever. I just love trees. And\nthere weren't any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny\nthings out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them.\nThey just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did. It used to\nmake me want to cry to look at them. I used to say to them, 'Oh, you\n_poor_ little things! If you were out in a great big woods with other\ntrees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your\nroots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you\ncould grow, couldn't you? But you can't where you are. I know just\nexactly how you feel, little trees.' I felt sorry to leave them behind\nthis morning. You do get so attached to things like that, don't you? Is\nthere a brook anywhere near Green Gables? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer\nthat.\"\n\"Well now, yes, there's one right below the house.\"\n\"Fancy. It's always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I\nnever expected I would, though. Dreams don't often come true, do they?\nWouldn't it be nice if they did? But just now I feel pretty nearly\nperfectly happy. I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because--well,\nwhat color would you call this?\"\nShe twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and\nheld it up before Matthew's eyes. Matthew was not used to deciding on\nthe tints of ladies' tresses, but in this case there couldn't be much\ndoubt.\n\"It's red, ain't it?\" he said.\nThe girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from\nher very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.\n\"Yes, it's red,\" she said resignedly. \"Now you see why I can't be\nperfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don't mind the other\nthings so much--the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness. I\ncan imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf\ncomplexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I _cannot_ imagine that\nred hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, 'Now my hair is a\nglorious black, black as the raven's wing.' But all the time I _know_ it\nis just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong sorrow.\nI read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn't\nred hair. Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow.\nWhat is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell me?\"\n\"Well now, I'm afraid I can't,\" said Matthew, who was getting a little\ndizzy. He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy\nhad enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic.\n\"Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was\ndivinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be\ndivinely beautiful?\"\n\"Well now, no, I haven't,\" confessed Matthew ingenuously.\n\"I have, often. Which would you rather be if you had the\nchoice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?\"\n\"Well now, I--I don't know exactly.\"\n\"Neither do I. I can never decide. But it doesn't make much real\ndifference for it isn't likely I'll ever be either. It's certain I'll\nnever be angelically good. Mrs. Spencer says--oh, Mr. Cuthbert! Oh, Mr.\nCuthbert!! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!!!\"\nThat was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled\nout of the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing. They had\nsimply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the \"Avenue.\"\nThe \"Avenue,\" so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of road\nfour or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge,\nwide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old\nfarmer. Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom. Below the\nboughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse\nof painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a\ncathedral aisle.",

      "text": "Its beauty seemed to strike the child dumb. She leaned back in the\nbuggy, her thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to\nthe white splendor above. Even when they had passed out and were driving\ndown the long slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke. Still with\nrapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw\nvisions trooping splendidly across that glowing background. Through\nNewbridge, a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small\nboys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows, they drove, still\nin silence. When three more miles had dropped away behind them the child\nhad not spoken. She could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically\nas she could talk.\n\"I guess you're feeling pretty tired and hungry,\" Matthew ventured to\nsay at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the\nonly reason he could think of. \"But we haven't very far to go now--only\nanother mile.\"\nShe came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the\ndreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led.\n\"Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,\" she whispered, \"that place we came through--that\nwhite place--what was it?\"\n\"Well now, you must mean the Avenue,\" said Matthew after a few moments'\nprofound reflection. \"It is a kind of pretty place.\"\n\"Pretty? Oh, _pretty_ doesn't seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful,\neither. They don't go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful--wonderful.\nIt's the first thing I ever saw that couldn't be improved upon by\nimagination. It just satisfies me here\"--she put one hand on her\nbreast--\"it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache. Did\nyou ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?\"\n\"Well now, I just can't recollect that I ever had.\"\n\"I have it lots of time--whenever I see anything royally beautiful. But\nthey shouldn't call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning\nin a name like that. They should call it--let me see--the White Way of\nDelight. Isn't that a nice imaginative name? When I don't like the name\nof a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of\nthem so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins,\nbut I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that\nplace the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight.\nHave we really only another mile to go before we get home? I'm glad and\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I'm\nalways sorry when pleasant things end. Something still pleasanter may\ncome after, but you can never be sure. And it's so often the case that\nit isn't pleasanter. That has been my experience anyhow. But I'm glad to\nthink of getting home. You see, I've never had a real home since I can\nremember. It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming\nto a really truly home. Oh, isn't that pretty!\"\nThey had driven over the crest of a hill. Below them was a pond, looking\nalmost like a river so long and winding was it. A bridge spanned it\nmidway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of\nsand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a\nglory of many shifting hues--the most spiritual shadings of crocus and\nrose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name\nhas ever been found. Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing\ngroves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering\nshadows. Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a\nwhite-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection. From the marsh at the\nhead of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.\nThere was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on\na slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was\nshining from one of its windows.\n\"That's Barry's pond,\" said Matthew.\n\"Oh, I don't like that name, either. I shall call it--let me see--the\nLake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it. I know\nbecause of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives\nme a thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?\"\nMatthew ruminated.\n\"Well now, yes. It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly\nwhite grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. I hate the look of\nthem.\"\n\"Oh, I don't think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you\nthink it can? There doesn't seem to be much connection between grubs\nand lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it\nBarry's pond?\"\n\"I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house. Orchard\nSlope's the name of his place. If it wasn't for that big bush behind it\nyou could see Green Gables from here. But we have to go over the bridge\nand round by the road, so it's near half a mile further.\"\n\"Has Mr. Barry any little girls? Well, not so very little either--about\nmy size.\"\n\"He's got one about eleven. Her name is Diana.\"\n\"Oh!\" with a long indrawing of breath. \"What a perfectly lovely name!\"\n\"Well now, I dunno. There's something dreadful heathenish about it,\nseems to me. I'd ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that.\nBut when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they\ngave him the naming of her and he called her Diana.\"\n\"I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born,\nthen. Oh, here we are at the bridge. I'm going to shut my eyes tight.\nI'm always afraid going over bridges. I can't help imagining that\nperhaps just as we get to the middle, they'll crumple up like a\njack-knife and nip us. So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them\nfor all when I think we're getting near the middle. Because, you see, if\nthe bridge _did_ crumple up I'd want to _see_ it crumple. What a jolly\nrumble it makes! I always like the rumble part of it. Isn't it splendid\nthere are so many things to like in this world? There we're over. Now\nI'll look back. Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters. I always say\ngood night to the things I love, just as I would to people. I think they\nlike it. That water looks as if it was smiling at me.\"",

      "text": "When they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew\nsaid:\n\"We're pretty near home now. That's Green Gables over--\"\n\"Oh, don't tell me,\" she interrupted breathlessly, catching at his\npartially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his\ngesture. \"Let me guess. I'm sure I'll guess right.\"\nShe opened her eyes and looked about her. They were on the crest of a\nhill. The sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still\nclear in the mellow afterlight. To the west a dark church spire rose\nup against a marigold sky. Below was a little valley and beyond a long,\ngently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it. From one\nto another the child's eyes darted, eager and wistful. At last they\nlingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white\nwith blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods. Over it,\nin the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining\nlike a lamp of guidance and promise.\n\"That's it, isn't it?\" she said, pointing.\nMatthew slapped the reins on the sorrel's back delightedly.\n\"Well now, you've guessed it! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it\nso's you could tell.\"\n\"No, she didn't--really she didn't. All she said might just as well have\nbeen about most of those other places. I hadn't any real idea what it\nlooked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home. Oh, it\nseems as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and\nblue from the elbow up, for I've pinched myself so many times today.\nEvery little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and\nI'd be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I'd pinch myself to see if it\nwas real--until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only\na dream I'd better go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped\npinching. But it _is_ real and we're nearly home.\"\nWith a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred\nuneasily. He felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he who would\nhave to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was\nnot to be hers after all. They drove over Lynde's Hollow, where it was\nalready quite dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them\nfrom her window vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green\nGables. By the time they arrived at the house Matthew was shrinking from\nthe approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand. It was\nnot of Marilla or himself he was thinking or of the trouble this mistake\nwas probably going to make for them, but of the child's disappointment.\nWhen he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had\nan uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering\nsomething--much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill\na lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature.\nThe yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves\nwere rustling silkily all round it.\n\"Listen to the trees talking in their sleep,\" she whispered, as he\nlifted her to the ground. \"What nice dreams they must have!\"\nThen, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained \"all her worldly\ngoods,\" she followed him into the house.",

      "text": "MARILLA came briskly forward as Matthew opened the door. But when her\neyes fell on the odd little figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the\nlong braids of red hair and the eager, luminous eyes, she stopped short\nin amazement.\n\"Matthew Cuthbert, who's that?\" she ejaculated. \"Where is the boy?\"\n\"There wasn't any boy,\" said Matthew wretchedly. \"There was only _her_.\"\nHe nodded at the child, remembering that he had never even asked her\nname.\n\"No boy! But there _must_ have been a boy,\" insisted Marilla. \"We sent\nword to Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy.\"\n\"Well, she didn't. She brought _her_. I asked the station-master. And I\nhad to bring her home. She couldn't be left there, no matter where the\nmistake had come in.\"\n\"Well, this is a pretty piece of business!\" ejaculated Marilla.\nDuring this dialogue the child had remained silent, her eyes roving from\none to the other, all the animation fading out of her face. Suddenly\nshe seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said. Dropping her\nprecious carpet-bag she sprang forward a step and clasped her hands.\n\"You don't want me!\" she cried. \"You don't want me because I'm not a\nboy! I might have expected it. Nobody ever did want me. I might have\nknown it was all too beautiful to last. I might have known nobody really\ndid want me. Oh, what shall I do? I'm going to burst into tears!\"\nBurst into tears she did. Sitting down on a chair by the table, flinging\nher arms out upon it, and burying her face in them, she proceeded to cry\nstormily. Marilla and Matthew looked at each other deprecatingly across\nthe stove. Neither of them knew what to say or do. Finally Marilla\nstepped lamely into the breach.\n\"Well, well, there's no need to cry so about it.\"\n\"Yes, there _is_ need!\" The child raised her head quickly, revealing a\ntear-stained face and trembling lips. \"_You_ would cry, too, if you were\nan orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and\nfound that they didn't want you because you weren't a boy. Oh, this is\nthe most _tragical_ thing that ever happened to me!\"\nSomething like a reluctant smile, rather rusty from long disuse,\nmellowed Marilla's grim expression.\n\"Well, don't cry any more. We're not going to turn you out-of-doors\nto-night. You'll have to stay here until we investigate this affair.\nWhat's your name?\"\nThe child hesitated for a moment.\n\"Will you please call me Cordelia?\" she said eagerly.\n\"_Call_ you Cordelia? Is that your name?\"\n\"No-o-o, it's not exactly my name, but I would love to be called\nCordelia. It's such a perfectly elegant name.\"\n\"I don't know what on earth you mean. If Cordelia isn't your name, what\nis?\"\n\"Anne Shirley,\" reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name, \"but,\noh, please do call me Cordelia. It can't matter much to you what you\ncall me if I'm only going to be here a little while, can it? And Anne is\nsuch an unromantic name.\"\n\"Unromantic fiddlesticks!\" said the unsympathetic Marilla. \"Anne is a\nreal good plain sensible name. You've no need to be ashamed of it.\"\n\"Oh, I'm not ashamed of it,\" explained Anne, \"only I like Cordelia\nbetter. I've always imagined that my name was Cordelia--at least, I\nalways have of late years. When I was young I used to imagine it was\nGeraldine, but I like Cordelia better now. But if you call me Anne\nplease call me Anne spelled with an E.\"\n\"What difference does it make how it's spelled?\" asked Marilla with\nanother rusty smile as she picked up the teapot.\n\"Oh, it makes _such_ a difference. It _looks_ so much nicer. When you hear\na name pronounced can't you always see it in your mind, just as if it\nwas printed out? I can; and A-n-n looks dreadful, but A-n-n-e looks so\nmuch more distinguished. If you'll only call me Anne spelled with an E I\nshall try to reconcile myself to not being called Cordelia.\"\n\"Very well, then, Anne spelled with an E, can you tell us how this\nmistake came to be made? We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy.\nWere there no boys at the asylum?\"\n\"Oh, yes, there was an abundance of them. But Mrs. Spencer said\n_distinctly_ that you wanted a girl about eleven years old. And the\nmatron said she thought I would do. You don't know how delighted I was.\nI couldn't sleep all last night for joy. Oh,\" she added reproachfully,\nturning to Matthew, \"why didn't you tell me at the station that you\ndidn't want me and leave me there? If I hadn't seen the White Way of\nDelight and the Lake of Shining Waters it wouldn't be so hard.\"\n\"What on earth does she mean?\" demanded Marilla, staring at Matthew.\n\"She--she's just referring to some conversation we had on the road,\"\nsaid Matthew hastily. \"I'm going out to put the mare in, Marilla. Have\ntea ready when I come back.\"\n\"Did Mrs. Spencer bring anybody over besides you?\" continued Marilla\nwhen Matthew had gone out.\n\"She brought Lily Jones for herself. Lily is only five years old and she\nis very beautiful and had nut-brown hair. If I was very beautiful and\nhad nut-brown hair would you keep me?\"\n\"No. We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A girl would be of\nno use to us. Take off your hat. I'll lay it and your bag on the hall\ntable.\"\nAnne took off her hat meekly. Matthew came back presently and they sat\ndown to supper. But Anne could not eat. In vain she nibbled at the\nbread and butter and pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little\nscalloped glass dish by her plate. She did not really make any headway\nat all.\n\"You're not eating anything,\" said Marilla sharply, eying her as if it\nwere a serious shortcoming. Anne sighed.\n\"I can't. I'm in the depths of despair. Can you eat when you are in the\ndepths of despair?\"\n\"I've never been in the depths of despair, so I can't say,\" responded\nMarilla.\n\"Weren't you? Well, did you ever try to _imagine_ you were in the depths\nof despair?\"\n\"No, I didn't.\"\n\"Then I don't think you can understand what it's like. It's a very\nuncomfortable feeling indeed. When you try to eat a lump comes right\nup in your throat and you can't swallow anything, not even if it was a\nchocolate caramel. I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it\nwas simply delicious. I've often dreamed since then that I had a lot\nof chocolate caramels, but I always wake up just when I'm going to eat\nthem. I do hope you won't be offended because I can't eat. Everything is\nextremely nice, but still I cannot eat.\"\n\"I guess she's tired,\" said Matthew, who hadn't spoken since his return\nfrom the barn. \"Best put her to bed, Marilla.\"\nMarilla had been wondering where Anne should be put to bed. She had\nprepared a couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected\nboy. But, although it was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the\nthing to put a girl there somehow. But the spare room was out of the\nquestion for such a stray waif, so there remained only the east gable\nroom. Marilla lighted a candle and told Anne to follow her, which Anne\nspiritlessly did, taking her hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as\nshe passed. The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in\nwhich she presently found herself seemed still cleaner.\nMarilla set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and\nturned down the bedclothes.\n\"I suppose you have a nightgown?\" she questioned.\nAnne nodded.\n\"Yes, I have two. The matron of the asylum made them for me. They're\nfearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so\nthings are always skimpy--at least in a poor asylum like ours. I hate\nskimpy night-dresses. But one can dream just as well in them as\nin lovely trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that's one\nconsolation.\"\n\"Well, undress as quick as you can and go to bed. I'll come back in a\nfew minutes for the candle. I daren't trust you to put it out yourself.\nYou'd likely set the place on fire.\"\nWhen Marilla had gone Anne looked around her wistfully. The whitewashed\nwalls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache\nover their own bareness. The floor was bare, too, except for a round\nbraided mat in the middle such as Anne had never seen before. In\none corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark,\nlow-turned posts. In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner\ntable adorned with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the\npoint of the most adventurous pin. Above it hung a little six-by-eight\nmirror. Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white\nmuslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The whole\napartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which\nsent a shiver to the very marrow of Anne's bones. With a sob she hastily\ndiscarded her garments, put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed\nwhere she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes\nover her head. When Marilla came up for the light various skimpy\narticles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain\ntempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any\npresence save her own.\nShe deliberately picked up Anne's clothes, placed them neatly on a prim\nyellow chair, and then, taking up the candle, went over to the bed.\n\"Good night,\" she said, a little awkwardly, but not unkindly.\nAnne's white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a\nstartling suddenness.\n\"How can you call it a _good_ night when you know it must be the very\nworst night I've ever had?\" she said reproachfully.\nThen she dived down into invisibility again.\nMarilla went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper\ndishes. Matthew was smoking--a sure sign of perturbation of mind. He\nseldom smoked, for Marilla set her face against it as a filthy habit;\nbut at certain times and seasons he felt driven to it and them Marilla\nwinked at the practice, realizing that a mere man must have some vent\nfor his emotions.\n\"Well, this is a pretty kettle of fish,\" she said wrathfully. \"This is\nwhat comes of sending word instead of going ourselves. Richard Spencer's\nfolks have twisted that message somehow. One of us will have to drive\nover and see Mrs. Spencer tomorrow, that's certain. This girl will have\nto be sent back to the asylum.\"\n\"Yes, I suppose so,\" said Matthew reluctantly.\n\"You _suppose_ so! Don't you know it?\"\n\"Well now, she's a real nice little thing, Marilla. It's kind of a pity\nto send her back when she's so set on staying here.\"\n\"Matthew Cuthbert, you don't mean to say you think we ought to keep\nher!\"\nMarilla's astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had\nexpressed a predilection for standing on his head.\n\"Well, now, no, I suppose not--not exactly,\" stammered Matthew,\nuncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. \"I\nsuppose--we could hardly be expected to keep her.\"\n\"I should say not. What good would she be to us?\"\n\"We might be some good to her,\" said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.\n\"Matthew Cuthbert, I believe that child has bewitched you! I can see as\nplain as plain that you want to keep her.\"\n\"Well now, she's a real interesting little thing,\" persisted Matthew.\n\"You should have heard her talk coming from the station.\"\n\"Oh, she can talk fast enough. I saw that at once. It's nothing in her\nfavour, either. I don't like children who have so much to say. I don't\nwant an orphan girl and if I did she isn't the style I'd pick out.\nThere's something I don't understand about her. No, she's got to be\ndespatched straight-way back to where she came from.\"\n\"I could hire a French boy to help me,\" said Matthew, \"and she'd be\ncompany for you.\"\n\"I'm not suffering for company,\" said Marilla shortly. \"And I'm not\ngoing to keep her.\"\n\"Well now, it's just as you say, of course, Marilla,\" said Matthew\nrising and putting his pipe away. \"I'm going to bed.\"\nTo bed went Matthew. And to bed, when she had put her dishes away, went\nMarilla, frowning most resolutely. And up-stairs, in the east gable, a",

First came a\ndelightful thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible\nremembrance. This was Green Gables and they didn't want her because she\nwasn't a boy!\nBut it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside\nof her window. With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor.\nShe pushed up the sash--it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn't\nbeen opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight\nthat nothing was needed to hold it up.\nAnne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning, her eyes\nglistening with delight. Oh, wasn't it beautiful? Wasn't it a lovely\nplace? Suppose she wasn't really going to stay here! She would imagine\nshe was. There was scope for imagination here.\nA huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against\nthe house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf\nwas to be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of\napple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms;\nand their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below\nwere lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance\ndrifted up to the window on the morning wind.\nBelow the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the\nhollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew,\nupspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful\npossibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally. Beyond it\nwas a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in\nit where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the\nother side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible.\nOff to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over\ngreen, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.\nAnne's beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily\nin. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child;\nbut this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.\nShe knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until\nshe was startled by a hand on her shoulder.

Isn't it a\nsplendid thing that there are mornings? But I feel very sad. I've just\nbeen imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was\nto stay here for ever and ever. It was a great comfort while it lasted.\nBut the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have\nto stop and that hurts.\"\n\"You'd better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your\nimaginings,\" said Marilla as soon as she could get a word in edgewise.\n\"Breakfast is waiting. Wash your face and comb your hair. Leave the\nwindow up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed. Be as\nsmart as you can.\"\nAnne could evidently be smart to some purpose for she was down-stairs\nin ten minutes' time, with her clothes neatly on, her hair brushed and\nbraided, her face washed, and a comfortable consciousness pervading her\nsoul that she had fulfilled all Marilla's requirements. As a matter of\nfact, however, she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes.\n\"I'm pretty hungry this morning,\" she announced as she slipped into the\nchair Marilla placed for her. \"The world doesn't seem such a howling\nwilderness as it did last night. I'm so glad it's a sunshiny morning.\nBut I like rainy mornings real well, too. All sorts of mornings are\ninteresting, don't you think? You don't know what's going to happen\nthrough the day, and there's so much scope for imagination. But I'm\nglad it's not rainy today because it's easier to be cheerful and bear\nup under affliction on a sunshiny day. I feel that I have a good deal\nto bear up under. It's all very well to read about sorrows and imagine\nyourself living through them heroically, but it's not so nice when you\nreally come to have them, is it?\"\n\"For pity's sake hold your tongue,\" said Marilla. \"You talk entirely too\nmuch for a little girl.\"\nThereupon Anne held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her\ncontinued silence made Marilla rather nervous, as if in the presence of\nsomething not exactly natural. Matthew also held his tongue,--but this\nwas natural,--so that the meal was a very silent one.\nAs it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating\nmechanically, with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the\nsky outside the window. This made Marilla more nervous than ever; she\nhad an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child's body might\nbe there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy\ncloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination. Who would want such\na child about the place?",

You'll come with me and we'll settle what's to be\ndone with you. After you've finished the dishes go up-stairs and make\nyour bed.\"\nAnne washed the dishes deftly enough, as Marilla who kept a sharp eye on\nthe process, discerned. Later on she made her bed less successfully, for\nshe had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick.

And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those\ntrees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I'll not be able to help\nloving it. It's hard enough now, so I won't make it any harder.

Just you stick to bald facts.\nBegin at the beginning. Where were you born and how old are you?\"\n\"I was eleven last March,\" said Anne, resigning herself to bald facts\nwith a little sigh. \"And I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.\nMy father's name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the\nBolingbroke High School. My mother's name was Bertha Shirley. Aren't\nWalter and Bertha lovely names? I'm so glad my parents had nice names.\nIt would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\"I guess it doesn't matter what a person's name is as long as he behaves\nhimself,\" said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good\nand useful moral.\n\"Well, I don't know.\" Anne looked thoughtful. \"I read in a book once\nthat a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've never been\nable to believe it. I don't believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was\ncalled a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been\na good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but I'm sure it would\nhave been a cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school,\ntoo, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A\nhusband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were\na pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a\nweeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. I've never seen that\nhouse, but I've imagined it thousands of times. I think it must have\nhad honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and\nlilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in\nall the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born\nin that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I\nwas so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I\nwas perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge\nthan a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn't you? I'm glad she\nwas satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a\ndisappointment to her--because she didn't live very long after that, you",

But she had\nheard of her. \"A terrible worker and driver,\" Mrs. Peter was said to\nbe; and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and\nstinginess, and her family of pert, quarrelsome children. Marilla felt\na qualm of conscience at the thought of handing Anne over to her tender\nmercies.\n\"Well, I'll go in and we'll talk the matter over,\" she said.\n\"And if there isn't Mrs. Peter coming up the lane this blessed minute!\"\nexclaimed Mrs. Spencer, bustling her guests through the hall into the\nparlor, where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been\nstrained so long through dark green, closely drawn blinds that it had\nlost every particle of warmth it had ever possessed. \"That is real\nlucky, for we can settle the matter right away. Take the armchair, Miss\nCuthbert. Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don't wiggle. Let\nme take your hats. Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on. Good\nafternoon, Mrs. Blewett. We were just saying how fortunate it was you\nhappened along. Let me introduce you two ladies. Mrs. Blewett, Miss\nCuthbert. Please excuse me for just a moment. I forgot to tell Flora\nJane to take the buns out of the oven.\"\nMrs. Spencer whisked away, after pulling up the blinds. Anne sitting\nmutely on the ottoman, with her hands clasped tightly in her lap, stared\nat Mrs Blewett as one fascinated. Was she to be given into the keeping\nof this sharp-faced, sharp-eyed woman? She felt a lump coming up in her\nthroat and her eyes smarted painfully. She was beginning to be afraid\nshe couldn't keep the tears back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed\nand beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical,\nmental or spiritual, into consideration and settling it out of hand.\n\"It seems there's been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs. Blewett,\"\nshe said. \"I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted\na little girl to adopt. I was certainly told so. But it seems it was a\nboy they wanted. So if you're still of the same mind you were yesterday,\nI think she'll be just the thing for you.\"\nMrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.\n\"How old are you and what's your name?\" she demanded.\n\"Anne Shirley,\" faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make any\nstipulations regarding the spelling thereof, \"and I'm eleven years old.\"\n\"Humph! You don't look as if there was much to you. But you're wiry. I\ndon't know but the wiry ones are the best after all. Well, if I take you\nyou'll have to be a good girl, you know--good and smart and respectful.\nI'll expect you to earn your keep, and no mistake about that. Yes, I\nsuppose I might as well take her off your hands, Miss Cuthbert. The\nbaby's awful fractious, and I'm clean worn out attending to him. If you\nlike I can take her right home now.\"\nMarilla looked at Anne and softened at sight of the child's pale face\nwith its look of mute misery--the misery of a helpless little creature\nwho finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.\nMarilla felt an uncomfortable conviction that, if she denied the appeal\nof that look, it would haunt her to her dying day. More-over, she did\nnot fancy Mrs. Blewett. To hand a sensitive, \"highstrung\" child over to\nsuch a woman! No, she could not take the responsibility of doing that!\n\"Well, I don't know,\" she said slowly. \"I didn't say that Matthew and I\nhad absolutely decided that we wouldn't keep her. In fact I may say that\nMatthew is disposed to keep her. I just came over to find out how the\nmistake had occurred. I think I'd better take her home again and talk it\nover with Matthew. I feel that I oughtn't to decide on anything without\nconsulting him. If we make up our mind not to keep her we'll bring or\nsend her over to you tomorrow night. If we don't you may know that she\nis going to stay with us. Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?\"",

But she said\nnothing, to him, relative to the affair, until they were both out in the\nyard behind the barn milking the cows. Then she briefly told him Anne's\nhistory and the result of the interview with Mrs. Spencer.\n\"I wouldn't give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman,\" said Matthew with\nunusual vim.\n\"I don't fancy her style myself,\" admitted Marilla, \"but it's that\nor keeping her ourselves, Matthew. And since you seem to want her, I\nsuppose I'm willing--or have to be. I've been thinking over the idea\nuntil I've got kind of used to it. It seems a sort of duty. I've never\nbrought up a child, especially a girl, and I dare say I'll make a\nterrible mess of it. But I'll do my best. So far as I'm concerned,\nMatthew, she may stay.\"\nMatthew's shy face was a glow of delight.\n\"Well now, I reckoned you'd come to see it in that light, Marilla,\" he\nsaid. \"She's such an interesting little thing.\"\n\"It'd be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little\nthing,\" retorted Marilla, \"but I'll make it my business to see she's\ntrained to be that. And mind, Matthew, you're not to go interfering with\nmy methods. Perhaps an old maid doesn't know much about bringing up\na child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor. So you just\nleave me to manage her. When I fail it'll be time enough to put your oar\nin.\"\n\"There, there, Marilla, you can have your own way,\" said Matthew\nreassuringly. \"Only be as good and kind to her as you can without\nspoiling her. I kind of think she's one of the sort you can do anything\nwith if you only get her to love you.\"\nMarilla sniffed, to express her contempt for Matthew's opinions\nconcerning anything feminine, and walked off to the dairy with the\npails.\n\"I won't tell her tonight that she can stay,\" she reflected, as she\nstrained the milk into the creamers. \"She'd be so excited that she\nwouldn't sleep a wink. Marilla Cuthbert, you're fairly in for it. Did\nyou ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan\ngirl? It's surprising enough; but not so surprising as that Matthew\nshould be at the bottom of it, him that always seemed to have such a\nmortal dread of little girls. Anyhow, we've decided on the experiment\nand goodness only knows what will come of it.\"",

That is a very untidy habit, and I\ncan't allow it at all. As soon as you take off any article of clothing\nfold it neatly and place it on the chair. I haven't any use at all for\nlittle girls who aren't neat.\"\n\"I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn't think about my\nclothes at all,\" said Anne. \"I'll fold them nicely tonight. They always\nmade us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though, I'd forget, I'd be\nin such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things.\"\n\"You'll have to remember a little better if you stay here,\" admonished\nMarilla. \"There, that looks something like. Say your prayers now and get\ninto bed.\"\n\"I never say any prayers,\" announced Anne.\nMarilla looked horrified astonishment.\n\"Why, Anne, what do you mean? Were you never taught to say your prayers?\nGod always wants little girls to say their prayers. Don't you know who\nGod is, Anne?\"\n\"'God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable, in His being,\nwisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth,'\" responded Anne\npromptly and glibly.\nMarilla looked rather relieved.\n\"So you do know something then, thank goodness! You're not quite a\nheathen. Where did you learn that?\"\n\"Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole\ncatechism. I liked it pretty well. There's something splendid about some\nof the words. 'Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.' Isn't that grand? It\nhas such a roll to it--just like a big organ playing. You couldn't quite\ncall it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn't it?\"\n\"We're not talking about poetry, Anne--we are talking about saying your\nprayers. Don't you know it's a terrible wicked thing not to say your\nprayers every night? I'm afraid you are a very bad little girl.\"\n\"You'd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,\" said\nAnne reproachfully. \"People who haven't red hair don't know what trouble\nis. Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red _on purpose_, and I've\nnever cared about Him since. And anyhow I'd always be too tired at night\nto bother saying prayers. People who have to look after twins can't be\nexpected to say their prayers. Now, do you honestly think they can?\"\nMarilla decided that Anne's religious training must be begun at once.\nPlainly there was no time to be lost.\n\"You must say your prayers while you are under my roof, Anne.\"\n\"Why, of course, if you want me to,\" assented Anne cheerfully. \"I'd do\nanything to oblige you. But you'll have to tell me what to say for this\nonce. After I get into bed I'll imagine out a real nice prayer to say\nalways. I believe that it will be quite interesting, now that I come to\nthink of it.\"\n\"You must kneel down,\" said Marilla in embarrassment.\nAnne knelt at Marilla's knee and looked up gravely.\n\"Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I'll\ntell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone\nor into the deep, deep, woods, and I'd look up into the\nsky--up--up--up--into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no\nend to its blueness. And then I'd just _feel_ a prayer. Well, I'm ready.\nWhat am I to say?\"\nMarilla felt more embarrassed than ever. She had intended to teach Anne\nthe childish classic, \"Now I lay me down to sleep.\" But she had, as\nI have told you, the glimmerings of a sense of humor--which is simply\nanother name for a sense of fitness of things; and it suddenly occurred\nto her that that simple little prayer, sacred to white-robed childhood\nlisping at motherly knees, was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch\nof a girl who knew and cared nothing about God's love, since she had\nnever had it translated to her through the medium of human love.\n\"You're old enough to pray for yourself, Anne,\" she said finally. \"Just\nthank God for your blessings and ask Him humbly for the things you\nwant.\"\n\"Well, I'll do my best,\" promised Anne, burying her face in Marilla's\nlap. \"Gracious heavenly Father--that's the way the ministers say it in\nchurch, so I suppose it's all right in private prayer, isn't it?\" she\ninterjected, lifting her head for a moment. \"Gracious heavenly Father,\nI thank Thee for the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining\nWaters and Bonny and the Snow Queen. I'm really extremely grateful for\nthem. And that's all the blessings I can think of just now to thank\nThee for. As for the things I want, they're so numerous that it would\ntake a great deal of time to name them all so I will only mention the\ntwo most important. Please let me stay at Green Gables; and please let\nme be good-looking when I grow up. I remain,\n\"Yours respectfully,\nAnne Shirley.\n\"There, did I do all right?\" she asked eagerly, getting up. \"I could\nhave made it much more flowery if I'd had a little more time to think it\nover.\"\nPoor Marilla was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering\nthat it was not irreverence, but simply spiritual ignorance on the part\nof Anne that was responsible for this extraordinary petition. She tucked\nthe child up in bed, mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer\nthe very next day, and was leaving the room with the light when Anne\ncalled her back.\n\"I've just thought of it now. I should have said, 'Amen' in place\nof 'yours respectfully,' shouldn't I?--the way the ministers do. I'd\nforgotten it, but I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way, so\nI put in the other. Do you suppose it will make any difference?\"\n\"I--I don't suppose it will,\" said Marilla. \"Go to sleep now like a good\nchild. Good night.\"\n\"I can only say good night tonight with a clear conscience,\" said Anne,\ncuddling luxuriously down among her pillows.\nMarilla retreated to the kitchen, set the candle firmly on the table,\nand glared at Matthew.\n\"Matthew Cuthbert, it's about time somebody adopted that child and\ntaught her something. She's next door to a perfect heathen. Will you\nbelieve that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight? I'll send\nher to the manse tomorrow and borrow the Peep of the Day series, that's\nwhat I'll do. And she shall go to Sunday-school just as soon as I can\nget some suitable clothes made for her. I foresee that I shall have\nmy hands full. Well, well, we can't get through this world without our\nshare of trouble. I've had a pretty easy life of it so far, but my time\nhas come at last and I suppose I'll just have to make the best of it.\"",

During the\nforenoon she kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her\nwith a keen eye while she did them. By noon she had concluded that Anne\nwas smart and obedient, willing to work and quick to learn; her most\nserious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in\nthe middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was\nsharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe.\nWhen Anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted\nMarilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to\nlearn the worst. Her thin little body trembled from head to foot; her\nface flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black; she\nclasped her hands tightly and said in an imploring voice:\n\"Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won't you tell me if you are going to send\nme away or not? I've tried to be patient all the morning, but I really\nfeel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It's a dreadful feeling.\nPlease tell me.\"\n\"You haven't scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to\ndo,\" said Marilla immovably. \"Just go and do it before you ask any more\nquestions, Anne.\"\nAnne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she returned to Marilla\nand fastened imploring eyes of the latter's face. \"Well,\" said Marilla,\nunable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer, \"I\nsuppose I might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep\nyou--that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself\ngrateful. Why, child, whatever is the matter?\"\n\"I'm crying,\" said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. \"I can't think why.\nI'm glad as glad can be. Oh, _glad_ doesn't seem the right word at all. I\nwas glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms--but this! Oh, it's\nsomething more than glad. I'm so happy. I'll try to be so good. It\nwill be uphill work, I expect, for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was\ndesperately wicked. However, I'll do my very best. But can you tell me\nwhy I'm crying?\"\n\"I suppose it's because you're all excited and worked up,\" said Marilla\ndisapprovingly. \"Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself. I'm\nafraid you both cry and laugh far too easily. Yes, you can stay here and\nwe will try to do right by you. You must go to school; but it's only a",

I'm not used to being called\nMiss Cuthbert and it would make me nervous.\"\n\"It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla,\" protested Anne.\n\"I guess there'll be nothing disrespectful in it if you're careful\nto speak respectfully.

You couldn't really expect a person\nto pray very well the first time she tried, could you? I thought out a\nsplendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would.\nIt was nearly as long as a minister's and so poetical. But would you\nbelieve it? I couldn't remember one word when I woke up this morning.\nAnd I'm afraid I'll never be able to think out another one as good.\nSomehow, things never are so good when they're thought out a second\ntime. Have you ever noticed that?\"\n\"Here is something for you to notice, Anne. When I tell you to do\na thing I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and\ndiscourse about it. Just you go and do as I bid you.\"\nAnne promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall; she failed\nto return; after waiting ten minutes Marilla laid down her knitting\nand marched after her with a grim expression. She found Anne standing\nmotionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows,\nwith her eyes a-star with dreams. The white and green light strained\nthrough apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt\nlittle figure with a half-unearthly radiance.\n\"Anne, whatever are you thinking of?\" demanded Marilla sharply.\nAnne came back to earth with a start.\n\"That,\" she said, pointing to the picture--a rather vivid chromo\nentitled, \"Christ Blessing Little Children\"--\"and I was just imagining I\nwas one of them--that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing\noff by herself in the corner as if she didn't belong to anybody, like\nme. She looks lonely and sad, don't you think? I guess she hadn't any\nfather or mother of her own. But she wanted to be blessed, too, so she\njust crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody would\nnotice her--except Him. I'm sure I know just how she felt. Her heart\nmust have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when I\nasked you if I could stay. She was afraid He mightn't notice her. But\nit's likely He did, don't you think? I've been trying to imagine it all\nout--her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite close\nto Him; and then He would look at her and put His hand on her hair and\noh, such a thrill of joy as would run over her! But I wish the artist\nhadn't painted Him so sorrowful looking. All His pictures are like that,\nif you've noticed. But I don't believe He could really have looked so\nsad or the children would have been afraid of Him.\"\n\"Anne,\" said Marilla, wondering why she had not broken into this speech\nlong before, \"you shouldn't talk that way. It's irreverent--positively\nirreverent.\"\nAnne's eyes marveled.\n\"Why, I felt just as reverent as could be. I'm sure I didn't mean to be\nirreverent.\"\n\"Well I don't suppose you did--but it doesn't sound right to talk so\nfamiliarly about such things. And another thing, Anne, when I send you\nafter something you're to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and\nimagining before pictures. Remember that. Take that card and come right",

Now, sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by\nheart.\"\nAnne set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she had\nbrought in to decorate the dinner-table--Marilla had eyed that\ndecoration askance, but had said nothing--propped her chin on her hands,\nand fell to studying it intently for several silent minutes.\n\"I like this,\" she announced at length. \"It's beautiful. I've heard it\nbefore--I heard the superintendent of the asylum Sunday school say it\nover once. But I didn't like it then. He had such a cracked voice and\nhe prayed it so mournfully. I really felt sure he thought praying was a\ndisagreeable duty. This isn't poetry, but it makes me feel just the same\nway poetry does. 'Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name.'\nThat is just like a line of music. Oh, I'm so glad you thought of making\nme learn this, Miss--Marilla.\"\n\"Well, learn it and hold your tongue,\" said Marilla shortly.\nAnne tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft\nkiss on a pink-cupped bud, and then studied diligently for some moments\nlonger.\n\"Marilla,\" she demanded presently, \"do you think that I shall ever have\na bosom friend in Avonlea?\"\n\"A--a what kind of friend?\"\n\"A bosom friend--an intimate friend, you know--a really kindred spirit\nto whom I can confide my inmost soul. I've dreamed of meeting her all\nmy life. I never really supposed I would, but so many of my loveliest\ndreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. Do\nyou think it's possible?\"\n\"Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she's about your age. She's\na very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when\nshe comes home. She's visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now. You'll\nhave to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is a\nvery particular woman. She won't let Diana play with any little girl who\nisn't nice and good.\"\nAnne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with\ninterest.\n\"What is Diana like? Her hair isn't red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It's bad\nenough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn't endure it in a\nbosom friend.\"\n\"Diana is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and\nrosy cheeks. And she is good and smart, which is better than being\npretty.\"\nMarilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was\nfirmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a\nchild who was being brought up.\nBut Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the\ndelightful possibilities before it.\n\"Oh, I'm so glad she's pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself--and\nthat's impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom\nfriend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting\nroom with glass doors. There weren't any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept\nher best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to\nkeep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night\nwhen he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to\npretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in\nit. I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to\ntalk to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything.\nKatie was the comfort and consolation of my life. We used to pretend\nthat the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I\ncould open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice\nlived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas' shelves of preserves and china. And\nthen Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a\nwonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have\nlived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond\nit just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully,\ntoo, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye\nthrough the bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond's. But\njust up the river a little way from the house there was a long green\nlittle valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every\nword you said, even if you didn't talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it\nwas a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved\nher almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you\nknow. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta,\nand oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had\nbecome so attached to her that I hadn't the heart to imagine a bosom\nfriend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination\nthere.\"\n\"I think it's just as well there wasn't,\" said Marilla drily. \"I\ndon't approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe your own\nimaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to\nput such nonsense out of your head. But don't let Mrs. Barry hear you\ntalking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she'll think you\ntell stories.\"\n\"Oh, I won't. I couldn't talk of them to everybody--their memories are\ntoo sacred for that. But I thought I'd like to have you know about them.\nOh, look, here's a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom. Just\nthink what a lovely place to live--in an apple blossom! Fancy going to\nsleep in it when the wind was rocking it. If I wasn't a human girl I\nthink I'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers.\"\n\"Yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull,\" sniffed Marilla. \"I think you\nare very fickle minded. I told you to learn that prayer and not talk.\nBut it seems impossible for you to stop talking if you've got anybody\nthat will listen to you. So go up to your room and learn it.\"\n\"Oh, I know it pretty nearly all now--all but just the last line.\"\n\"Well, never mind, do as I tell you. Go to your room and finish learning\nit well, and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea.\"\n\"Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?\" pleaded Anne.\n\"No; you don't want your room cluttered up with flowers. You should have\nleft them on the tree in the first place.\"\n\"I did feel a little that way, too,\" said Anne. \"I kind of felt I\nshouldn't shorten their lovely lives by picking them--I wouldn't want\nto be picked if I were an apple blossom. But the temptation was\n_irresistible_. What do you do when you meet with an irresistible\ntemptation?\"\n\"Anne, did you hear me tell you to go to your room?\"\nAnne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the\nwindow.\n\"There--I know this prayer. I learned that last sentence coming\nupstairs. Now I'm going to imagine things into this room so that they'll\nalways stay imagined. The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet\nwith pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the\nwindows. The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry. The\nfurniture is mahogany. I never saw any mahogany, but it does sound _so_\nluxurious. This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions,\npink and blue and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it.\nI can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall.\nI am tall and regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a\npearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair. My hair is of midnight\ndarkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor. My name is the Lady\nCordelia Fitzgerald. No, it isn't--I can't make _that_ seem real.\"\nShe danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it. Her\npointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.\n\"You're only Anne of Green Gables,\" she said earnestly, \"and I see you,\njust as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I'm the Lady\nCordelia. But it's a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than\nAnne of nowhere in particular, isn't it?\"\nShe bent forward, kissed her reflection affectionately, and betook\nherself to the open window.\n\"Dear Snow Queen, good afternoon. And good afternoon dear birches down\nin the hollow. And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill. I\nwonder if Diana is to be my bosom friend. I hope she will, and I shall\nlove her very much. But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice\nand Violetta. They would feel so hurt if I did and I'd hate to hurt\nanybody's feelings, even a little bookcase girl's or a little echo\ngirl's. I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every\nday.\"",

      "text": "ANNE had been a fortnight at Green Gables before Mrs. Lynde arrived to\ninspect her. Mrs. Rachel, to do her justice, was not to blame for this.\nA severe and unseasonable attack of grippe had confined that good lady\nto her house ever since the occasion of her last visit to Green Gables.\nMrs. Rachel was not often sick and had a well-defined contempt for\npeople who were; but grippe, she asserted, was like no other illness on\nearth and could only be interpreted as one of the special visitations\nof Providence. As soon as her doctor allowed her to put her foot\nout-of-doors she hurried up to Green Gables, bursting with curiosity to\nsee Matthew and Marilla's orphan, concerning whom all sorts of stories\nand suppositions had gone abroad in Avonlea.\nAnne had made good use of every waking moment of that fortnight. Already\nshe was acquainted with every tree and shrub about the place. She had\ndiscovered that a lane opened out below the apple orchard and ran up\nthrough a belt of woodland; and she had explored it to its furthest end\nin all its delicious vagaries of brook and bridge, fir coppice and wild\ncherry arch, corners thick with fern, and branching byways of maple and\nmountain ash.\nShe had made friends with the spring down in the hollow--that wonderful\ndeep, clear icy-cold spring; it was set about with smooth red sandstones\nand rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern; and beyond it was\na log bridge over the brook.\nThat bridge led Anne's dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond, where\nperpetual twilight reigned under the straight, thick-growing firs and\nspruces; the only flowers there were myriads of delicate \"June bells,\"\nthose shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms, and a few pale, aerial\nstarflowers, like the spirits of last year's blossoms. Gossamers\nglimmered like threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and\ntassels seemed to utter friendly speech.\nAll these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half\nhours which she was allowed for play, and Anne talked Matthew and\nMarilla half-deaf over her discoveries. Not that Matthew complained, to\nbe sure; he listened to it all with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his\nface; Marilla permitted the \"chatter\" until she found herself becoming\ntoo interested in it, whereupon she always promptly quenched Anne by a\ncurt command to hold her tongue.\nAnne was out in the orchard when Mrs. Rachel came, wandering at her\nown sweet will through the lush, tremulous grasses splashed with ruddy\nevening sunshine; so that good lady had an excellent chance to talk\nher illness fully over, describing every ache and pulse beat with\nsuch evident enjoyment that Marilla thought even grippe must bring its\ncompensations. When details were exhausted Mrs. Rachel introduced the\nreal reason of her call.\n\"I've been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew.\"\n\"I don't suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself,\" said\nMarilla. \"I'm getting over my surprise now.\"\n\"It was too bad there was such a mistake,\" said Mrs. Rachel\nsympathetically. \"Couldn't you have sent her back?\"\n\"I suppose we could, but we decided not to. Matthew took a fancy to her.\nAnd I must say I like her myself--although I admit she has her faults.\nThe house seems a different place already. She's a real bright little\nthing.\"\nMarilla said more than she had intended to say when she began, for she\nread disapproval in Mrs. Rachel's expression.\n\"It's a great responsibility you've taken on yourself,\" said that\nlady gloomily, \"especially when you've never had any experience with\nchildren. You don't know much about her or her real disposition, I\nsuppose, and there's no guessing how a child like that will turn out.\nBut I don't want to discourage you I'm sure, Marilla.\"\n\"I'm not feeling discouraged,\" was Marilla's dry response, \"when I make\nup my mind to do a thing it stays made up. I suppose you'd like to see\nAnne. I'll call her in.\"\nAnne came running in presently, her face sparkling with the delight of\nher orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in\nthe unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside\nthe door. She certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short\ntight wincey dress she had worn from the asylum, below which her thin\nlegs seemed ungracefully long. Her freckles were more numerous and\nobtrusive than ever; the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into\nover-brilliant disorder; it had never looked redder than at that moment.\n\"Well, they didn't pick you for your looks, that's sure and certain,\"\nwas Mrs. Rachel Lynde's emphatic comment. Mrs. Rachel was one of those\ndelightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their\nmind without fear or favor. \"She's terrible skinny and homely, Marilla.\nCome here, child, and let me have a look at you. Lawful heart, did\nany one ever see such freckles? And hair as red as carrots! Come here,\nchild, I say.\"\nAnne \"came there,\" but not exactly as Mrs. Rachel expected. With one\nbound she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before Mrs. Rachel, her\nface scarlet with anger, her lips quivering, and her whole slender form\ntrembling from head to foot.\n\"I hate you,\" she cried in a choked voice, stamping her foot on the\nfloor. \"I hate you--I hate you--I hate you--\" a louder stamp with each\nassertion of hatred. \"How dare you call me skinny and ugly? How dare\nyou say I'm freckled and redheaded? You are a rude, impolite, unfeeling\nwoman!\"\n\"Anne!\" exclaimed Marilla in consternation.\nBut Anne continued to face Mrs. Rachel undauntedly, head up, eyes\nblazing, hands clenched, passionate indignation exhaling from her like\nan atmosphere.\n\"How dare you say such things about me?\" she repeated vehemently. \"How\nwould you like to have such things said about you? How would you like\nto be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn't a spark of\nimagination in you? I don't care if I do hurt your feelings by saying\nso! I hope I hurt them. You have hurt mine worse than they were ever\nhurt before even by Mrs. Thomas' intoxicated husband. And I'll _never_\nforgive you for it, never, never!\"\nStamp! Stamp!\n\"Did anybody ever see such a temper!\" exclaimed the horrified Mrs.\nRachel.\n\"Anne go to your room and stay there until I come up,\" said Marilla,\nrecovering her powers of speech with difficulty.\nAnne, bursting into tears, rushed to the hall door, slammed it until the\ntins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the\nhall and up the stairs like a whirlwind. A subdued slam above told that\nthe door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.\n\"Well, I don't envy you your job bringing _that_ up, Marilla,\" said Mrs.\nRachel with unspeakable solemnity.\nMarilla opened her lips to say she knew not what of apology or\ndeprecation. What she did say was a surprise to herself then and ever\nafterwards.\n\"You shouldn't have twitted her about her looks, Rachel.\"\n\"Marilla Cuthbert, you don't mean to say that you are upholding her in\nsuch a terrible display of temper as we've just seen?\" demanded Mrs.\nRachel indignantly.\n\"No,\" said Marilla slowly, \"I'm not trying to excuse her. She's been\nvery naughty and I'll have to give her a talking to about it. But we\nmust make allowances for her. She's never been taught what is right. And\nyou _were_ too hard on her, Rachel.\"\nMarilla could not help tacking on that last sentence, although she was\nagain surprised at herself for doing it. Mrs. Rachel got up with an air\nof offended dignity.\n\"Well, I see that I'll have to be very careful what I say after this,\nMarilla, since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness\nknows where, have to be considered before anything else. Oh, no, I'm not\nvexed--don't worry yourself. I'm too sorry for you to leave any room for\nanger in my mind. You'll have your own troubles with that child. But\nif you'll take my advice--which I suppose you won't do, although I've\nbrought up ten children and buried two--you'll do that 'talking to' you\nmention with a fair-sized birch switch. I should think _that_ would be the\nmost effective language for that kind of a child. Her temper matches her\nhair I guess. Well, good evening, Marilla. I hope you'll come down to\nsee me often as usual. But you can't expect me to visit here again in a\nhurry, if I'm liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion. It's\nsomething new in _my_ experience.\"\nWhereat Mrs. Rachel swept out and away--if a fat woman who always\nwaddled _could_ be said to sweep away--and Marilla with a very solemn face\nbetook herself to the east gable.",

      "text": "On the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do.\nShe felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted.\nHow unfortunate that Anne should have displayed such temper before Mrs.\nRachel Lynde, of all people! Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an\nuncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation\nover this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect\nin Anne's disposition. And how was she to punish her? The amiable\nsuggestion of the birch switch--to the efficiency of which all of Mrs.\nRachel's own children could have borne smarting testimony--did not\nappeal to Marilla. She did not believe she could whip a child. No,\nsome other method of punishment must be found to bring Anne to a proper\nrealization of the enormity of her offense.\nMarilla found Anne face downward on her bed, crying bitterly, quite\noblivious of muddy boots on a clean counterpane.\n\"Anne,\" she said not ungently.\nNo answer.\n\"Anne,\" with greater severity, \"get off that bed this minute and listen\nto what I have to say to you.\"\nAnne squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it, her face\nswollen and tear-stained and her eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor.\n\"This is a nice way for you to behave. Anne! Aren't you ashamed of\nyourself?\"\n\"She hadn't any right to call me ugly and redheaded,\" retorted Anne,\nevasive and defiant.\n\"You hadn't any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did\nto her, Anne. I was ashamed of you--thoroughly ashamed of you. I\nwanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have\ndisgraced me. I'm sure I don't know why you should lose your temper like\nthat just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You\nsay it yourself often enough.\"\n\"Oh, but there's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and\nhearing other people say it,\" wailed Anne. \"You may know a thing is\nso, but you can't help hoping other people don't quite think it is. I\nsuppose you think I have an awful temper, but I couldn't help it. When\nshe said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me.\nI _had_ to fly out at her.\"\n\"Well, you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say. Mrs. Lynde\nwill have a nice story to tell about you everywhere--and she'll tell\nit, too. It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that,\nAnne.\"\n\"Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that\nyou were skinny and ugly,\" pleaded Anne tearfully.\nAn old remembrance suddenly rose up before Marilla. She had been a very\nsmall child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, \"What a\npity she is such a dark, homely little thing.\" Marilla was every day of\nfifty before the sting had gone out of that memory.\n\"I don't say that I think Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying what\nshe did to you, Anne,\" she admitted in a softer tone. \"Rachel is too\noutspoken. But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part. She\nwas a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor--all three very good\nreasons why you should have been respectful to her. You were rude and\nsaucy and\"--Marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment--\"you must go\nto her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her\nto forgive you.\"\n\"I can never do that,\" said Anne determinedly and darkly. \"You can\npunish me in any way you like, Marilla. You can shut me up in a dark,\ndamp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and\nwater and I shall not complain. But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive\nme.\"\n\"We're not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons,\"\nsaid Marilla drily, \"especially as they're rather scarce in Avonlea. But\napologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and you'll stay here in your\nroom until you can tell me you're willing to do it.\"\n\"I shall have to stay here forever then,\" said Anne mournfully, \"because\nI can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her. How can\nI? I'm _not_ sorry. I'm sorry I've vexed you; but I'm _glad_ I told her just\nwhat I did. It was a great satisfaction. I can't say I'm sorry when I'm\nnot, can I? I can't even _imagine_ I'm sorry.\"\n\"Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the\nmorning,\" said Marilla, rising to depart. \"You'll have the night to\nthink over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind. You said\nyou would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables, but\nI must say it hasn't seemed very much like it this evening.\"\nLeaving this Parthian shaft to rankle in Anne's stormy bosom, Marilla\ndescended to the kitchen, grievously troubled in mind and vexed in\nsoul. She was as angry with herself as with Anne, because, whenever she\nrecalled Mrs. Rachel's dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with\namusement and she felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh.",

Had Anne eaten\nanything at all?\nWhen Marilla went out that evening to bring the cows from the back\npasture, Matthew, who had been hanging about the barns and watching,\nslipped into the house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs. As\na general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little\nbedroom off the hall where he slept; once in a while he ventured\nuncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to\ntea. But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he\nhelped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.\nHe tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the\ndoor of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his\nfingers and then open the door to peep in.\nAnne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out\ninto the garden. Very small and unhappy she looked, and Matthew's heart\nsmote him. He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her.\n\"Anne,\" he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, \"how are you\nmaking it, Anne?\"\nAnne smiled wanly.\n\"Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of\ncourse, it's rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that.\"\nAnne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary\nimprisonment before her.\nMatthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without\nloss of time, lest Marilla return prematurely. \"Well now, Anne, don't\nyou think you'd better do it and have it over with?\" he whispered.\n\"It'll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla's a\ndreadful deter-mined woman--dreadful determined, Anne. Do it right off,\nI say, and have it over.\"\n\"Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?\"\n\"Yes--apologize--that's the very word,\" said Matthew eagerly. \"Just\nsmooth it over so to speak. That's what I was trying to get at.\"\n\"I suppose I could do it to oblige you,\" said Anne thoughtfully. \"It\nwould be true enough to say I am sorry, because I _am_ sorry now. I wasn't\na bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all\nnight. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just\nfurious every time. But this morning it was over. I wasn't in a temper\nanymore--and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed\nof myself. But I just couldn't think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde\nso. It would be so humiliating. I made up my mind I'd stay shut up here\nforever rather than do that. But still--I'd do anything for you--if you\nreally want me to--\"\n\"Well now, of course I do. It's terrible lonesome downstairs without\nyou. Just go and smooth things over--that's a good girl.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Anne resignedly. \"I'll tell Marilla as soon as she\ncomes in I've repented.\"\n\"That's right--that's right, Anne. But don't tell Marilla I said\nanything about it. She might think I was putting my oar in and I\npromised not to do that.\"\n\"Wild horses won't drag the secret from me,\" promised Anne solemnly.\n\"How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?\"\nBut Matthew was gone, scared at his own success.

Then the\nradiance vanished. Mournful penitence appeared on every feature. Before\na word was spoken Anne suddenly went down on her knees before the\nastonished Mrs. Rachel and held out her hands beseechingly.\n\"Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry,\" she said with a quiver in\nher voice. \"I could never express all my sorrow, no, not if I used up\na whole dictionary. You must just imagine it. I behaved terribly to\nyou--and I've disgraced the dear friends, Matthew and Marilla, who have\nlet me stay at Green Gables although I'm not a boy. I'm a dreadfully\nwicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out\nby respectable people forever. It was very wicked of me to fly into a\ntemper because you told me the truth. It _was_ the truth; every word you\nsaid was true. My hair is red and I'm freckled and skinny and ugly.\nWhat I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn't have said it. Oh, Mrs.\nLynde, please, please, forgive me. If you refuse it will be a lifelong\nsorrow on a poor little orphan girl, would you, even if she had a\ndreadful temper? Oh, I am sure you wouldn't. Please say you forgive me,\nMrs. Lynde.\"",

      "text": "Anne clasped her hands together, bowed her head, and waited for the word\nof judgment.\nThere was no mistaking her sincerity--it breathed in every tone of her\nvoice. Both Marilla and Mrs. Lynde recognized its unmistakable ring.\nBut the former under-stood in dismay that Anne was actually enjoying\nher valley of humiliation--was reveling in the thoroughness of her\nabasement. Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla,\nhad plumed herself? Anne had turned it into a species of positive\npleasure.\nGood Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see\nthis. She only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and\nall resentment vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart.\n\"There, there, get up, child,\" she said heartily. \"Of course I forgive\nyou. I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway. But I'm such an\noutspoken person. You just mustn't mind me, that's what. It can't be\ndenied your hair is terrible red; but I knew a girl once--went to school\nwith her, in fact--whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she\nwas young, but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn. I\nwouldn't be a mite surprised if yours did, too--not a mite.\"\n\"Oh, Mrs. Lynde!\" Anne drew a long breath as she rose to her feet. \"You\nhave given me a hope. I shall always feel that you are a benefactor. Oh,\nI could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome\nauburn when I grew up. It would be so much easier to be good if one's\nhair was a handsome auburn, don't you think? And now may I go out into\nyour garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and\nMarilla are talking? There is so much more scope for imagination out\nthere.\"\n\"Laws, yes, run along, child. And you can pick a bouquet of them white\nJune lilies over in the corner if you like.\"\nAs the door closed behind Anne Mrs. Lynde got briskly up to light a\nlamp.\n\"She's a real odd little thing. Take this chair, Marilla; it's easier\nthan the one you've got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit\non. Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of\ntaking about her after all. I don't feel so surprised at you and Matthew\nkeeping her as I did--nor so sorry for you, either. She may turn out all\nright. Of course, she has a queer way of expressing herself--a little\ntoo--well, too kind of forcible, you know; but she'll likely get over\nthat now that she's come to live among civilized folks. And then, her\ntemper's pretty quick, I guess; but there's one comfort, a child that\nhas a quick temper, just blaze up and cool down, ain't never likely to\nbe sly or deceitful. Preserve me from a sly child, that's what. On the\nwhole, Marilla, I kind of like her.\"",

      "text": "When Marilla went home Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the\norchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands.\n\"I apologized pretty well, didn't I?\" she said proudly as they went\ndown the lane. \"I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it\nthoroughly.\"\n\"You did it thoroughly, all right enough,\" was Marilla's comment.\nMarilla was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the\nrecollection. She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold\nAnne for apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous! She\ncompromised with her conscience by saying severely:\n\"I hope you won't have occasion to make many more such apologies. I hope\nyou'll try to control your temper now, Anne.\"\n\"That wouldn't be so hard if people wouldn't twit me about my looks,\"\nsaid Anne with a sigh. \"I don't get cross about other things; but I'm\n_so_ tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right\nover. Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I\ngrow up?\"\n\"You shouldn't think so much about your looks, Anne. I'm afraid you are\na very vain little girl.\"\n\"How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?\" protested Anne. \"I love\npretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that\nisn't pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful--just as I feel when I look\nat any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn't beautiful.\"\n\"Handsome is as handsome does,\" quoted Marilla. \"I've had that said\nto me before, but I have my doubts about it,\" remarked skeptical Anne,\nsniffing at her narcissi. \"Oh, aren't these flowers sweet! It was lovely\nof Mrs. Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings against Mrs.\nLynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and\nbe forgiven, doesn't it? Aren't the stars bright tonight? If you could\nlive in a star, which one would you pick? I'd like that lovely clear big\none away over there above that dark hill.\"\n\"Anne, do hold your tongue,\" said Marilla, thoroughly worn out trying to\nfollow the gyrations of Anne's thoughts.\nAnne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy\nwind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young\ndew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out\nthrough the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came\nclose to Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman's hard palm.\n\"It's lovely to be going home and know it's home,\" she said. \"I love\nGreen Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever\nseemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I'm so happy. I could pray right now and\nnot find it a bit hard.\"\nSomething warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla's heart at touch of\nthat thin little hand in her own--a throb of the maternity she had\nmissed, perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed\nher. She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by\ninculcating a moral.\n\"If you'll be a good girl you'll always be happy, Anne. And you should\nnever find it hard to say your prayers.\"\n\"Saying one's prayers isn't exactly the same thing as praying,\" said\nAnne meditatively. \"But I'm going to imagine that I'm the wind that is\nblowing up there in those tree tops. When I get tired of the trees I'll\nimagine I'm gently waving down here in the ferns--and then I'll fly over\nto Mrs. Lynde's garden and set the flowers dancing--and then I'll go\nwith one great swoop over the clover field--and then I'll blow over the\nLake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves.\nOh, there's so much scope for imagination in a wind! So I'll not talk\nany more just now, Marilla.\"\n\"Thanks be to goodness for that,\" breathed Marilla in devout relief.",

One was of snuffy colored gingham which\nMarilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer\nbecause it looked so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered\nsateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and\none was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that\nweek at a Carmody store.\nShe had made them up herself, and they were all made alike--plain skirts\nfulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt\nand tight as sleeves could be.\n\"I'll imagine that I like them,\" said Anne soberly.\n\"I don't want you to imagine it,\" said Marilla, offended. \"Oh, I can see\nyou don't like the dresses! What is the matter with them? Aren't they\nneat and clean and new?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then why don't you like them?\"\n\"They're--they're not--pretty,\" said Anne reluctantly.\n\"Pretty!\" Marilla sniffed. \"I didn't trouble my head about getting\npretty dresses for you. I don't believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I'll\ntell you that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable\ndresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they're all\nyou'll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do\nyou for school when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and Sunday\nschool. I'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear\nthem.

It would give me such a thrill,\nMarilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.\"\n\"Well, you'll have to do without your thrill. I hadn't any material\nto waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things\nanyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones.\"\n\"But I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and\nsensible all by myself,\" persisted Anne mournfully.\n\"Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your\ncloset, and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson.

      "text": "Anne clasped her hands and looked at the dresses.\n\"I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves,\" she\nwhispered disconsolately. \"I prayed for one, but I didn't much expect it\non that account. I didn't suppose God would have time to bother about\na little orphan girl's dress. I knew I'd just have to depend on\nMarilla for it. Well, fortunately I can imagine that one of them is of\nsnow-white muslin with lovely lace frills and three-puffed sleeves.\"\nThe next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented Marilla from\ngoing to Sunday-school with Anne.\n\"You'll have to go down and call for Mrs. Lynde, Anne,\" she said.\n\"She'll see that you get into the right class. Now, mind you behave\nyourself properly. Stay to preaching afterwards and ask Mrs. Lynde to\nshow you our pew. Here's a cent for collection. Don't stare at people\nand don't fidget. I shall expect you to tell me the text when you come\nhome.\"\nAnne started off irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff black-and-white\nsateen, which, while decent as regards length and certainly not open to\nthe charge of skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle\nof her thin figure. Her hat was a little, flat, glossy, new sailor, the\nextreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed Anne, who\nhad permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flowers. The latter,\nhowever, were supplied before Anne reached the main road, for being\nconfronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind-stirred\nbuttercups and a glory of wild roses, Anne promptly and liberally\ngarlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them. Whatever other people\nmight have thought of the result it satisfied Anne, and she tripped\ngaily down the road, holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink\nand yellow very proudly.\nWhen she had reached Mrs. Lynde's house she found that lady gone.\nNothing daunted, Anne proceeded onward to the church alone. In the porch\nshe found a crowd of little girls, all more or less gaily attired in\nwhites and blues and pinks, and all staring with curious eyes at this\nstranger in their midst, with her extraordinary head adornment. Avonlea\nlittle girls had already heard queer stories about Anne. Mrs. Lynde said\nshe had an awful temper; Jerry Buote, the hired boy at Green Gables,\nsaid she talked all the time to herself or to the trees and flowers\nlike a crazy girl. They looked at her and whispered to each other behind\ntheir quarterlies. Nobody made any friendly advances, then or later\non when the opening exercises were over and Anne found herself in Miss\nRogerson's class.\nMiss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school\nclass for twenty years. Her method of teaching was to ask the printed\nquestions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the\nparticular little girl she thought ought to answer the question. She\nlooked very often at Anne, and Anne, thanks to Marilla's drilling,\nanswered promptly; but it may be questioned if she understood very much\nabout either question or answer.\nShe did not think she liked Miss Rogerson, and she felt very miserable;\nevery other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that\nlife was really not worth living without puffed sleeves.\n\"Well, how did you like Sunday school?\" Marilla wanted to know when Anne\ncame home. Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane,\nso Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.\n\"I didn't like it a bit. It was horrid.\"\n\"Anne Shirley!\" said Marilla rebukingly.\nAnne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny's\nleaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.\n\"They might have been lonesome while I was away,\" she explained. \"And\nnow about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs.\nLynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with\na lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the\nwindow while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully\nlong prayer. I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through\nif I hadn't been sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the\nLake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts\nof splendid things.\"\n\"You shouldn't have done anything of the sort. You should have listened\nto Mr. Bell.\"\n\"But he wasn't talking to me,\" protested Anne. \"He was talking to God\nand he didn't seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. I think\nhe thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of white\nbirches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through\nthem, 'way, 'way down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a\nbeautiful dream! It gave me a thrill and I just said, 'Thank you for it,\nGod,' two or three times.\"\n\"Not out loud, I hope,\" said Marilla anxiously.\n\"Oh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last\nand they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson's class.\nThere were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried\nto imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn't. Why couldn't I? It was\nas easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in\nthe east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had\nreally truly puffs.\"\n\"You shouldn't have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school.\nYou should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it.\"\n\"Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so\nmany. I don't think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were\nlots I wanted to ask her, but I didn't like to because I didn't think\nshe was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a\nparaphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn't, but I could\nrecite, 'The Dog at His Master's Grave' if she liked. That's in the\nThird Royal Reader. It isn't a really truly religious piece of poetry,\nbut it's so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it\nwouldn't do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next\nSunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it's splendid. There are\ntwo lines in particular that just thrill me.\n\"'Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell\nIn Midian's evil day.'\n\"I don't know what 'squadrons' means nor 'Midian,' either, but it sounds\n_so_ tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it.\nI'll practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss\nRogerson--because Mrs. Lynde was too far away--to show me your pew.\nI sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third\nchapter, second and third verses.

I'm an inch taller\nthan Diana, but she is ever so much fatter; she says she'd like to be\nthin because it's so much more graceful, but I'm afraid she only said\nit to soothe my feelings. We're going to the shore some day to gather\nshells. We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the\nDryad's Bubble. Isn't that a perfectly elegant name? I read a story\nonce about a spring called that. A dryad is sort of a grown-up fairy, I\nthink.\"\n\"Well, all I hope is you won't talk Diana to death,\" said Marilla. \"But\nremember this in all your planning, Anne. You're not going to play all\nthe time nor most of it. You'll have your work to do and it'll have to\nbe done first.\"\nAnne's cup of happiness was full, and Matthew caused it to overflow. He\nhad just got home from a trip to the store at Carmody, and he sheepishly\nproduced a small parcel from his pocket and handed it to Anne, with a\ndeprecatory look at Marilla.\n\"I heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties, so I got you some,\" he\nsaid.\n\"Humph,\" sniffed Marilla. \"It'll ruin her teeth and stomach. There,\nthere, child, don't look so dismal. You can eat those, since Matthew\nhas gone and got them. He'd better have brought you peppermints. They're\nwholesomer. Don't sicken yourself eating all them at once now.\"\n\"Oh, no, indeed, I won't,\" said Anne eagerly. \"I'll just eat one\ntonight, Marilla. And I can give Diana half of them, can't I? The\nother half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her. It's\ndelightful to think I have something to give her.\"\n\"I will say it for the child,\" said Marilla when Anne had gone to\nher gable, \"she isn't stingy. I'm glad, for of all faults I detest\nstinginess in a child. Dear me, it's only three weeks since she came,\nand it seems as if she'd been here always. I can't imagine the place\nwithout her. Now, don't be looking I told-you-so, Matthew. That's bad\nenough in a woman, but it isn't to be endured in a man. I'm perfectly\nwilling to own up that I'm glad I consented to keep the child and that\nI'm getting fond of her, but don't you rub it in, Matthew Cuthbert.\"",

I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came\nhome from church yesterday evening, but I can't find it anywhere.\"\n\"I--I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society,\" said\nAnne, a little slowly. \"I was passing your door when I saw it on the\ncushion, so I went in to look at it.\"\n\"Did you touch it?\" said Marilla sternly.\n\"Y-e-e-s,\" admitted Anne, \"I took it up and I pinned it on my breast\njust to see how it would look.\"\n\"You had no business to do anything of the sort. It's very wrong in a\nlittle girl to meddle. You shouldn't have gone into my room in the first\nplace and you shouldn't have touched a brooch that didn't belong to you\nin the second. Where did you put it?\"\n\"Oh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn't it on a minute. Truly, I\ndidn't mean to meddle, Marilla. I didn't think about its being wrong to\ngo in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I'll never\ndo it again. That's one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty\nthing twice.\"\n\"You didn't put it back,\" said Marilla. \"That brooch isn't anywhere on\nthe bureau. You've taken it out or something, Anne.\"\n\"I did put it back,\" said Anne quickly--pertly, Marilla thought. \"I\ndon't just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in\nthe china tray. But I'm perfectly certain I put it back.\"\n\"I'll go and have another look,\" said Marilla, determining to be just.\n\"If you put that brooch back it's there still. If it isn't I'll know you\ndidn't, that's all!\"\nMarilla went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the\nbureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly\nbe. It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen.\n\"Anne, the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last\nperson to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth\nat once. Did you take it out and lose it?\"\n\"No, I didn't,\" said Anne solemnly, meeting Marilla's angry gaze\nsquarely. \"I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the\ntruth, if I was to be led to the block for it--although I'm not very\ncertain what a block is. So there, Marilla.\"\nAnne's \"so there\" was only intended to emphasize her assertion, but\nMarilla took it as a display of defiance.\n\"I believe you are telling me a falsehood, Anne,\" she said sharply. \"I\nknow you are. There now, don't say anything more unless you are prepared\nto tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are\nready to confess.\"\n\"Will I take the peas with me?\" said Anne meekly.\n\"No, I'll finish shelling them myself. Do as I bid you.\"\nWhen Anne had gone Marilla went about her evening tasks in a very\ndisturbed state of mind. She was worried about her valuable brooch. What\nif Anne had lost it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken\nit, when anybody could see she must have! With such an innocent face,\ntoo!\n\"I don't know what I wouldn't sooner have had happen,\" thought Marilla,\nas she nervously shelled the peas. \"Of course, I don't suppose she meant\nto steal it or anything like that. She's just taken it to play with\nor help along that imagination of hers. She must have taken it, that's\nclear, for there hasn't been a soul in that room since she was in it, by\nher own story, until I went up tonight. And the brooch is gone, there's\nnothing surer. I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for\nfear she'll be punished. It's a dreadful thing to think she tells\nfalsehoods. It's a far worse thing than her fit of temper. It's a\nfearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can't trust.\nSlyness and untruthfulness--that's what she has displayed. I declare I\nfeel worse about that than about the brooch. If she'd only have told the\ntruth about it I wouldn't mind so much.\"",

      "text": "imagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and\ngeography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips said my\nspelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could\nsee it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have\nbeen politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and\nSophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with 'May I see you home?' on\nit. I'm to give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear\nher bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads\noff the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh,\nMarilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she\nheard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose.\nMarilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you\ncan't imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. Marilla, have I really\na pretty nose? I know you'll tell me the truth.\"\n\"Your nose is well enough,\" said Marilla shortly. Secretly she thought\nAnne's nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of\ntelling her so.\nThat was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. And now, this\ncrisp September morning, Anne and Diana were tripping blithely down the\nBirch Path, two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea.\n\"I guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today,\" said Diana. \"He's been\nvisiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he only came\nhome Saturday night. He's _aw'fly_ handsome, Anne. And he teases the\ngirls something terrible. He just torments our lives out.\"\nDiana's voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented\nout than not.\n\"Gilbert Blythe?\" said Anne. \"Isn't his name that's written up on the\nporch wall with Julia Bell's and a big 'Take Notice' over them?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Diana, tossing her head, \"but I'm sure he doesn't like Julia\nBell so very much. I've heard him say he studied the multiplication\ntable by her freckles.\"\n\"Oh, don't speak about freckles to me,\" implored Anne. \"It isn't\ndelicate when I've got so many. But I do think that writing take-notices\nup on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever. I should\njust like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy's. Not, of\ncourse,\" she hastened to add, \"that anybody would.\"\nAnne sighed. She didn't want her name written up. But it was a little\nhumiliating to know that there was no danger of it.\n\"Nonsense,\" said Diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played\nsuch havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured\non the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices. \"It's only meant as\na joke. And don't you be too sure your name won't ever be written up.\nCharlie Sloane is _dead gone_ on you. He told his mother--his _mother_,\nmind you--that you were the smartest girl in school. That's better than\nbeing good looking.\"\n\"No, it isn't,\" said Anne, feminine to the core. \"I'd rather be pretty\nthan clever. And I hate Charlie Sloane, I can't bear a boy with goggle\neyes. If anyone wrote my name up with his I'd never _get_ over it, Diana\nBarry. But it _is_ nice to keep head of your class.\"",

      "text": "\"You'll have Gilbert in your class after this,\" said Diana, \"and he's\nused to being head of his class, I can tell you. He's only in the fourth\nbook although he's nearly fourteen. Four years ago his father was sick\nand had to go out to Alberta for his health and Gilbert went with him.\nThey were there three years and Gil didn't go to school hardly any\nuntil they came back. You won't find it so easy to keep head after this,\nAnne.\"\n\"I'm glad,\" said Anne quickly. \"I couldn't really feel proud of keeping\nhead of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. I got up yesterday\nspelling 'ebullition.' Josie Pye was head and, mind you, she peeped\nin her book. Mr. Phillips didn't see her--he was looking at Prissy\nAndrews--but I did. I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she\ngot as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.\"\n\"Those Pye girls are cheats all round,\" said Diana indignantly, as they\nclimbed the fence of the main road. \"Gertie Pye actually went and put\nher milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. Did you ever? I\ndon't speak to her now.\"\nWhen Mr. Phillips was in the back of the room hearing Prissy Andrews's\nLatin, Diana whispered to Anne, \"That's Gilbert Blythe sitting right\nacross the aisle from you, Anne. Just look at him and see if you don't\nthink he's handsome.\"\nAnne looked accordingly. She had a good chance to do so, for the said\nGilbert Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid\nof Ruby Gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. He\nwas a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth\ntwisted into a teasing smile. Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take\na sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek,\nbelieving that her hair was pulled out by the roots. Everybody looked at\nher and Mr. Phillips glared so sternly that Ruby began to cry. Gilbert\nhad whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the\nsoberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at\nAnne and winked with inexpressible drollery.\n\"I think your Gilbert Blythe _is_ handsome,\" confided Anne to Diana,\n\"but I think he's very bold. It isn't good manners to wink at a strange\ngirl.\"\nBut it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.\nMr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to\nPrissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as\nthey pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their\nslates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.\nGilbert Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him and failing\nutterly, because Anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only\nto the very existence of Gilbert Blythe, but of every other scholar in\nAvonlea school itself. With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes\nfixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west\nwindow afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and\nseeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.\nGilbert Blythe wasn't used to putting himself out to make a girl look\nat him and meeting with failure. She _should_ look at him, that red-haired\nShirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren't\nlike the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.\nGilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne's long red\nbraid, held it out at arm's length and said in a piercing whisper:\n\"Carrots! Carrots!\"\nThen Anne looked at him with a vengeance!\nShe did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies\nfallen into cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert\nfrom eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry\ntears.\n\"You mean, hateful boy!\" she exclaimed passionately. \"How dare you!\"\nAnd then--thwack! Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert's head and\ncracked it--slate not head--clear across.\nAvonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable\none. Everybody said \"Oh\" in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby\nGillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Tommy\nSloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared\nopen-mouthed at the tableau.\nMr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Anne's\nshoulder.\n\"Anne Shirley, what does this mean?\" he said angrily. Anne returned no\nanswer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell\nbefore the whole school that she had been called \"carrots.\" Gilbert it\nwas who spoke up stoutly.\n\"It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her.\"\nMr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.\n\"I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such\na vindictive spirit,\" he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of\nbeing a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts\nof small imperfect mortals. \"Anne, go and stand on the platform in front\nof the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.\"\nAnne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under\nwhich her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white,\nset face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the\nblackboard above her head.\n\"Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control\nher temper,\" and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,\nwho couldn't read writing, should understand it.\nAnne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.\nShe did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart\nfor that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With\nresentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana's\nsympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane's indignant nods and Josie Pye's\nmalicious smiles. As for Gilbert Blythe, she would not even look at him.\nShe would _never_ look at him again! She would never speak to him!!",

      "text": "excruciation if nothing else had happened. But when things begin to\nhappen they are apt to keep on.\nAvonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Bell's spruce\ngrove over the hill and across his big pasture field. From there they\ncould keep an eye on Eben Wright's house, where the master boarded. When\nthey saw Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse;\nbut the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright's lane\nthey were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three\nminutes too late.\nOn the following day Mr. Phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic\nfits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should\nexpect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned. Anyone\nwho came in late would be punished.\nAll the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Bell's spruce grove as\nusual, fully intending to stay only long enough to \"pick a chew.\" But\nspruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they\npicked and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that\nrecalled them to a sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting\nfrom the top of a patriarchal old spruce \"Master's coming.\"\nThe girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the\nschoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. The boys, who had to\nwriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not\nbeen picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the\ngrove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a\nwreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity\nof the shadowy places, was latest of all. Anne could run like a deer,\nhowever; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys\nat the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as Mr.\nPhillips was in the act of hanging up his hat.\nMr. Phillips's brief reforming energy was over; he didn't want the\nbother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something\nto save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it\nin Anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a\nforgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a\nparticularly rakish and disheveled appearance.\n\"Anne Shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boys' company we\nshall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,\" he said sarcastically.\n\"Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe.\"\nThe other boys snickered. Diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the\nwreath from Anne's hair and squeezed her hand. Anne stared at the master\nas if turned to stone.\n\"Did you hear what I said, Anne?\" queried Mr. Phillips sternly.\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Anne slowly \"but I didn't suppose you really meant it.\"\n\"I assure you I did\"--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the\nchildren, and Anne especially, hated. It flicked on the raw. \"Obey me at\nonce.\"\nFor a moment Anne looked as if she meant to disobey. Then, realizing\nthat there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the\naisle, sat down beside Gilbert Blythe, and buried her face in her arms\non the desk. Ruby Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down,\ntold the others going home from school that she'd \"acksually never seen\nanything like it--it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.\"\nTo Anne, this was as the end of all things. It was bad enough to be\nsingled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it\nwas worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should\nbe Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly\nunbearable. Anne felt that she could not bear it and it would be of\nno use to try. Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and\nhumiliation.\nAt first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged.\nBut as Anne never lifted her head and as Gilbert worked fractions as if\nhis whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned\nto their own tasks and Anne was forgotten. When Mr. Phillips called the\nhistory class out Anne should have gone, but Anne did not move, and\nMr. Phillips, who had been writing some verses \"To Priscilla\" before he\ncalled the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never\nmissed her. Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk\na little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, \"You are sweet,\" and\nslipped it under the curve of Anne's arm. Whereupon Anne arose, took the\npink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the\nfloor, ground it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position\nwithout deigning to bestow a glance on Gilbert.\nWhen school went out Anne marched to her desk, ostentatiously took out\neverything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and\narithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate.\n\"What are you taking all those things home for, Anne?\" Diana wanted to\nknow, as soon as they were out on the road. She had not dared to ask the\nquestion before.\n\"I am not coming back to school any more,\" said Anne. Diana gasped and\nstared at Anne to see if she meant it.\n\"Will Marilla let you stay home?\" she asked.\n\"She'll have to,\" said Anne. \"I'll _never_ go to school to that man\nagain.\"\n\"Oh, Anne!\" Diana looked as if she were ready to cry. \"I do think you're\nmean. What shall I do? Mr. Phillips will make me sit with that horrid\nGertie Pye--I know he will because she is sitting alone. Do come back,\nAnne.\"\n\"I'd do almost anything in the world for you, Diana,\" said Anne sadly.\n\"I'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But\nI can't do this, so please don't ask it. You harrow up my very soul.\"\n\"Just think of all the fun you will miss,\" mourned Diana. \"We are going\nto build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and we'll be playing\nball next week and you've never played ball, Anne. It's tremendously\nexciting. And we're going to learn a new song--Jane Andrews is\npracticing it up now; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new Pansy\nbook next week and we're all going to read it out loud, chapter about,\ndown by the brook. And you know you are so fond of reading out loud,\nAnne.\"\nNothing moved Anne in the least. Her mind was made up. She would not go\nto school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so when she got home.\n\"Nonsense,\" said Marilla.\n\"It isn't nonsense at all,\" said Anne, gazing at Marilla with solemn,\nreproachful eyes. \"Don't you understand, Marilla? I've been insulted.\"\n\"Insulted fiddlesticks! You'll go to school tomorrow as usual.\"\n\"Oh, no.\" Anne shook her head gently. \"I'm not going back, Marilla. I'll\nlearn my lessons at home and I'll be as good as I can be and hold my\ntongue all the time if it's possible at all. But I will not go back to\nschool, I assure you.\"\nMarilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking\nout of Anne's small face. She understood that she would have trouble in\novercoming it; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then.\n\"I'll run down and see Rachel about it this evening,\" she thought.\n\"There's no use reasoning with Anne now. She's too worked up and I've\nan idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion. Far as I can\nmake out from her story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a\nrather high hand. But it would never do to say so to her. I'll just talk\nit over with Rachel. She's sent ten children to school and she ought to\nknow something about it. She'll have heard the whole story, too, by this\ntime.\"\nMarilla found Mrs. Lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully\nas usual.\n\"I suppose you know what I've come about,\" she said, a little\nshamefacedly.\nMrs. Rachel nodded.\n\"About Anne's fuss in school, I reckon,\" she said. \"Tillie Boulter was\nin on her way home from school and told me about it.\"\n\"I don't know what to do with her,\" said Marilla. \"She declares she\nwon't go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I've been\nexpecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were\ngoing too smooth to last. She's so high strung. What would you advise,\nRachel?\"\n\"Well, since you've asked my advice, Marilla,\" said Mrs. Lynde\namiably--Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--\"I'd just\nhumor her a little at first, that's what I'd do. It's my belief that\nMr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn't do to say so to the\nchildren, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday\nfor giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who\nwere late should have been punished as well as Anne, that's what. And I\ndon't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It\nisn't modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne's part\nright through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular\namong them, somehow. I never thought she'd take with them so well.\"\n\"Then you really think I'd better let her stay home,\" said Marilla in\namazement.\n\"Yes. That is I wouldn't say school to her again until she said it\nherself.

The less fuss made the\nbetter, in my opinion. She won't miss much by not going to school, as\nfar as _that_ goes. Mr. Phillips isn't any good at all as a teacher. The\norder he keeps is scandalous, that's what, and he neglects the young\nfry and puts all his time on those big scholars he's getting ready for\nQueen's. He'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle\nhadn't been a trustee--_the_ trustee, for he just leads the other two\naround by the nose, that's what. I declare, I don't know what education\nin this Island is coming to.\"\nMrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the\nhead of the educational system of the Province things would be much\nbetter managed.\nMarilla took Mrs. Rachel's advice and not another word was said to Anne",

When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?\n\"Well, Anne Shirley,\" said Marilla as soon as she could speak, \"if you\nmust borrow trouble, for pity's sake borrow it handier home.

Diana had much to tell Anne of what\nwent on in school. She had to sit with Gertie Pye and she hated\nit; Gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made\nher--Diana's--blood run cold; Ruby Gillis had charmed all her warts\naway, true's you live, with a magic pebble that old Mary Joe from the\nCreek gave her. You had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw\nit away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the\nwarts would all go. Charlie Sloane's name was written up with Em White's\non the porch wall and Em White was _awful mad_ about it; Sam Boulter had\n\"sassed\" Mr. Phillips in class and Mr. Phillips whipped him and Sam's\nfather came down to the school and dared Mr. Phillips to lay a hand on\none of his children again; and Mattie Andrews had a new red hood and a\nblue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were\nperfectly sickening; and Lizzie Wright didn't speak to Mamie Wilson\nbecause Mamie Wilson's grown-up sister had cut out Lizzie Wright's\ngrown-up sister with her beau; and everybody missed Anne so and wished\nshe's come to school again; and Gilbert Blythe--\nBut Anne didn't want to hear about Gilbert Blythe. She jumped up\nhurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial.\nAnne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no\nbottle of raspberry cordial there. Search revealed it away back on the\ntop shelf. Anne put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler.\n\"Now, please help yourself, Diana,\" she said politely. \"I don't believe\nI'll have any just now. I don't feel as if I wanted any after all those\napples.\"\nDiana poured herself out a tumblerful, looked at its bright-red hue\nadmiringly, and then sipped it daintily.\n\"That's awfully nice raspberry cordial, Anne,\" she said. \"I didn't know\nraspberry cordial was so nice.\"\n\"I'm real glad you like it. Take as much as you want. I'm going to\nrun out and stir the fire up. There are so many responsibilities on a\nperson's mind when they're keeping house, isn't there?\"\nWhen Anne came back from the kitchen Diana was drinking her second\nglassful of cordial; and, being entreated thereto by Anne, she offered\nno particular objection to the drinking of a third. The tumblerfuls were\ngenerous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice.\n\"The nicest I ever drank,\" said Diana. \"It's ever so much nicer than\nMrs. Lynde's, although she brags of hers so much. It doesn't taste a bit\nlike hers.\"",

      "text": "\"I should think Marilla's raspberry cordial would prob'ly be much nicer\nthan Mrs. Lynde's,\" said Anne loyally. \"Marilla is a famous cook. She is\ntrying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Diana, it is uphill work.\nThere's so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go\nby rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in. I\nwas thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Diana. I thought you\nwere desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I\nwent boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life; and then I took\nthe smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the\ngraveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with\nyour tears; and you never, never forgot the friend of your youth who\nsacrificed her life for you. Oh, it was such a pathetic tale, Diana.\nThe tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake. But\nI forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour is so\nessential to cakes, you know. Marilla was very cross and I don't wonder.\nI'm a great trial to her. She was terribly mortified about the pudding\nsauce last week. We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there\nwas half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over. Marilla said\nthere was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry\nshelf and cover it. I meant to cover it just as much as could be, Diana,\nbut when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun--of course I'm a\nProtestant but I imagined I was a Catholic--taking the veil to bury a\nbroken heart in cloistered seclusion; and I forgot all about covering\nthe pudding sauce. I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry.\nDiana, fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in\nthat pudding sauce! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out\nin the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters. Marilla was out\nmilking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I'd give the\nsauce to the pigs; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was\na frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow,\nwhichever they wanted to be, so I never thought about the pudding sauce\nagain and Marilla sent me out to pick apples. Well, Mr. and Mrs. Chester\nRoss from Spencervale came here that morning. You know they are very\nstylish people, especially Mrs. Chester Ross. When Marilla called me in\ndinner was all ready and everybody was at the table. I tried to be as\npolite and dignified as I could be, for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to\nthink I was a ladylike little girl even if I wasn't pretty. Everything\nwent right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand\nand the pitcher of pudding sauce _warmed up_, in the other. Diana, that\nwas a terrible moment. I remembered everything and I just stood up in\nmy place and shrieked out 'Marilla, you mustn't use that pudding sauce.\nThere was a mouse drowned in it. I forgot to tell you before.' Oh,\nDiana, I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred.\nMrs. Chester Ross just _looked_ at me and I thought I would sink through\nthe floor with mortification. She is such a perfect housekeeper and\nfancy what she must have thought of us. Marilla turned red as fire but\nshe never said a word--then. She just carried that sauce and pudding out\nand brought in some strawberry preserves. She even offered me some, but\nI couldn't swallow a mouthful. It was like heaping coals of fire on\nmy head. After Mrs. Chester Ross went away, Marilla gave me a dreadful\nscolding. Why, Diana, what is the matter?\"\nDiana had stood up very unsteadily; then she sat down again, putting her\nhands to her head.\n\"I'm--I'm awful sick,\" she said, a little thickly. \"I--I--must go right\nhome.\"\n\"Oh, you mustn't dream of going home without your tea,\" cried Anne in\ndistress. \"I'll get it right off--I'll go and put the tea down this very\nminute.\"\n\"I must go home,\" repeated Diana, stupidly but determinedly.\n\"Let me get you a lunch anyhow,\" implored Anne. \"Let me give you a bit\nof fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves. Lie down on the sofa for\na little while and you'll be better. Where do you feel bad?\"\n\"I must go home,\" said Diana, and that was all she would say. In vain\nAnne pleaded.\n\"I never heard of company going home without tea,\" she mourned. \"Oh,\nDiana, do you suppose that it's possible you're really taking the\nsmallpox? If you are I'll go and nurse you, you can depend on that. I'll\nnever forsake you. But I do wish you'd stay till after tea. Where do you\nfeel bad?\"\n\"I'm awful dizzy,\" said Diana.\nAnd indeed, she walked very dizzily. Anne, with tears of disappointment\nin her eyes, got Diana's hat and went with her as far as the Barry\nyard fence. Then she wept all the way back to Green Gables, where she\nsorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the\npantry and got tea ready for Matthew and Jerry, with all the zest gone\nout of the performance.",

Anne was watching for her coming and flew\nto the porch door to meet her.\n\"Oh, Marilla, I know by your face that it's been no use,\" she said\nsorrowfully. \"Mrs. Barry won't forgive me?\"\n\"Mrs. Barry indeed!\" snapped Marilla. \"Of all the unreasonable women\nI ever saw she's the worst. I told her it was all a mistake and you\nweren't to blame, but she just simply didn't believe me. And she rubbed\nit well in about my currant wine and how I'd always said it couldn't\nhave the least effect on anybody. I just told her plainly that currant\nwine wasn't meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a\nchild I had to do with was so greedy I'd sober her up with a right good\nspanking.\"\nMarilla whisked into the kitchen, grievously disturbed, leaving a very\nmuch distracted little soul in the porch behind her. Presently Anne\nstepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk; very determinedly and\nsteadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the\nlog bridge and up through the spruce grove, lighted by a pale little\nmoon hanging low over the western woods. Mrs. Barry, coming to the door\nin answer to a timid knock, found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on\nthe doorstep.\nHer face hardened. Mrs. Barry was a woman of strong prejudices and\ndislikes, and her anger was of the cold, sullen sort which is always\nhardest to overcome. To do her justice, she really believed Anne had\nmade Diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense, and she was honestly\nanxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of\nfurther intimacy with such a child.\n\"What do you want?\" she said stiffly.\nAnne clasped her hands.\n\"Oh, Mrs. Barry, please forgive me. I did not mean to--to--intoxicate\nDiana. How could I? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl\nthat kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all\nthe world. Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose? I thought\nit was only raspberry cordial. I was firmly convinced it was raspberry\ncordial. Oh, please don't say that you won't let Diana play with me any\nmore. If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe.\"\nThis speech which would have softened good Mrs. Lynde's heart in a\ntwinkling, had no effect on Mrs. Barry except to irritate her still\nmore. She was suspicious of Anne's big words and dramatic gestures and\nimagined that the child was making fun of her. So she said, coldly and\ncruelly:\n\"I don't think you are a fit little girl for Diana to associate with.\nYou'd better go home and behave yourself.\"",

But the hope faded when she saw Diana's dejected\ncountenance.\n\"Your mother hasn't relented?\" she gasped.\nDiana shook her head mournfully.\n\"No; and oh, Anne, she says I'm never to play with you again. I've cried\nand cried and I told her it wasn't your fault, but it wasn't any use. I\nhad ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to\nyou.

Oh, just say it once again.\"\n\"I love you devotedly, Anne,\" said Diana stanchly, \"and I always will,\nyou may be sure of that.\"\n\"And I will always love thee, Diana,\" said Anne, solemnly extending her\nhand. \"In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my\nlonely life, as that last story we read together says.

      "text": "Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely\nat the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green\nGables all to themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned\nWaterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the\nwindowpanes. Matthew nodded over a _Farmers' Advocate_ on the sofa and\nAnne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite\nsundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that\nJane Andrews had lent her that day. Jane had assured her that it was\nwarranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and\nAnne's fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that would mean Gilbert\nBlythe's triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her back on the clock shelf\nand tried to imagine it wasn't there.\n\"Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?\"\n\"Well now, no, I didn't,\" said Matthew, coming out of his doze with a\nstart.\n\"I wish you had,\" sighed Anne, \"because then you'd be able to sympathize\nwith me. You can't sympathize properly if you've never studied it. It is\ncasting a cloud over my whole life. I'm such a dunce at it, Matthew.\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew soothingly. \"I guess you're all right\nat anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair's store at Carmody\nthat you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid\nprogress. 'Rapid progress' was his very words. There's them as runs down\nTeddy Phillips and says he ain't much of a teacher, but I guess he's all\nright.\"\nMatthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was \"all right.\"\n\"I'm sure I'd get on better with geometry if only he wouldn't change\nthe letters,\" complained Anne. \"I learn the proposition off by heart and\nthen he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what\nare in the book and I get all mixed up. I don't think a teacher should\ntake such a mean advantage, do you? We're studying agriculture now and\nI've found out at last what makes the roads red. It's a great comfort.\nI wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde\nsays Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa\nand that it's an awful warning to the electors. She says if women were\nallowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change. What way do you\nvote, Matthew?\"\n\"Conservative,\" said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was part of\nMatthew's religion.\n\"Then I'm Conservative too,\" said Anne decidedly. \"I'm glad because\nGil--because some of the boys in school are Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips\nis a Grit too because Prissy Andrews's father is one, and Ruby Gillis\nsays that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl's\nmother in religion and her father in politics. Is that true, Matthew?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Did you ever go courting, Matthew?\"\n\"Well now, no, I dunno's I ever did,\" said Matthew, who had certainly\nnever thought of such a thing in his whole existence.\nAnne reflected with her chin in her hands.\n\"It must be rather interesting, don't you think, Matthew? Ruby Gillis\nsays when she grows up she's going to have ever so many beaus on the\nstring and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too\nexciting. I'd rather have just one in his right mind. But Ruby Gillis\nknows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big\nsisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot\ncakes. Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening.\nHe says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is\nstudying for Queen's too, and I should think she needed help a lot more\nthan Prissy because she's ever so much stupider, but he never goes to\nhelp her in the evenings at all. There are a great many things in this\nworld that I can't understand very well, Matthew.\"\n\"Well now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,\" acknowledged\nMatthew.\n\"Well, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I won't allow myself to\nopen that new book Jane lent me until I'm through. But it's a terrible\ntemptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there\njust as plain. Jane said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book\nthat makes me cry. But I think I'll carry that book into the sitting\nroom and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must\n_not_ give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if\nI implore you on my bended knees. It's all very well to say resist\ntemptation, but it's ever so much easier to resist it if you can't get\nthe key. And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets,\nMatthew? Wouldn't you like some russets?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno but what I would,\" said Matthew, who never ate\nrussets but knew Anne's weakness for them.\nJust as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of\nrussets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside\nand the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana\nBarry, white faced and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around\nher head. Anne promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise,\nand plate, candle, and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder\nand were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease, the next day,",

      "text": "The night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy\nslope; big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the\ndark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the\nwind whistling through them. Anne thought it was truly delightful to go\nskimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend\nwho had been so long estranged.\nMinnie May, aged three, was really very sick. She lay on the kitchen\nsofa feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard\nall over the house. Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl\nfrom the creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children\nduring her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of\nthinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.\nAnne went to work with skill and promptness.\n\"Minnie May has croup all right; she's pretty bad, but I've seen them\nworse. First we must have lots of hot water. I declare, Diana, there\nisn't more than a cupful in the kettle! There, I've filled it up, and,\nMary Joe, you may put some wood in the stove. I don't want to hurt your\nfeelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if\nyou'd any imagination. Now, I'll undress Minnie May and put her to bed\nand you try to find some soft flannel cloths, Diana. I'm going to give\nher a dose of ipecac first of all.\"\nMinnie May did not take kindly to the ipecac but Anne had not brought up\nthree pairs of twins for nothing. Down that ipecac went, not only once,\nbut many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls\nworked patiently over the suffering Minnie May, and Young Mary Joe,\nhonestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated\nmore water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.\nIt was three o'clock when Matthew came with a doctor, for he had been\nobliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one. But the pressing need\nfor assistance was past. Minnie May was much better and was sleeping\nsoundly.\n\"I was awfully near giving up in despair,\" explained Anne. \"She got\nworse and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were,\neven the last pair. I actually thought she was going to choke to death.\nI gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose\nwent down I said to myself--not to Diana or Young Mary Joe, because I\ndidn't want to worry them any more than they were worried, but I had\nto say it to myself just to relieve my feelings--'This is the last\nlingering hope and I fear, tis a vain one.' But in about three minutes\nshe coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away. You must\njust imagine my relief, doctor, because I can't express it in words. You\nknow there are some things that cannot be expressed in words.\"\n\"Yes, I know,\" nodded the doctor. He looked at Anne as if he were\nthinking some things about her that couldn't be expressed in words.\nLater on, however, he expressed them to Mr. and Mrs. Barry.\n\"That little redheaded girl they have over at Cuthbert's is as smart as\nthey make 'em. I tell you she saved that baby's life, for it would have\nbeen too late by the time I got there. She seems to have a skill and\npresence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age. I never saw\nanything like the eyes of her when she was explaining the case to me.\"",

The world looks like\nsomething God had just imagined for His own pleasure, doesn't it? Those\ntrees look as if I could blow them away with a breath--pouf! I'm so glad\nI live in a world where there are white frosts, aren't you? And I'm so\nglad Mrs. Hammond had three pairs of twins after all. If she hadn't I\nmightn't have known what to do for Minnie May. I'm real sorry I was\never cross with Mrs. Hammond for having twins. But, oh, Matthew, I'm so\nsleepy. I can't go to school. I just know I couldn't keep my eyes open\nand I'd be so stupid. But I hate to stay home, for Gil--some of\nthe others will get head of the class, and it's so hard to get up\nagain--although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you\nhave when you do get up, haven't you?\"\n\"Well now, I guess you'll manage all right,\" said Matthew, looking at\nAnne's white little face and the dark shadows under her eyes. \"You just\ngo right to bed and have a good sleep. I'll do all the chores.\"\nAnne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it\nwas well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and\ndescended to the kitchen where Marilla, who had arrived home in the\nmeantime, was sitting knitting.\n\"Oh, did you see the Premier?\" exclaimed Anne at once. \"What did he look\nlike Marilla?\"\n\"Well, he never got to be Premier on account of his looks,\" said\nMarilla. \"Such a nose as that man had! But he can speak. I was proud of\nbeing a Conservative. Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no\nuse for him. Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself\nsome blue plum preserve out of the pantry. I guess you're hungry.\nMatthew has been telling me about last night. I must say it was\nfortunate you knew what to do. I wouldn't have had any idea myself, for\nI never saw a case of croup. There now, never mind talking till you've\nhad your dinner. I can tell by the look of you that you're just full up\nwith speeches, but they'll keep.\"\nMarilla had something to tell Anne, but she did not tell it just then\nfor she knew if she did Anne's consequent excitement would lift her\nclear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner.\nNot until Anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did Marilla say:\n\"Mrs. Barry was here this afternoon, Anne. She wanted to see you, but I\nwouldn't wake you up. She says you saved Minnie May's life, and she is\nvery sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. She\nsays she knows now you didn't mean to set Diana drunk, and she hopes\nyou'll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again. You're to go\nover this evening if you like for Diana can't stir outside the door\non account of a bad cold she caught last night. Now, Anne Shirley, for\npity's sake don't fly up into the air.\"\nThe warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was Anne's\nexpression and attitude as she sprang to her feet, her face irradiated\nwith the flame of her spirit.\n\"Oh, Marilla, can I go right now--without washing my dishes? I'll wash\nthem when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so\nunromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.\"\n\"Yes, yes, run along,\" said Marilla indulgently. \"Anne Shirley--are you\ncrazy? Come back this instant and put something on you. I might as well\ncall to the wind. She's gone without a cap or wrap. Look at her tearing\nthrough the orchard with her hair streaming. It'll be a mercy if she\ndoesn't catch her death of cold.\"\nAnne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy",

The tinkles\nof sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through\nthe frosty air, but their music was not sweeter than the song in Anne's\nheart and on her lips.\n\"You see before you a perfectly happy person, Marilla,\" she announced.\n\"I'm perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair. Just at present I\nhave a soul above red hair. Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried and said she\nwas so sorry and she could never repay me. I felt fearfully embarrassed,\nMarilla, but I just said as politely as I could, 'I have no hard\nfeelings for you, Mrs. Barry. I assure you once for all that I did not\nmean to intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the\nmantle of oblivion.' That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn't\nit, Marilla?\"\n\"I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry's head. And Diana\nand I had a lovely afternoon. Diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch\nher aunt over at Carmody taught her. Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but\nus, and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else. Diana\ngave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of\npoetry:\"\n\"If you love me as I love you\nNothing but death can part us two.\"\n\"And that is true, Marilla. We're going to ask Mr. Phillips to let us\nsit together in school again, and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews.\nWe had an elegant tea. Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out,\nMarilla, just as if I was real company. I can't tell you what a thrill\nit gave me. Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before.\nAnd we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of\npreserves, Marilla. And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said 'Pa,\nwhy don't you pass the biscuits to Anne?' It must be lovely to be grown\nup, Marilla, when just being treated as if you were is so nice.\"\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Marilla, with a brief sigh.\n\"Well, anyway, when I am grown up,\" said Anne decidedly, \"I'm always\ngoing to talk to little girls as if they were too, and I'll never laugh\nwhen they use big words. I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts\none's feelings. After tea Diana and I made taffy. The taffy wasn't very\ngood, I suppose because neither Diana nor I had ever made any before.\nDiana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and\nlet it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat\nwalked over one plate and that had to be thrown away. But the making of\nit was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come\nover as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses\nto me all the way down to Lover's Lane. I assure you, Marilla, that I\nfeel like praying tonight and I'm going to think out a special brand-new\nprayer in honor of the occasion.\"",

They only knew that after one frantic rush they\nfound themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs.\n\"Oh, who was it--_what_ was it?\" whispered Anne, her teeth chattering with\ncold and fright.\n\"It was Aunt Josephine,\" said Diana, gasping with laughter. \"Oh, Anne,\nit was Aunt Josephine, however she came to be there. Oh, and I know she\nwill be furious. It's dreadful--it's really dreadful--but did you ever\nknow anything so funny, Anne?\"\n\"Who is your Aunt Josephine?\"\n\"She's father's aunt and she lives in Charlottetown.

I\nsuggested racing to see who would get into bed first.\"\n\"I knew it!\" said Mrs. Lynde, with the exultation of a correct guesser.\n\"I knew that idea came out of your head. Well, it's made a nice lot of\ntrouble, that's what. Old Miss Barry came out to stay for a month, but\nshe declares she won't stay another day and is going right back to town\ntomorrow, Sunday and all as it is. She'd have gone today if they could\nhave taken her. She had promised to pay for a quarter's music lessons\nfor Diana, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a\ntomboy. Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. The\nBarrys must feel cut up. Old Miss Barry is rich and they'd like to keep\non the good side of her. Of course, Mrs. Barry didn't say just that to\nme, but I'm a pretty good judge of human nature, that's what.\"\n\"I'm such an unlucky girl,\" mourned Anne. \"I'm always getting into\nscrapes myself and getting my best friends--people I'd shed my heart's\nblood for--into them too. Can you tell me why it is so, Mrs. Lynde?\"\n\"It's because you're too heedless and impulsive, child, that's what. You\nnever stop to think--whatever comes into your head to say or do you say\nor do it without a moment's reflection.\"\n\"Oh, but that's the best of it,\" protested Anne. \"Something just flashes\ninto your mind, so exciting, and you must out with it. If you stop to\nthink it over you spoil it all. Haven't you never felt that yourself,\nMrs. Lynde?\"\nNo, Mrs. Lynde had not. She shook her head sagely.\n\"You must learn to think a little, Anne, that's what. The proverb you\nneed to go by is 'Look before you leap'--especially into spare-room\nbeds.\"\nMrs. Lynde laughed comfortably over her mild joke, but Anne remained\npensive. She saw nothing to laugh at in the situation, which to her\neyes appeared very serious. When she left Mrs. Lynde's she took her way\nacross the crusted fields to Orchard Slope. Diana met her at the kitchen\ndoor.\n\"Your Aunt Josephine was very cross about it, wasn't she?\" whispered\nAnne.\n\"Yes,\" answered Diana, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance\nover her shoulder at the closed sitting-room door. \"She was fairly\ndancing with rage, Anne. Oh, how she scolded. She said I was the\nworst-behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed\nof the way they had brought me up. She says she won't stay and I'm sure\nI don't care. But Father and Mother do.\"\n\"Why didn't you tell them it was my fault?\" demanded Anne.\n\"It's likely I'd do such a thing, isn't it?\" said Diana with just scorn.\n\"I'm no telltale, Anne Shirley, and anyhow I was just as much to blame\nas you.\"\n\"Well, I'm going in to tell her myself,\" said Anne resolutely.\nDiana stared.\n\"Anne Shirley, you'd never! why--she'll eat you alive!\"\n\"Don't frighten me any more than I am frightened,\" implored Anne. \"I'd\nrather walk up to a cannon's mouth. But I've got to do it, Diana. It\nwas my fault and I've got to confess. I've had practice in confessing,\nfortunately.\"\n\"Well, she's in the room,\" said Diana. \"You can go in if you want to. I\nwouldn't dare. And I don't believe you'll do a bit of good.\"\nWith this encouragement Anne bearded the lion in its den--that is to\nsay, walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly.\nA sharp \"Come in\" followed.\nMiss Josephine Barry, thin, prim, and rigid, was knitting fiercely by\nthe fire, her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her\ngold-rimmed glasses. She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see\nDiana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up\nwith a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.\n\"Who are you?\" demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.\n\"I'm Anne of Green Gables,\" said the small visitor tremulously, clasping\nher hands with her characteristic gesture, \"and I've come to confess, if\nyou please.\"\n\"Confess what?\"\n\"That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I\nsuggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure.\nDiana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it\nis to blame her.\"\n\"Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at\nleast. Such carryings on in a respectable house!\"\n\"But we were only in fun,\" persisted Anne. \"I think you ought to forgive\nus, Miss Barry, now that we've apologized. And anyhow, please forgive\nDiana and let her have her music lessons. Diana's heart is set on her\nmusic lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your\nheart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be\ncross with me. I've been so used in my early days to having people cross\nat me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.\"\nMuch of the snap had gone out of the old lady's eyes by this time\nand was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she still said\nseverely:\n\"I don't think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.\nLittle girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young. You\ndon't know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long\nand arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.\"\n\"I don't _know_, but I can _imagine_,\" said Anne eagerly. \"I'm sure it must\nhave been very disturbing. But then, there is our side of it too. Have\nyou any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have, just put yourself in\nour place. We didn't know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly\nscared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we\ncouldn't sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are\nused to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel\nlike if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.\"\nAll the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed--a\nsound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen\noutside, to give a great gasp of relief.\n\"I'm afraid my imagination is a little rusty--it's so long since I used\nit,\" she said. \"I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as\nmine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell me\nabout yourself.\"\n\"I am very sorry I can't,\" said Anne firmly. \"I would like to, because\nyou seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred\nspirit although you don't look very much like it. But it is my duty to\ngo home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind\nlady who has taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but\nit is very discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on\nthe bed. But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive\nDiana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.\"",

      "text": "DEAR ME, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as\nMrs. Lynde says,\" remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books\ndown on the kitchen table on the last day of June and wiping her red\neyes with a very damp handkerchief. \"Wasn't it fortunate, Marilla, that\nI took an extra handkerchief to school today? I had a presentiment that\nit would be needed.\"\n\"I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you'd require two\nhandkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away,\" said\nMarilla.\n\"I don't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him,\"\nreflected Anne. \"I just cried because all the others did. It was\nRuby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr.\nPhillips, but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she\nburst into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other.\nI tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips\nmade me sit with Gil--with a boy; and the time he spelled my name\nwithout an 'e' on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce\nhe ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he\nhad been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, Marilla, and I\njust had to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how\nglad she'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she'd never\nshed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a\nhandkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because\nshe hadn't brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh,\nMarilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful\nfarewell speech beginning, 'The time has come for us to part.' It was\nvery affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt\ndreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I'd talked in school\nand drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy.\nI can tell you I wished I'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She\nhadn't anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from\nschool. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, 'The time has come\nfor us to part,' and that would start us off again whenever we were in\nany danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one\ncan't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months' vacation\nbefore them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and\nhis wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr.\nPhillips going away I couldn't help taking a little interest in a new\nminister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely,\nof course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally\nlovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the\nminister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she\ndresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue\nmuslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.\nJane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for\na minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark,\nMarilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides,\nshe's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should\nmake allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde\nuntil the manse is ready.\"",

      "text": "If Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde's that evening, was actuated by\nany motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had\nborrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most\nof the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes\nnever expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the\nborrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife,\nwas a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement\nwhere sensations were few and far between.\nOld Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in\nimagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a\nwidower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that\ngossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year\nof his sojourn. In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and\ndeparted amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection\nborn of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his\nshortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a\nvariety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various\ncandidates and \"supplies\" who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on\ntrial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers\nin Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the\ncorner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and\ndiscussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from\nprinciple to criticize ministers in any shape or form.\n\"I don't think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew\" was Anne's final\nsumming up. \"Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his\nworst fault was just like Mr. Bentley's--he had no imagination. And Mr.\nTerry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in\nthe matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology\nwasn't sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,\nbut he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church;\nhe was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,\nmustn't you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive;\nbut Mrs. Lynde says he isn't married, or even engaged, because she made\nspecial inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have\na young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the\ncongregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing\nwoman, isn't she, Matthew? I'm very glad they've called Mr. Allan. I\nliked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he\nmeant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.\nMrs. Lynde says he isn't perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn't\nexpect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year,\nand anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly\non all the points of doctrine. And she knows his wife's people and they\nare most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde\nsays that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman\nmake an ideal combination for a minister's family.\"\nThe new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still\non their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for\ntheir chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start.\nOld and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals,",

She\nsaid we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many.\nI'm good at asking questions, Marilla.\"\n\"I believe you,\" was Marilla's emphatic comment.\n\"Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was\nto be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn't think that was a\nvery proper question to ask because it hadn't any connection with the\nlesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions' den--but Mrs. Allan\njust smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a\nlovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had\ndimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I'm not half so skinny as I was when I\ncame here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence\npeople for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence\nother people for good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew\nbefore that religion was such a cheerful thing. I always thought it\nwas kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan's isn't, and I'd like to be a\nChristian if I could be one like her. I wouldn't want to be one like Mr.\nSuperintendent Bell.\"\n\"It's very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,\" said Marilla\nseverely. \"Mr. Bell is a real good man.\"\n\"Oh, of course he's good,\" agreed Anne, \"but he doesn't seem to get any\ncomfort out of it.

Let me\nsee. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don't say a\nword to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he'd find some\nexcuse to be away that day. He'd got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn't\nmind him, but he's going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new\nminister, and a new minister's wife will frighten him to death.\"\n\"I'll be as secret as the dead,\" assured Anne. \"But oh, Marilla, will",

Sometimes\nI look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don't\ngive up your faith in the dryad!\"\nWednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too\nexcited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of\nher dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short\nof absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary\nmatters that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake.\nWhen she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.\n\"I'm sure I haven't forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you\nthink it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good? I\nused it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of\ngetting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated.\nMrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says\nwe'll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what\nif that cake doesn't rise?\"\n\"We'll have plenty without it\" was Marilla's unimpassioned way of\nlooking at the subject.\nThe cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and\nfeathery as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together\nwith layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it\nand possibly asking for another piece!\n\"You'll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,\" she said. \"Can I\nfix the table with ferns and wild roses?\"\n\"I think that's all nonsense,\" sniffed Marilla. \"In my opinion it's the\neatables that matter and not flummery decorations.\"\n\"Mrs. Barry had _her_ table decorated,\" said Anne, who was not entirely\nguiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, \"and the minister paid her an\nelegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the\npalate.\"\n\"Well, do as you like,\" said Marilla, who was quite determined not to\nbe surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. \"Only mind you leave enough\nroom for the dishes and the food.\"\nAnne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that\nshould leave Mrs. Barry's nowhere. Having abundance of roses and ferns\nand a very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a\nthing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they\nexclaimed in chorus over it loveliness.\n\"It's Anne's doings,\" said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs.\nAllan's approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.\nMatthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness\nand Anne knew how. He had been in such a state of shyness and\nnervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him\nin hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes\nand white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.\nHe never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be\nexpected.\nAll went merry as a marriage bell until Anne's layer cake was passed.\nMrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety,\ndeclined it. But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne's face, said\nsmilingly:\n\"Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose\nfor you.\"\n\"In that case I must sample it,\" laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to\na plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.\nMrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression\ncrossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away\nat it. Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.\n\"Anne Shirley!\" she exclaimed, \"what on earth did you put into that\ncake?\"\n\"Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla,\" cried Anne with a look of\nanguish. \"Oh, isn't it all right?\"\n\"All right! It's simply horrible. Mr. Allan, don't try to eat it. Anne,\ntaste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?\"\n\"Vanilla,\" said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting\nthe cake. \"Only vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking\npowder. I had my suspicions of that bak--\"\n\"Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you\nused.\"\nAnne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially\nfilled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, \"Best Vanilla.\"\nMarilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.\n\"Mercy on us, Anne, you've flavored that cake with _Anodyne Liniment_. I\nbroke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an\nold empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it's partly my fault--I should have\nwarned you--but for pity's sake why couldn't you have smelled it?\"\nAnne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.\n\"I couldn't--I had such a cold!\" and with this she fairly fled to the\ngable chamber, where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who\nrefuses to be comforted.\nPresently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the\nroom.\n\"Oh, Marilla,\" sobbed Anne, without looking up, \"I'm disgraced forever.\nI shall never be able to live this down. It will get out--things always\ndo get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I\nshall have to tell her the truth. I shall always be pointed at as the\ngirl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil--the boys in school\nwill never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark\nof Christian pity don't tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes\nafter this. I'll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but\nI cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she'll think I\ntried to poison her. Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried\nto poison her benefactor. But the liniment isn't poisonous. It's meant\nto be taken internally--although not in cakes. Won't you tell Mrs. Allan\nso, Marilla?\"\n\"Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself,\" said a merry voice.\nAnne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her bed, surveying her with\nlaughing eyes.\n\"My dear little girl, you mustn't cry like this,\" she said, genuinely\ndisturbed by Anne's tragic face. \"Why, it's all just a funny mistake\nthat anybody might make.\"\n\"Oh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake,\" said Anne forlornly. \"And\nI wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan.\"\n\"Yes, I know, dear. And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and\nthoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now,\nyou mustn't cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower\ngarden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I\nwant to see it, for I'm very much interested in flowers.\"\nAnne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it\nwas really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit. Nothing\nmore was said about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away\nAnne found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been\nexpected, considering that terrible incident. Nevertheless, she sighed\ndeeply.\n\"Marilla, isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no\nmistakes in it yet?\"\n\"I'll warrant you'll make plenty in it,\" said Marilla. \"I never saw your\nbeat for making mistakes, Anne.\"\n\"Yes, and well I know it,\" admitted Anne mournfully. \"But have you ever\nnoticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n\"I don't know as that's much benefit when you're always making new\nones.\"\n\"Oh, don't you see, Marilla? There must be a limit to the mistakes one\nperson can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through\nwith them. That's a very comforting thought.\"\n\"Well, you'd better go and give that cake to the pigs,\" said Marilla.",

      "text": "Anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of\n\"etiquette,\" for she came home through the twilight, under a great,\nhigh-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in\na beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting\non the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly\nhead in Marilla's gingham lap.\nA cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims\nof firry western hills and whistling through the poplars. One clear star\nhung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover's\nLane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them\nas she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were\nall tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.\n\"Oh, Marilla, I've had a most _fascinating_ time. I feel that I have not\nlived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never\nbe invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me\nat the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy,\nwith dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a\nseraph. I really think I'd like to be a minister's wife when I grow up,\nMarilla. A minister mightn't mind my red hair because he wouldn't be\nthinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to\nbe naturally good and I'll never be that, so I suppose there's no use in\nthinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others\nare not. I'm one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I'm full of original\nsin. No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success\nof it as those who are naturally good. It's a good deal like geometry,\nI expect. But don't you think the trying so hard ought to count for\nsomething? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her\npassionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs.\nAllan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are\nothers, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You\nknow you _ought_ to love them because they know so much and are such\nactive workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of\nit all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the\nmanse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her name was Laurette\nBradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred\nspirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I\nthink I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs.\nAllan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too.\nMrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the\nSunday-school choir after this. You can't think how I was thrilled at\nthe mere thought. I've longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir,\nas Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to.\nLauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the\nWhite Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta\nsays that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in\naid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White\nSands people to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself\nsomeday. I just gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I\nhad a heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything--about Mrs. Thomas and\nthe twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and\nmy troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs.\nAllan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don't know how that\nencouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what\ndo you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it's\na lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn't that a romantic name? Mrs.\nLynde says they've never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she\nthinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid\nto have a lady teacher, and I really don't see how I'm going to live\nthrough the two weeks before school begins. I'm so impatient to see\nher.\"",

      "text": "ANNE had to live through more than two weeks, as it happened. Almost a\nmonth having elapsed since the liniment cake episode, it was high time\nfor her to get into fresh trouble of some sort, little mistakes, such as\nabsentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls\nin the pantry instead of into the pigs' bucket, and walking clean over\nthe edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative\nreverie, not really being worth counting.\nA week after the tea at the manse Diana Barry gave a party.\n\"Small and select,\" Anne assured Marilla. \"Just the girls in our class.\"\nThey had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea,\nwhen they found themselves in the Barry garden, a little tired of all\ntheir games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might\npresent itself. This presently took the form of \"daring.\"\nDaring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just\nthen. It had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all\nthe silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers\nthereof were \"dared\" to do them would fill a book by themselves.\nFirst of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point\nin the huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis,\nalbeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said\ntree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she\nshould tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the\naforesaid Carrie Sloane. Then Josie Pye dared Jane Andrews to hop on her\nleft leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right\nfoot to the ground; which Jane Andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out\nat the third corner and had to confess herself defeated.\nJosie's triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,\nAnne Shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which\nbounded the garden to the east. Now, to \"walk\" board fences requires\nmore skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who\nhas never tried it. But Josie Pye, if deficient in some qualities\nthat make for popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly\ncultivated, for walking board fences. Josie walked the Barry fence with\nan airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that\nwasn't worth a \"dare.\" Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for\nmost of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things\nthemselves in their efforts to walk fences. Josie descended from her\nperch, flushed with victory, and darted a defiant glance at Anne.\nAnne tossed her red braids.\n\"I don't think it's such a very wonderful thing to walk a little, low,\nboard fence,\" she said. \"I knew a girl in Marysville who could walk the\nridgepole of a roof.\"\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Josie flatly. \"I don't believe anybody could\nwalk a ridgepole. _You_ couldn't, anyhow.\"\n\"Couldn't I?\" cried Anne rashly.\n\"Then I dare you to do it,\" said Josie defiantly. \"I dare you to climb\nup there and walk the ridgepole of Mr. Barry's kitchen roof.\"\nAnne turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done. She\nwalked toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen\nroof. All the fifth-class girls said, \"Oh!\" partly in excitement, partly\nin dismay.\n\"Don't you do it, Anne,\" entreated Diana. \"You'll fall off and be\nkilled. Never mind Josie Pye. It isn't fair to dare anybody to do\nanything so dangerous.\"\n\"I must do it. My honor is at stake,\" said Anne solemnly. \"I shall walk\nthat ridgepole, Diana, or perish in the attempt. If I am killed you are\nto have my pearl bead ring.\"\nAnne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole,\nbalanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing, and started to\nwalk along it, dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up\nin the world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your\nimagination helped you out much. Nevertheless, she managed to take\nseveral steps before the catastrophe came. Then she swayed, lost her\nbalance, stumbled, staggered, and fell, sliding down over the sun-baked\nroof and crashing off it through the tangle of Virginia creeper\nbeneath--all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous,\nterrified shriek.\nIf Anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended\nDiana would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and\nthere. Fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended\ndown over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was\na much less serious thing. Nevertheless, when Diana and the other\ngirls had rushed frantically around the house--except Ruby Gillis, who\nremained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics--they found\nAnne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia\ncreeper.\n\"Anne, are you killed?\" shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her knees\nbeside her friend. \"Oh, Anne, dear Anne, speak just one word to me and\ntell me if you're killed.\"\nTo the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of Josie Pye,\nwho, in spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible\nvisions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of Anne\nShirley's early and tragic death, Anne sat dizzily up and answered\nuncertainly:\n\"No, Diana, I am not killed, but I think I am rendered unconscious.\"\n\"Where?\" sobbed Carrie Sloane. \"Oh, where, Anne?\" Before Anne could\nanswer Mrs. Barry appeared on the scene. At sight of her Anne tried to\nscramble to her feet, but sank back again with a sharp little cry of\npain.\n\"What's the matter? Where have you hurt yourself?\" demanded Mrs. Barry.\n\"My ankle,\" gasped Anne. \"Oh, Diana, please find your father and ask him\nto take me home. I know I can never walk there. And I'm sure I couldn't\nhop so far on one foot when Jane couldn't even hop around the garden.\"\nMarilla was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apples when\nshe saw Mr. Barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope, with Mrs.\nBarry beside him and a whole procession of little girls trailing after\nhim. In his arms he carried Anne, whose head lay limply against his\nshoulder.\nAt that moment Marilla had a revelation. In the sudden stab of fear that\npierced her very heart she realized what Anne had come to mean to her.\nShe would have admitted that she liked Anne--nay, that she was very fond\nof Anne. But now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that Anne\nwas dearer to her than anything else on earth.\n\"Mr. Barry, what has happened to her?\" she gasped, more white and shaken\nthan the self-contained, sensible Marilla had been for many years.\nAnne herself answered, lifting her head.\n\"Don't be very frightened, Marilla. I was walking the ridgepole and I\nfell off. I expect I have sprained my ankle. But, Marilla, I might have\nbroken my neck. Let us look on the bright side of things.\"\n\"I might have known you'd go and do something of the sort when I let you\ngo to that party,\" said Marilla, sharp and shrewish in her very relief.\n\"Bring her in here, Mr. Barry, and lay her on the sofa. Mercy me, the\nchild has gone and fainted!\"\nIt was quite true. Overcome by the pain of her injury, Anne had one more\nof her wishes granted to her. She had fainted dead away.\nMatthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway\ndispatched for the doctor, who in due time came, to discover that the\ninjury was more serious than they had supposed. Anne's ankle was broken.\nThat night, when Marilla went up to the east gable, where a white-faced\ngirl was lying, a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed.\n\"Aren't you very sorry for me, Marilla?\"\n\"It was your own fault,\" said Marilla, twitching down the blind and\nlighting a lamp.\n\"And that is just why you should be sorry for me,\" said Anne, \"because\nthe thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. If I\ncould blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But what would\nyou have done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?\"\n\"I'd have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away. Such\nabsurdity!\" said Marilla.\nAnne sighed.\n\"But you have such strength of mind, Marilla. I haven't. I just felt\nthat I couldn't bear Josie Pye's scorn. She would have crowed over me\nall my life. And I think I have been punished so much that you needn't\nbe very cross with me, Marilla. It's not a bit nice to faint, after all.\nAnd the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle. I won't\nbe able to go around for six or seven weeks and I'll miss the new lady\nteacher. She won't be new any more by the time I'm able to go to school.\nAnd Gil--everybody will get ahead of me in class. Oh, I am an afflicted\nmortal. But I'll try to bear it all bravely if only you won't be cross\nwith me, Marilla.\"\n\"There, there, I'm not cross,\" said Marilla. \"You're an unlucky child,\nthere's no doubt about that; but as you say, you'll have the suffering\nof it. Here now, try and eat some supper.\"\n\"Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?\" said Anne. \"It will\nhelp me through splendidly, I expect. What do people who haven't any\nimagination do when they break their bones, do you suppose, Marilla?\"\nAnne had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during\nthe tedious seven weeks that followed. But she was not solely dependent\non it. She had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of\nthe schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her\nall the happenings in the juvenile world of Avonlea.\n\"Everybody has been so good and kind, Marilla,\" sighed Anne happily,\non the day when she could first limp across the floor. \"It isn't very\npleasant to be laid up; but there is a bright side to it, Marilla. You\nfind out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came\nto see me, and he's really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of\ncourse; but still I like him and I'm awfully sorry I ever criticized his\nprayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into\nthe habit of saying them as if he didn't. He could get over that if he'd\ntake a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard\nI tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me\nall about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem\nso strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my\nimagination has its limits, for I can't imagine _that_. When I try to\nimagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just\nas he looks in Sunday school, only small. Now, it's so easy to imagine\nMrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen\ntimes. Isn't that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a minister's\nwife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to\nhave visit you, too. She never tells you it's your own fault and she\nhopes you'll be a better girl on account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told\nme that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that\nmade me feel she might hope I'd be a better girl but didn't really\nbelieve I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her as\npolitely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk\na ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden\nof remorse all her life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She's been\nover every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad\nwhen I can go to school for I've heard such exciting things about the\nnew teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she\nhas the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses\nbeautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else's in\nAvonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody\nhas to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it's just glorious to\nthink of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie\nhas so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are\npreparing a dialogue, called 'A Morning Visit,' for next Friday. And the\nFriday afternoons they don't have recitations Miss Stacy takes them\nall to the woods for a 'field' day and they study ferns and flowers\nand birds. And they have physical culture exercises every morning and\nevening. Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all\ncomes of having a lady teacher. But I think it must be splendid and I\nbelieve I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit.\"\n\"There's one thing plain to be seen, Anne,\" said Marilla, \"and that is",

There's precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of\nyou. All you want is a good time.\"\n\"Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn't it all right? Of\ncourse it's real nice to be getting up a concert. We're going to have\nsix choruses and Diana is to sing a solo. I'm in two dialogues--'The\nSociety for the Suppression of Gossip' and 'The Fairy Queen.' The boys\nare going to have a dialogue too. And I'm to have two recitations,\nMarilla. I just tremble when I think of it, but it's a nice thrilly kind\nof tremble. And we're to have a tableau at the last--'Faith, Hope and\nCharity.' Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with\nflowing hair. I'm to be Hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes\nuplifted. I'm going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don't be\nalarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one\nof them, and it's really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla.\nJosie Pye is sulky because she didn't get the part she wanted in\nthe dialogue. She wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been\nridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy\nqueens must be slender. Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be\none of her maids of honor. Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is\njust as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie\nsays. I'm to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis\nis going to lend me her slippers because I haven't any of my own. It's\nnecessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You couldn't imagine\na fairy wearing boots, could you? Especially with copper toes? We are\ngoing to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with\npink tissue-paper roses in them. And we are all to march in two by two\nafter the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the\norgan. Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am,\nbut don't you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?\"",

There were some things Matthew\ncould buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be\nat the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl's dress.\nAfter much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson's store\ninstead of William Blair's. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to\nWilliam Blair's; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them\nas to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William\nBlair's two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew\nheld them in absolute dread. He could contrive to deal with them when he\nknew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter\nas this, requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he\nmust be sure of a man behind the counter. So he would go to Lawson's,\nwhere Samuel or his son would wait on him.\nAlas! Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his\nbusiness, had set up a lady clerk also; she was a niece of his wife's\nand a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour,\nbig, rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile. She\nwas dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets\nthat glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands.\nMatthew was covered with confusion at finding her there at all; and\nthose bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop.\n\"What can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert?\" Miss Lucilla Harris\ninquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with both\nhands.\n\"Have you any--any--any--well now, say any garden rakes?\" stammered\nMatthew.\nMiss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she might, to hear a man\ninquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December.\n\"I believe we have one or two left over,\" she said, \"but they're\nupstairs in the lumber room. I'll go and see.\" During her absence\nMatthew collected his scattered senses for another effort.\nWhen Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired:\n\"Anything else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert?\" Matthew took his courage in\nboth hands and replied: \"Well now, since you suggest it, I might as\nwell--take--that is--look at--buy some--some hayseed.\"\nMiss Harris had heard Matthew Cuthbert called odd. She now concluded\nthat he was entirely crazy.\n\"We only keep hayseed in the spring,\" she explained loftily. \"We've none\non hand just now.\"\n\"Oh, certainly--certainly--just as you say,\" stammered unhappy\nMatthew, seizing the rake and making for the door. At the threshold he\nrecollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back.\nWhile Miss Harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for\na final desperate attempt.\n\"Well now--if it isn't too much trouble--I might as well--that is--I'd\nlike to look at--at--some sugar.\"\n\"White or brown?\" queried Miss Harris patiently.\n\"Oh--well now--brown,\" said Matthew feebly.\n\"There's a barrel of it over there,\" said Miss Harris, shaking her\nbangles at it. \"It's the only kind we have.\"\n\"I'll--I'll take twenty pounds of it,\" said Matthew, with beads of\nperspiration standing on his forehead.\nMatthew had driven halfway home before he was his own man again. It had\nbeen a gruesome experience, but it served him right, he thought, for\ncommitting the heresy of going to a strange store. When he reached\nhome he hid the rake in the tool house, but the sugar he carried in to\nMarilla.",

      "text": "Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world. It had been a very\nmild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but\njust enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne\npeeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs\nin the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches\nand wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were\nstretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that\nwas glorious. Anne ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed\nthrough Green Gables.\n\"Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn't it a lovely\nChristmas? I'm so glad it's white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn't\nseem real, does it? I don't like green Christmases. They're not\ngreen--they're just nasty faded browns and grays. What makes people call\nthem green? Why--why--Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew!\"\nMatthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and\nheld it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be\ncontemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene\nout of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air.\nAnne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty\nit was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt\nwith dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the\nmost fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.\nBut the sleeves--they were the crowning glory! Long elbow cuffs, and\nabove them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of\nbrown-silk ribbon.\n\"That's a Christmas present for you, Anne,\" said Matthew shyly.\n\"Why--why--Anne, don't you like it? Well now--well now.\"\nFor Anne's eyes had suddenly filled with tears.\n\"Like it! Oh, Matthew!\" Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped\nher hands. \"Matthew, it's perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank you\nenough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy\ndream.\"\n\"Well, well, let us have breakfast,\" interrupted Marilla. \"I must say,\nAnne, I don't think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it\nfor you, see that you take good care of it. There's a hair ribbon Mrs.\nLynde left for you. It's brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in.\"\n\"I don't see how I'm going to eat breakfast,\" said Anne rapturously.\n\"Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I'd rather\nfeast my eyes on that dress. I'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still\nfashionable. It did seem to me that I'd never get over it if they went\nout before I had a dress with them. I'd never have felt quite satisfied,\nyou see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel\nthat I ought to be a very good girl indeed. It's at times like this I'm\nsorry I'm not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will\nbe in future. But somehow it's hard to carry out your resolutions when\nirresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort\nafter this.\"",

      "text": "All the Avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day, for the\nhall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held.\nThe concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success. The\nlittle hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but\nAnne was the bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in\nthe shape of Josie Pye, dared not deny.\n\"Oh, hasn't it been a brilliant evening?\" sighed Anne, when it was all\nover and she and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry\nsky.\n\"Everything went off very well,\" said Diana practically. \"I guess we\nmust have made as much as ten dollars. Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to\nsend an account of it to the Charlottetown papers.\"\n\"Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? It makes me thrill to\nthink of it. Your solo was perfectly elegant, Diana. I felt prouder than\nyou did when it was encored. I just said to myself, 'It is my dear bosom\nfriend who is so honored.'\"\n\"Well, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne. That sad one\nwas simply splendid.\"\n\"Oh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan called out my name I really\ncannot tell how I ever got up on that platform. I felt as if a million\neyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I\nwas sure I couldn't begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed\nsleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves,\nDiana. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so\nfar away. I just felt like a parrot. It's providential that I practiced\nthose recitations so often up in the garret, or I'd never have been able\nto get through. Did I groan all right?\"\n\"Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely,\" assured Diana.\n\"I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down. It was\nsplendid to think I had touched somebody's heart. It's so romantic\nto take part in a concert, isn't it? Oh, it's been a very memorable\noccasion indeed.\"\n\"Wasn't the boys' dialogue fine?\" said Diana. \"Gilbert Blythe was just\nsplendid. Anne, I do think it's awful mean the way you treat Gil. Wait\ntill I tell you. When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue\none of your roses fell out of your hair. I saw Gil pick it up and put\nit in his breast pocket. There now. You're so romantic that I'm sure you\nought to be pleased at that.\"\n\"It's nothing to me what that person does,\" said Anne loftily. \"I simply\nnever waste a thought on him, Diana.\"\nThat night Marilla and Matthew, who had been out to a concert for the\nfirst time in twenty years, sat for a while by the kitchen fire after\nAnne had gone to bed.\n\"Well now, I guess our Anne did as well as any of them,\" said Matthew\nproudly.\n\"Yes, she did,\" admitted Marilla. \"She's a bright child, Matthew. And\nshe looked real nice too. I've been kind of opposed to this concert\nscheme, but I suppose there's no real harm in it after all. Anyhow, I\nwas proud of Anne tonight, although I'm not going to tell her so.\"\n\"Well now, I was proud of her and I did tell her so 'fore she went\nupstairs,\" said Matthew. \"We must see what we can do for her some of\nthese days, Marilla. I guess she'll need something more than Avonlea\nschool by and by.\"\n\"There's time enough to think of that,\" said Marilla. \"She's only\nthirteen in March. Though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a\nbig girl. Mrs. Lynde made that dress a mite too long, and it makes Anne\nlook so tall. She's quick to learn and I guess the best thing we can do\nfor her will be to send her to Queen's after a spell. But nothing need\nbe said about that for a year or two yet.\"",

To Anne in particular things seemed fearfully flat, stale, and\nunprofitable after the goblet of excitement she had been sipping for\nweeks. Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway\ndays before the concert? At first, as she told Diana, she did not really\nthink she could.\n\"I'm positively certain, Diana, that life can never be quite the\nsame again as it was in those olden days,\" she said mournfully, as if\nreferring to a period of at least fifty years back. \"Perhaps after a\nwhile I'll get used to it, but I'm afraid concerts spoil people for\neveryday life. I suppose that is why Marilla disapproves of them.\nMarilla is such a sensible woman. It must be a great deal better to be\nsensible; but still, I don't believe I'd really want to be a sensible\nperson, because they are so unromantic. Mrs. Lynde says there is no\ndanger of my ever being one, but you can never tell. I feel just now\nthat I may grow up to be sensible yet. But perhaps that is only because\nI'm tired. I simply couldn't sleep last night for ever so long. I just\nlay awake and imagined the concert over and over again. That's one\nsplendid thing about such affairs--it's so lovely to look back to them.\"\nEventually, however, Avonlea school slipped back into its old groove\nand took up its old interests. To be sure, the concert left traces. Ruby\nGillis and Emma White, who had quarreled over a point of precedence in\ntheir platform seats, no longer sat at the same desk, and a promising\nfriendship of three years was broken up. Josie Pye and Julia Bell did\nnot \"speak\" for three months, because Josie Pye had told Bessie Wright\nthat Julia Bell's bow when she got up to recite made her think of a\nchicken jerking its head, and Bessie told Julia. None of the Sloanes\nwould have any dealings with the Bells, because the Bells had declared\nthat the Sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the Sloanes had\nretorted that the Bells were not capable of doing the little they had to\ndo properly. Finally, Charlie Sloane fought Moody Spurgeon MacPherson,\nbecause Moody Spurgeon had said that Anne Shirley put on airs about\nher recitations, and Moody Spurgeon was \"licked\"; consequently Moody\nSpurgeon's sister, Ella May, would not \"speak\" to Anne Shirley all the\nrest of the winter. With the exception of these trifling frictions, work\nin Miss Stacy's little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness.",

On Anne's birthday they were tripping lightly\ndown it, keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss\nStacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on \"A\nWinter's Walk in the Woods,\" and it behooved them to be observant.\n\"Just think, Diana, I'm thirteen years old today,\" remarked Anne in an\nawed voice. \"I can scarcely realize that I'm in my teens. When I woke\nthis morning it seemed to me that everything must be different. You've\nbeen thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn't seem such a novelty\nto you as it does to me. It makes life seem so much more interesting.\nIn two more years I'll be really grown up. It's a great comfort to think\nthat I'll be able to use big words then without being laughed at.\"\n\"Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she's fifteen,\"\nsaid Diana.\n\"Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus,\" said Anne disdainfully.\n\"She's actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a\ntake-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. But I'm afraid that is an\nuncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable\nspeeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don't they? I\nsimply can't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech,\nso I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I'm trying to\nbe as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she's perfect.\nMr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she\ntreads on and she doesn't really think it right for a minister to\nset his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even\nministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody\nelse. I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting\nsins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it's proper\nto talk about on Sundays and that is one of them. My besetting sin is\nimagining too much and forgetting my duties. I'm striving very hard\nto overcome it and now that I'm really thirteen perhaps I'll get on\nbetter.\"\n\"In four more years we'll be able to put our hair up,\" said Diana.\n\"Alice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I think\nthat's ridiculous. I shall wait until I'm seventeen.\"\n\"If I had Alice Bell's crooked nose,\" said Anne decidedly, \"I\nwouldn't--but there! I won't say what I was going to because it was\nextremely uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and\nthat's vanity. I'm afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I\nheard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to\nme. Oh, Diana, look, there's a rabbit. That's something to remember for\nour woods composition. I really think the woods are just as lovely in\nwinter as in summer. They're so white and still, as if they were asleep\nand dreaming pretty dreams.\"\n\"I won't mind writing that composition when its time comes,\" sighed\nDiana. \"I can manage to write about the woods, but the one we're to\nhand in Monday is terrible.

      "text": "This was how the story club came into existence. It was limited to Diana\nand Anne at first, but soon it was extended to include Jane Andrews\nand Ruby Gillis and one or two others who felt that their imaginations\nneeded cultivating. No boys were allowed in it--although Ruby Gillis\nopined that their admission would make it more exciting--and each member\nhad to produce one story a week.\n\"It's extremely interesting,\" Anne told Marilla. \"Each girl has to read\nher story out loud and then we talk it over. We are going to keep them\nall sacredly and have them to read to our descendants. We each write\nunder a nom-de-plume. Mine is Rosamond Montmorency. All the girls\ndo pretty well. Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental. She puts too much\nlovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too\nlittle. Jane never puts any because she says it makes her feel so silly\nwhen she had to read it out loud. Jane's stories are extremely sensible.\nThen Diana puts too many murders into hers. She says most of the time\nshe doesn't know what to do with the people so she kills them off to get\nrid of them. I mostly always have to tell them what to write about, but\nthat isn't hard for I've millions of ideas.\"\n\"I think this story-writing business is the foolishest yet,\" scoffed\nMarilla. \"You'll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time\nthat should be put on your lessons. Reading stories is bad enough but\nwriting them is worse.\"\n\"But we're so careful to put a moral into them all, Marilla,\" explained\nAnne. \"I insist upon that. All the good people are rewarded and all\nthe bad ones are suitably punished. I'm sure that must have a wholesome\neffect. The moral is the great thing. Mr. Allan says so. I read one of\nmy stories to him and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was\nexcellent. Only they laughed in the wrong places. I like it better when\npeople cry. Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic\nparts. Diana wrote her Aunt Josephine about our club and her Aunt\nJosephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories. So\nwe copied out four of our very best and sent them. Miss Josephine Barry\nwrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life. That\nkind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost\neverybody died. But I'm glad Miss Barry liked them. It shows our club\nis doing some good in the world. Mrs. Allan says that ought to be our\nobject in everything. I do really try to make it my object but I forget\nso often when I'm having fun. I hope I shall be a little like Mrs. Allan\nwhen I grow up. Do you think there is any prospect of it, Marilla?\"\n\"I shouldn't say there was a great deal\" was Marilla's encouraging\nanswer. \"I'm sure Mrs. Allan was never such a silly, forgetful little\ngirl as you are.\"\n\"No; but she wasn't always so good as she is now either,\" said Anne\nseriously. \"She told me so herself--that is, she said she was a dreadful\nmischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes. I felt\nso encouraged when I heard that. Is it very wicked of me, Marilla,\nto feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and\nmischievous? Mrs. Lynde says it is. Mrs. Lynde says she always feels\nshocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how\nsmall they were. Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that\nwhen he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt's pantry\nand she never had any respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldn't\nhave felt that way. I'd have thought that it was real noble of him to\nconfess it, and I'd have thought what an encouraging thing it would be\nfor small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them\nto know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it.\nThat's how I'd feel, Marilla.\"\n\"The way I feel at present, Anne,\" said Marilla, \"is that it's high time\nyou had those dishes washed. You've taken half an hour longer than\nyou should with all your chattering. Learn to work first and talk\nafterwards.\"",

He had a big box\nfull of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to\nmake enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany. He\nspoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy\nsomething from him to help him in such a worthy object. Then all at once\nI saw the bottle of hair dye.

But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I\nhad only fifty cents left out of my chicken money. I think the peddler\nhad a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, he'd sell it\nfor fifty cents and that was just giving it away. So I bought it, and as\nsoon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush\nas the directions said.

I suppose the first thing is to\ngive your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good.\"\nAccordingly, Anne washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and\nwater, but for all the difference it made she might as well have been\nscouring its original red.

Marilla, I _cannot_ face Josie Pye. I am the unhappiest\ngirl in Prince Edward Island.\"\nAnne's unhappiness continued for a week. During that time she went\nnowhere and shampooed her hair every day. Diana alone of outsiders knew\nthe fatal secret, but she promised solemnly never to tell, and it may\nbe stated here and now that she kept her word. At the end of the week\nMarilla said decidedly:\n\"It's no use, Anne. That is fast dye if ever there was any. Your hair\nmust be cut off; there is no other way. You can't go out with it looking\nlike that.\"\nAnne's lips quivered, but she realized the bitter truth of Marilla's\nremarks. With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors.\n\"Please cut it off at once, Marilla, and have it over. Oh, I feel that\nmy heart is broken. This is such an unromantic affliction. The girls in\nbooks lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good\ndeed, and I'm sure I wouldn't mind losing my hair in some such fashion\nhalf so much. But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut\noff because you've dyed it a dreadful color, is there? I'm going to weep\nall the time you're cutting it off, if it won't interfere. It seems such\na tragic thing.\"\nAnne wept then, but later on, when she went upstairs and looked in the\nglass, she was calm with despair. Marilla had done her work thoroughly\nand it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible.\nThe result was not becoming, to state the case as mildly as may be. Anne",

It's fun\nthen. But to lie down and pretend I was dead--I just couldn't. I'd die\nreally of fright.\"\n\"Of course it would be romantic,\" conceded Jane Andrews, \"but I know I\ncouldn't keep still. I'd be popping up every minute or so to see where I\nwas and if I wasn't drifting too far out. And you know, Anne, that would\nspoil the effect.\"\n\"But it's so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine,\" mourned Anne. \"I'm\nnot afraid to float down and I'd love to be Elaine. But it's ridiculous\njust the same. Ruby ought to be Elaine because she is so fair and has\nsuch lovely long golden hair--Elaine had 'all her bright hair streaming\ndown,' you know. And Elaine was the lily maid. Now, a red-haired person\ncannot be a lily maid.\"\n\"Your complexion is just as fair as Ruby's,\" said Diana earnestly, \"and\nyour hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it.\"\n\"Oh, do you really think so?\" exclaimed Anne, flushing sensitively with\ndelight. \"I've sometimes thought it was myself--but I never dared to ask\nanyone for fear she would tell me it wasn't. Do you think it could be\ncalled auburn now, Diana?\"\n\"Yes, and I think it is real pretty,\" said Diana, looking admiringly at\nthe short, silky curls that clustered over Anne's head and were held in\nplace by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow.\nThey were standing on the bank of the pond, below Orchard Slope, where\na little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank; at its tip\nwas a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience\nof fishermen and duck hunters. Ruby and Jane were spending the midsummer\nafternoon with Diana, and Anne had come over to play with them.\nAnne and Diana had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about\nthe pond. Idlewild was a thing of the past, Mr. Bell having ruthlessly\ncut down the little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring.\nAnne had sat among the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the\nromance of it; but she was speedily consoled, for, after all, as she and\nDiana said, big girls of thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for\nsuch childish amusements as playhouses, and there were more fascinating\nsports to be found about the pond. It was splendid to fish for trout\nover the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the\nlittle flat-bottomed dory Mr. Barry kept for duck shooting.\nIt was Anne's idea that they dramatize Elaine. They had studied\nTennyson's poem in school the preceding winter, the Superintendent of\nEducation having prescribed it in the English course for the Prince\nEdward Island schools. They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to\npieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all\nleft in it for them, but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and\nGuinevere and King Arthur had become very real people to them, and Anne\nwas devoured by secret regret that she had not been born in Camelot.\nThose days, she said, were so much more romantic than the present.\nAnne's plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if\nthe flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down\nwith the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another\nheadland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond. They had often\ngone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing\nElaine.\n\"Well, I'll be Elaine,\" said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for, although\nshe would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet\nher artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her\nlimitations made impossible. \"Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane\nwill be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot. But first you must be the",

Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none,\nbut an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent\nsubstitute.

For a moment they stood still, white as sheets,\nfrozen with horror at the tragedy; then, shrieking at the tops of\ntheir voices, they started on a frantic run up through the woods, never\npausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge.\nAnne, clinging desperately to her precarious foothold, saw their flying\nforms and heard their shrieks. Help would soon come, but meanwhile her\nposition was a very uncomfortable one.\nThe minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily\nmaid. Why didn't somebody come? Where had the girls gone? Suppose they\nhad fainted, one and all! Suppose nobody ever came! Suppose she grew so\ntired and cramped that she could hold on no longer! Anne looked at the\nwicked green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and\nshivered. Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome\npossibilities to her.\nThen, just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her\narms and wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the\nbridge in Harmon Andrews's dory!\nGilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white\nscornful face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also\nscornful gray eyes.\n\"Anne Shirley! How on earth did you get there?\" he exclaimed.\nWithout waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended\nhis hand. There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blythe's\nhand, scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious,\nin the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe. It was\ncertainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!\n\"What has happened, Anne?\" asked Gilbert, taking up his oars.\n\"We were playing Elaine,\" explained Anne frigidly, without even looking\nat her rescuer, \"and I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge--I\nmean the flat. The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile.\nThe girls went for help. Will you be kind enough to row me to the\nlanding?\"\nGilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance,\nsprang nimbly on shore.\n\"I'm very much obliged to you,\" she said haughtily as she turned away.\nBut Gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand\non her arm.",

Besides, it's so long ago. I think\nyour hair is awfully pretty now--honest I do. Let's be friends.\"\nFor a moment Anne hesitated. She had an odd, newly awakened\nconsciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy,\nhalf-eager expression in Gilbert's hazel eyes was something that was\nvery good to see. Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat. But the\nbitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering\ndetermination. That scene of two years before flashed back into her\nrecollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. Gilbert had\ncalled her \"carrots\" and had brought about her disgrace before the whole\nschool. Her resentment, which to other and older people might be as\nlaughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time\nseemingly. She hated Gilbert Blythe! She would never forgive him!\n\"No,\" she said coldly, \"I shall never be friends with you, Gilbert\nBlythe; and I don't want to be!\"\n\"All right!\" Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his\ncheeks. \"I'll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley. And I\ndon't care either!\"\nHe pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and Anne went up the steep,\nferny little path under the maples. She held her head very high, but\nshe was conscious of an odd feeling of regret. She almost wished she had\nanswered Gilbert differently. Of course, he had insulted her terribly,\nbut still--! Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to\nsit down and have a good cry. She was really quite unstrung, for the\nreaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.\nHalfway up the path she met Jane and Diana rushing back to the pond in\na state narrowly removed from positive frenzy. They had found nobody at\nOrchard Slope, both Mr. and Mrs. Barry being away. Here Ruby Gillis had\nsuccumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she\nmight, while Jane and Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the\nbrook to Green Gables. There they had found nobody either, for Marilla\nhad gone to Carmody and Matthew was making hay in the back field.\n\"Oh, Anne,\" gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former's neck\nand weeping with relief and delight, \"oh, Anne--we thought--you\nwere--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because we had made--you\nbe--Elaine. And Ruby is in hysterics--oh, Anne, how did you escape?\"\n\"I climbed up on one of the piles,\" explained Anne wearily, \"and Gilbert\nBlythe came along in Mr. Andrews's dory and brought me to land.\"\n\"Oh, Anne, how splendid of him! Why, it's so romantic!\" said Jane,\nfinding breath enough for utterance at last. \"Of course you'll speak to\nhim after this.\"\n\"Of course I won't,\" flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old\nspirit. \"And I don't want ever to hear the word 'romantic' again, Jane\nAndrews. I'm awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls. It is all my\nfault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do\ngets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We've gone and lost your\nfather's flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we'll not be\nallowed to row on the pond any more.\"",

As\nCharlottetown was thirty miles away and Mr. Barry wished to go and\nreturn the same day, it was necessary to make a very early start. But\nAnne counted it all joy, and was up before sunrise on Tuesday morning.\nA glance from her window assured her that the day would be fine, for\nthe eastern sky behind the firs of the Haunted Wood was all silvery\nand cloudless. Through the gap in the trees a light was shining in the\nwestern gable of Orchard Slope, a token that Diana was also up.\nAnne was dressed by the time Matthew had the fire on and had the\nbreakfast ready when Marilla came down, but for her own part was much\ntoo excited to eat. After breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were\ndonned, and Anne hastened over the brook and up through the firs to\nOrchard Slope. Mr. Barry and Diana were waiting for her, and they were\nsoon on the road.\nIt was a long drive, but Anne and Diana enjoyed every minute of it. It\nwas delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red\nsunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields. The air was\nfresh and crisp, and little smoke-blue mists curled through the valleys\nand floated off from the hills. Sometimes the road went through woods\nwhere maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners; sometimes it\ncrossed rivers on bridges that made Anne's flesh cringe with the old,\nhalf-delightful fear; sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed\nby a little cluster of weather-gray fishing huts; again it mounted to\nhills whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty-blue sky could be\nseen; but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss. It was\nalmost noon when they reached town and found their way to \"Beechwood.\"",

From first to last it was crowded with delights.\nOn Wednesday Miss Barry took them to the Exhibition grounds and kept\nthem there all day.\n\"It was splendid,\" Anne related to Marilla later on. \"I never imagined\nanything so interesting. I don't really know which department was the\nmost interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the\nfancywork best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was\nreal glad she did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I'm\nimproving, don't you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie's\nsuccess? Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples\nand Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig. Diana said she thought it was\nridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs,\nbut I don't see why. Do you? She said she would always think of it after\nthis when he was praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a\nprize for painting, and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter\nand cheese. So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn't it? Mrs.\nLynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her\nuntil I saw her familiar face among all those strangers. There\nwere thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel dreadfully\ninsignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see\nthe horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn't go; she said horse racing was an\nabomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty\nto set a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I\ndon't believe Mrs. Lynde's absence would ever be noticed. I don't think,\nthough, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_\nawfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me\nten cents that the red horse would win. I didn't believe he would, but\nI refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about\neverything, and I felt sure it wouldn't do to tell her that. It's always\nwrong to do anything you can't tell the minister's wife. It's as good as\nan extra conscience to have a minister's wife for your friend. And I was\nvery glad I didn't bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and I would have\nlost ten cents. So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a man\ngo up in a balloon. I'd love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would\nbe simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten\ncents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you. Miss Barry gave\nDiana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told. Mine was that I\nwould marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go\nacross water to live. I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after\nthat, but I didn't care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose\nit's too early to be looking out for him yet. Oh, it was a\nnever-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla. I was so tired I couldn't sleep at",

Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears.\nI was so sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn't see\nhow I was ever to return to common life again.

But Miss Barry was pleased, and she stood on her\nveranda and watched the buggy out of sight. Then she went back into her\nbig house with a sigh. It seemed very lonely, lacking those fresh young\nlives. Miss Barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must\nbe told, and had never cared much for anybody but herself. She valued\npeople only as they were of service to her or amused her. Anne had\namused her, and consequently stood high in the old lady's good graces.\nBut Miss Barry found herself thinking less about Anne's quaint speeches\nthan of her fresh enthusiasms, her transparent emotions, her little\nwinning ways, and the sweetness of her eyes and lips.\n\"I thought Marilla Cuthbert was an old fool when I heard she'd adopted\na girl out of an orphan asylum,\" she said to herself, \"but I guess she\ndidn't make much of a mistake after all. If I'd a child like Anne in the\nhouse all the time I'd be a better and happier woman.\"\nAnne and Diana found the drive home as pleasant as the drive\nin--pleasanter, indeed, since there was the delightful consciousness of\nhome waiting at the end of it. It was sunset when they passed through\nWhite Sands and turned into the shore road. Beyond, the Avonlea hills\ncame out darkly against the saffron sky. Behind them the moon was rising\nout of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light.\nEvery little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing\nripples. The waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them, and\nthe tang of the sea was in the strong, fresh air.\n\"Oh, but it's good to be alive and to be going home,\" breathed Anne.\nWhen she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of\nGreen Gables winked her a friendly welcome back, and through the open\ndoor shone the hearth fire, sending out its warm red glow athwart the\nchilly autumn night. Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen,\nwhere a hot supper was waiting on the table.\n\"So you've got back?\" said Marilla, folding up her knitting.\n\"Yes, and oh, it's so good to be back,\" said Anne joyously. \"I could\nkiss everything, even to the clock. Marilla, a broiled chicken! You\ndon't mean to say you cooked that for me!\"\n\"Yes, I did,\" said Marilla. \"I thought you'd be hungry after such\na drive and need something real appetizing. Hurry and take off your\nthings, and we'll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in. I'm glad\nyou've got back, I must say. It's been fearful lonesome here without\nyou, and I never put in four longer days.\"\nAfter supper Anne sat before the fire between Matthew and Marilla, and\ngave them a full account of her visit.\n\"I've had a splendid time,\" she concluded happily, \"and I feel that it\nmarks an epoch in my life. But the best of it all was the coming home.\"",

She had been reading, but her book had slipped\nto the floor, and now she was dreaming, with a smile on her parted lips.\nGlittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and\nrainbows of her lively fancy; adventures wonderful and enthralling\nwere happening to her in cloudland--adventures that always turned out\ntriumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual\nlife.\nMarilla looked at her with a tenderness that would never have been\nsuffered to reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling\nof fireshine and shadow. The lesson of a love that should display itself\neasily in spoken word and open look was one Marilla could never learn.\nBut she had learned to love this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection\nall the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness.

Oh, I'm so sorry I wasn't in. Why didn't you call me, Marilla?\nDiana and I were only over in the Haunted Wood. It's lovely in the woods\nnow. All the little wood things--the ferns and the satin leaves and the\ncrackerberries--have gone to sleep, just as if somebody had tucked them\naway until spring under a blanket of leaves. I think it was a little\ngray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last\nmoonlight night and did it. Diana wouldn't say much about that, though.\nDiana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about\nimagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood. It had a very bad effect on\nDiana's imagination. It blighted it. Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a\nblighted being. I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted, and Ruby\nsaid she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her. Ruby\nGillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse\nshe is. Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn't do to\ndrag them into everything, does it? Diana and I are thinking seriously\nof promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids\nand live together forever. Diana hasn't quite made up her mind though,\nbecause she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild,\ndashing, wicked young man and reform him. Diana and I talk a great deal\nabout serious subjects now, you know. We feel that we are so much older\nthan we used to be that it isn't becoming to talk of childish matters.\nIt's such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen, Marilla. Miss Stacy took\nall us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday, and\ntalked to us about it. She said we couldn't be too careful what habits\nwe formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens, because by the time\nwe were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid\nfor our whole future life. And she said if the foundation was shaky we\ncould never build anything really worth while on it. Diana and I talked\nthe matter over coming home from school. We felt extremely solemn,\nMarilla. And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and\nform respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as\npossible, so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be\nproperly developed. It's perfectly appalling to think of being twenty,\nMarilla. It sounds so fearfully old and grown up. But why was Miss Stacy",

      "text": "\"That is what I want to tell you, Anne, if you'll ever give me a chance\nto get a word in edgewise. She was talking about you.\"\n\"About me?\" Anne looked rather scared. Then she flushed and exclaimed:\n\"Oh, I know what she was saying. I meant to tell you, Marilla, honestly\nI did, but I forgot. Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school\nyesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian\nhistory. Jane Andrews lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour,\nand I had just got to the chariot race when school went in. I was simply\nwild to know how it turned out--although I felt sure Ben Hur must win,\nbecause it wouldn't be poetical justice if he didn't--so I spread the\nhistory open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and\nmy knee. I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know,\nwhile all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it\nthat I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at\nonce I just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so\nreproachful-like. I can't tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla,\nespecially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur\naway, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and\ntalked to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I\nwas wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly,\nI was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a\nhistory when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that\nmoment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I\ncried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I'd never do such\na thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking\nat Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned\nout. But Miss Stacy said she wouldn't require that, and she forgave me\nfreely. So I think it wasn't very kind of her to come up here to you\nabout it after all.\"\n\"Miss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me, Anne, and its only your\nguilty conscience that's the matter with you. You have no business to be\ntaking storybooks to school. You read too many novels anyhow. When I was\na girl I wasn't so much as allowed to look at a novel.\"\n\"Oh, how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it's really such a religious\nbook?\" protested Anne. \"Of course it's a little too exciting to be\nproper reading for Sunday, and I only read it on weekdays. And I never\nread _any_ book now unless either Miss Stacy or Mrs. Allan thinks it is a\nproper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read. Miss Stacy\nmade me promise that. She found me reading a book one day called, The\nLurid Mystery of the Haunted Hall. It was one Ruby Gillis had lent me,\nand, oh, Marilla, it was so fascinating and creepy. It just curdled the\nblood in my veins. But Miss Stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome\nbook, and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it. I\ndidn't mind promising not to read any more like it, but it was _agonizing_\nto give back that book without knowing how it turned out. But my love\nfor Miss Stacy stood the test and I did. It's really wonderful, Marilla,\nwhat you can do when you're truly anxious to please a certain person.\"\n\"Well, I guess I'll light the lamp and get to work,\" said Marilla. \"I\nsee plainly that you don't want to hear what Miss Stacy had to say.\nYou're more interested in the sound of your own tongue than in anything\nelse.\"\n\"Oh, indeed, Marilla, I do want to hear it,\" cried Anne contritely. \"I\nwon't say another word--not one. I know I talk too much, but I am really\ntrying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if you only\nknew how many things I want to say and don't, you'd give me some credit\nfor it. Please tell me, Marilla.\"\n\"Well, Miss Stacy wants to organize a class among her advanced students\nwho mean to study for the entrance examination into Queen's. She intends\nto give them extra lessons for an hour after school. And she came to ask\nMatthew and me if we would like to have you join it. What do you think\nabout it yourself, Anne? Would you like to go to Queen's and pass for a\nteacher?\"\n\"Oh, Marilla!\" Anne straightened to her knees and clasped her hands.\n\"It's been the dream of my life--that is, for the last six months, ever\nsince Ruby and Jane began to talk of studying for the Entrance. But I\ndidn't say anything about it, because I supposed it would be perfectly\nuseless. I'd love to be a teacher. But won't it be dreadfully expensive?\nMr. Andrews says it cost him one hundred and fifty dollars to put Prissy\nthrough, and Prissy wasn't a dunce in geometry.\"\n\"I guess you needn't worry about that part of it. When Matthew and I\ntook you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you\nand give you a good education. I believe in a girl being fitted to earn\nher own living whether she ever has to or not. You'll always have a home\nat Green Gables as long as Matthew and I are here, but nobody knows what\nis going to happen in this uncertain world, and it's just as well to be\nprepared. So you can join the Queen's class if you like, Anne.\"",

This seemed nothing short of a\ncalamity to Anne. Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the\ncroup, had she and Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when\nthe Queen's class first remained in school for the extra lessons and\nAnne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through\nthe Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep\nher seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. A lump\ncame into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her\nuplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. Not for worlds\nwould Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears.\n\"But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of\ndeath, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go\nout alone,\" she said mournfully that night. \"I thought how splendid it\nwould have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance,\ntoo. But we can't have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs.\nLynde says. Mrs. Lynde isn't exactly a comforting person sometimes, but\nthere's no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the\nQueen's class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby\nare just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their\nambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets\nthrough, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote\nher whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid\na salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything, and growls\nif you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks\nfrom mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a\nperfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she\nis just going to college for education's sake, because she won't have to\nearn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who\nare living on charity--_they_ have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to\nbe a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn't be anything else with a name\nlike that to live up to. I hope it isn't wicked of me, Marilla, but\nreally the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.\nHe's such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little\nblue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will\nbe more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he's\ngoing to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde\nsays he'll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest\npeople, and it's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.\"\n\"What is Gilbert Blythe going to be?\" queried Marilla, seeing that Anne\nwas opening her C\u00e6sar.\n\"I don't happen to know what Gilbert Blythe's ambition in life is--if he\nhas any,\" said Anne scornfully.\nThere was open rivalry between Gilbert and Anne now. Previously the\nrivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt\nthat Gilbert was as determined to be first in class as Anne was. He was\na foeman worthy of her steel. The other members of the class tacitly\nacknowledged their superiority, and never dreamed of trying to compete\nwith them.\nSince the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea\nfor forgiveness, Gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry,\nhad evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of Anne Shirley. He\ntalked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with\nthem, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the\nother of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley\nhe simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be\nignored. It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head\nthat she did not care. Deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart\nshe knew that she did care, and that if she had that chance of the Lake\nof Shining Waters again she would answer very differently. All at\nonce, as it seemed, and to her secret dismay, she found that the old\nresentment she had cherished against him was gone--gone just when she\nmost needed its sustaining power. It was in vain that she recalled every\nincident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel\nthe old satisfying anger. That day by the pond had witnessed its last\nspasmodic flicker. Anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten\nwithout knowing it. But it was too late.\nAnd at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should\never suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn't been\nso proud and horrid! She determined to \"shroud her feelings in deepest\noblivion,\" and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so\nsuccessfully that Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as\nhe seemed, could not console himself with any belief that Anne felt his\nretaliatory scorn. The only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed\nCharlie Sloane, unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly.",

The\nQueen's class listened in breathless suspense for her answer.\n\"Yes, I think I will,\" said Miss Stacy. \"I thought of taking another\nschool, but I have decided to come back to Avonlea. To tell the truth,\nI've grown so interested in my pupils here that I found I couldn't leave\nthem. So I'll stay and see you through.\"\n\"Hurrah!\" said Moody Spurgeon. Moody Spurgeon had never been so carried\naway by his feelings before, and he blushed uncomfortably every time he\nthought about it for a week.\n\"Oh, I'm so glad,\" said Anne, with shining eyes. \"Dear Stacy, it would\nbe perfectly dreadful if you didn't come back. I don't believe I could\nhave the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came\nhere.\"\nWhen Anne got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an\nold trunk in the attic, locked it, and threw the key into the blanket\nbox.\n\"I'm not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation,\" she told\nMarilla. \"I've studied as hard all the term as I possibly could and I've\npored over that geometry until I know every proposition in the first\nbook off by heart, even when the letters _are_ changed. I just feel tired\nof everything sensible and I'm going to let my imagination run riot for\nthe summer. Oh, you needn't be alarmed, Marilla. I'll only let it run\nriot within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly time\nthis summer, for maybe it's the last summer I'll be a little girl. Mrs.\nLynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I've done this\nI'll have to put on longer skirts. She says I'm all running to legs and\neyes.

Oh, yes, he's all right again now,\nbut he takes them spells oftener than he used to and I'm anxious about\nhim. The doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement. That's easy\nenough, for Matthew doesn't go about looking for excitement by any means\nand never did, but he's not to do any very heavy work either and you\nmight as well tell Matthew not to breathe as not to work.

Ruby Gillis's looks are real showy.

I've\nhad a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I'm rejoicing as a\nstrong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesn't Mr.\nAllan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every\nday and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up\nand then we'll be left and have to turn to and break in another green\npreacher. But I don't see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you,\nMarilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we\nhave him. If I were a man I think I'd be a minister. They can have\nsuch an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be\nthrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers' hearts. Why\ncan't women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was\nshocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might\nbe female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank\ngoodness we hadn't got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we\nnever would. But I don't see why. I think women would make splendid\nministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or\nanything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work.\nI'm sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell\nand I've no doubt she could preach too with a little practice.\"\n\"Yes, I believe she could,\" said Marilla dryly. \"She does plenty of\nunofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong\nin Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.\"\n\"Marilla,\" said Anne in a burst of confidence, \"I want to tell you\nsomething and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me\nterribly--on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about\nsuch matters. I do really want to be good; and when I'm with you or Mrs.\nAllan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what\nwould please you and what you would approve of. But mostly when I'm with\nMrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the\nvery thing she tells me I oughtn't to do. I feel irresistibly tempted\nto do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you\nthink it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?\"\nMarilla looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.\n\"If you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very\neffect on me. I sometimes think she'd have more of an influence for\ngood, as you say yourself, if she didn't keep nagging people to do\nright. There should have been a special commandment against nagging.\nBut there, I shouldn't talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she\nmeans well. There isn't a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks\nher share of work.\"\n\"I'm very glad you feel the same,\" said Anne decidedly. \"It's so\nencouraging. I shan't worry so much over that after this. But I dare say\nthere'll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the\ntime--things to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and\nthere's another right after. There are so many things to be thought over\nand decided when you're beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the\ntime thinking them over and deciding what is right. It's a serious thing\nto grow up, isn't it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as\nyou and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up\nsuccessfully, and I'm sure it will be my own fault if I don't. I feel\nit's a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I\ndon't grow up right I can't go back and begin over again. I've grown two\ninches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby's party. I'm\nso glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty\nand it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of course I know it\nwasn't really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie\nPye has flounces on all her dresses. I know I'll be able to study better\nbecause of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my\nmind about that flounce.\"",

      "text": "\"It's worth something to have that,\" admitted Marilla.\nMiss Stacy came back to Avonlea school and found all her pupils eager\nfor work once more. Especially did the Queen's class gird up their loins\nfor the fray, for at the end of the coming year, dimly shadowing their\npathway already, loomed up that fateful thing known as \"the Entrance,\"\nat the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their\nvery shoes. Suppose they did not pass! That thought was doomed to\nhaunt Anne through the waking hours of that winter, Sunday afternoons\ninclusive, to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological\nproblems. When Anne had bad dreams she found herself staring miserably\nat pass lists of the Entrance exams, where Gilbert Blythe's name was\nblazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all.\nBut it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. Schoolwork was\nas interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore. New worlds of\nthought, feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored\nknowledge seemed to be opening out before Anne's eager eyes.\n\"Hills peeped o'er hill and Alps on Alps arose.\"\nMuch of all this was due to Miss Stacy's tactful, careful, broadminded\nguidance. She led her class to think and explore and discover for\nthemselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree\nthat quite shocked Mrs. Lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all\ninnovations on established methods rather dubiously.\nApart from her studies Anne expanded socially, for Marilla, mindful of\nthe Spencervale doctor's dictum, no longer vetoed occasional outings.\nThe Debating Club flourished and gave several concerts; there were one\nor two parties almost verging on grown-up affairs; there were sleigh\ndrives and skating frolics galore.\nBetween times Anne grew, shooting up so rapidly that Marilla was\nastonished one day, when they were standing side by side, to find the\ngirl was taller than herself.\n\"Why, Anne, how you've grown!\" she said, almost unbelievingly. A sigh\nfollowed on the words. Marilla felt a queer regret over Anne's inches.\nThe child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this\ntall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and the\nproudly poised little head, in her place. Marilla loved the girl as much\nas she had loved the child, but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful\nsense of loss. And that night, when Anne had gone to prayer meeting\nwith Diana, Marilla sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the\nweakness of a cry. Matthew, coming in with a lantern, caught her at it\nand gazed at her in such consternation that Marilla had to laugh through\nher tears.\n\"I was thinking about Anne,\" she explained. \"She's got to be such a big\ngirl--and she'll probably be away from us next winter. I'll miss her\nterrible.\"\n\"She'll be able to come home often,\" comforted Matthew, to whom Anne was\nas yet and always would be the little, eager girl he had brought home\nfrom Bright River on that June evening four years before. \"The branch\nrailroad will be built to Carmody by that time.\"\n\"It won't be the same thing as having her here all the time,\" sighed\nMarilla gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted.\n\"But there--men can't understand these things!\"",

      "text": "\"Dearest Diana\" [wrote Anne],\n\"Here it is Tuesday night and I'm writing this in the library at\nBeechwood. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and\nwished so much you were with me. I couldn't 'cram' because I'd promised\nMiss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history\nas it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were\nlearned.\n\"This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling\nfor Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands\nand they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn't slept\na wink and she didn't believe I was strong enough to stand the grind\nof the teacher's course even if I did get through. There are times and\nseasons even yet when I don't feel that I've made any great headway in\nlearning to like Josie Pye!\n\"When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from\nall over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting\non the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth\nhe was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over\nand over to steady his nerves and for pity's sake not to interrupt\nhim, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot\neverything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts\nfirmly in their proper place!\n\"When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and\nI sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of\nthe multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if\nI looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear\nacross the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English\nexamination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled\naround as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly\nas I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green\nGables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began\nbeating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I\nknew I could do something with _that_ paper anyhow.\n\"At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in\nthe afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully\nmixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh,\nDiana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it\nit takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my\nEuclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would\nrecite it from now till tomorrow morning.\n\"I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody\nSpurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in\nhistory and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he\nwas going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a\ncarpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to\nstay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn't.\nSometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon\nI'm always glad I'm a girl and not his sister.\n\"Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just\ndiscovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When\nshe recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had\nbeen with us.\n\"Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as\nMrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I\nfail in geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I\nthink I'd rather it didn't go on if I failed!\n\"Yours devotedly,\n\"Anne\"",

      "text": "The geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and\nAnne arrived home on Friday evening, rather tired but with an air of\nchastened triumph about her. Diana was over at Green Gables when she\narrived and they met as if they had been parted for years.\n\"You old darling, it's perfectly splendid to see you back again. It\nseems like an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, how did you get\nalong?\"\n\"Pretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry. I don't know\nwhether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment\nthat I didn't. Oh, how good it is to be back! Green Gables is the\ndearest, loveliest spot in the world.\"\n\"How did the others do?\"\n\"The girls say they know they didn't pass, but I think they did pretty\nwell. Josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it!\nMoody Spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and Charlie says he\nfailed in algebra. But we don't really know anything about it and won't\nuntil the pass list is out. That won't be for a fortnight. Fancy living\na fortnight in such suspense! I wish I could go to sleep and never wake\nup until it is over.\"\nDiana knew it would be useless to ask how Gilbert Blythe had fared, so\nshe merely said:\n\"Oh, you'll pass all right. Don't worry.\"\n\"I'd rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the\nlist,\" flashed Anne, by which she meant--and Diana knew she meant--that\nsuccess would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of\nGilbert Blythe.\nWith this end in view Anne had strained every nerve during the\nexaminations. So had Gilbert. They had met and passed each other on the\nstreet a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time Anne\nhad held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly\nthat she had made friends with Gilbert when he asked her, and vowed a\nlittle more determinedly to surpass him in the examination. She knew\nthat all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she\neven knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question\nand that Josie Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that Gilbert\nwould be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if\nshe failed.\nBut she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. She wanted\nto \"pass high\" for the sake of Matthew and Marilla--especially Matthew.\nMatthew had declared to her his conviction that she \"would beat the\nwhole Island.\" That, Anne felt, was something it would be foolish to\nhope for even in the wildest dreams. But she did hope fervently that she\nwould be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew's\nkindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement. That, she\nfelt, would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient\ngrubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations.\nAt the end of the fortnight Anne took to \"haunting\" the post office\nalso, in the distracted company of Jane, Ruby, and Josie, opening the\nCharlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings\nas bad as any experienced during the Entrance week. Charlie and Gilbert\nwere not above doing this too, but Moody Spurgeon stayed resolutely\naway.\n\"I haven't got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,\"\nhe told Anne. \"I'm just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me\nsuddenly whether I've passed or not.\"\nWhen three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Anne began\nto feel that she really couldn't stand the strain much longer. Her\nappetite failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished.\nMrs. Lynde wanted to know what else you could expect with a Tory\nsuperintendent of education at the head of affairs, and Matthew, noting\nAnne's paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her\nhome from the post office every afternoon, began seriously to wonder if\nhe hadn't better vote Grit at the next election.\nBut one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her open window,\nfor the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the\nworld, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with\nflower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the\nstir of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink\nfrom the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the\nspirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying\ndown through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a\nfluttering newspaper in her hand.\nAnne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The\npass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt\nher. She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Diana\ncame rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even\nknocking, so great was her excitement.\n\"Anne, you've passed,\" she cried, \"passed the _very first_--you and\nGilbert both--you're ties--but your name is first. Oh, I'm so proud!\"\nDiana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne's bed, utterly\nbreathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp,\noversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her\nshaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper.\nYes, she had passed--there was her name at the very top of a list of two\nhundred! That moment was worth living for.\n\"You did just splendidly, Anne,\" puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently\nto sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a\nword. \"Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes\nago--it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won't be here\ntill tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over\nlike a wild thing. You've all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon\nand all, although he's conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty\nwell--they're halfway up--and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through\nwith three marks to spare, but you'll see she'll put on as many airs as\nif she'd led. Won't Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel\nlike to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were\nme I know I'd go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but\nyou're as calm and cool as a spring evening.\"\n\"I'm just dazzled inside,\" said Anne. \"I want to say a hundred things,\nand I can't find words to say them in. I never dreamed of this--yes, I\ndid too, just once! I let myself think _once_, 'What if I should come out\nfirst?' quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to\nthink I could lead the Island. Excuse me a minute, Diana. I must run\nright out to the field to tell Matthew. Then we'll go up the road and\ntell the good news to the others.\"\nThey hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling\nhay, and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at\nthe lane fence.\n\"Oh, Matthew,\" exclaimed Anne, \"I've passed and I'm first--or one of the\nfirst! I'm not vain, but I'm thankful.\"\n\"Well now, I always said it,\" said Matthew, gazing at the pass list\ndelightedly. \"I knew you could beat them all easy.\"\n\"You've done pretty well, I must say, Anne,\" said Marilla, trying to\nhide her extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel's critical eye. But that\ngood soul said heartily:\n\"I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in\nsaying it. You're a credit to your friends, Anne, that's what, and we're\nall proud of you.\"\nThat night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious\nlittle talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open\nwindow in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude\nand aspiration that came straight from her heart. There was in it\nthankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when\nshe slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and\nbeautiful as maidenhood might desire.",

      "text": "PUT on your white organdy, by all means, Anne,\" advised Diana\ndecidedly.\nThey were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only\ntwilight--a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless\nsky. A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into\nburnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet\nsummer sounds--sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway\nvoices and laughter. But in Anne's room the blind was drawn and the lamp\nlighted, for an important toilet was being made.\nThe east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that\nnight four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to\nthe marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept\nin, Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and\ndainty a nest as a young girl could desire.\nThe velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of\nAnne's early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams\nhad kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented\nthem. The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that\nsoftened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of\npale-green art muslin. The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade\ntapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few\ngood pictures given Anne by Mrs. Allan. Miss Stacy's photograph occupied\nthe place of honor, and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh\nflowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly\nperfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance. There was no \"mahogany\nfurniture,\" but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a\ncushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin,\na quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes\npainted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a\nlow white bed.\nAnne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had\ngot it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all\nthe available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it\nalong. Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir\nhad been asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a\nviolin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad;\nand Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to\nrecite.\nAs Anne would have said at one time, it was \"an epoch in her life,\" and\nshe was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in\nthe seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his\nAnne and Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather\nthan admit it, and said she didn't think it was very proper for a lot\nof young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible\nperson with them.\nAnne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother\nBilly in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and\nboys were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from\ntown, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.\n\"Do you really think the organdy will be best?\" queried Anne anxiously.\n\"I don't think it's as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it\ncertainly isn't so fashionable.\"\n\"But it suits you ever so much better,\" said Diana. \"It's so soft\nand frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too\ndressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.\"\nAnne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for\nnotable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much\nsought after. She was looking very pretty herself on this particular\nnight in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was\nforever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so\nher appearance was of minor importance. All her pains were bestowed upon\nAnne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and\ncombed and adorned to the Queen's taste.\n\"Pull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now\nfor your slippers. I'm going to braid your hair in two thick braids,\nand tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, don't pull out a single\ncurl over your forehead--just have the soft part. There is no way you do\nyour hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a\nMadonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose\njust behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for\nyou.\"\n\"Shall I put my pearl beads on?\" asked Anne. \"Matthew brought me a\nstring from town last week, and I know he'd like to see them on me.\"\nDiana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically,\nand finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied\naround Anne's slim milk-white throat.\n\"There's something so stylish about you, Anne,\" said Diana, with\nunenvious admiration. \"You hold your head with such an air. I suppose\nit's your figure. I am just a dumpling. I've always been afraid of it,\nand now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign\nmyself to it.\"\n\"But you have such dimples,\" said Anne, smiling affectionately into the\npretty, vivacious face so near her own. \"Lovely dimples, like little\ndents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream\nwill never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn't\ncomplain. Am I all ready now?\"\n\"All ready,\" assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt\nfigure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a\nmuch softer face. \"Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla.\nDoesn't she look lovely?\"\nMarilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.\n\"She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I\nexpect she'll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew\nwith it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy's the\nmost unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when\nhe got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays.\nTime was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for\nAnne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything\noff on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable,\nand Matthew plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear\nof the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.\"",

      "text": "At this unpropitious moment her name was called. Somehow Anne--who did\nnot notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace\ngirl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied\ntherein if she had--got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front.\nShe was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each\nother's hands in nervous sympathy.\nAnne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as\nshe had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience\nas this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely.\nEverything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of\nladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of\nwealth and culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches\nat the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of\nfriends and neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless\ncritics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement\nfrom her \"rustic\" efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and\nmiserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness\ncame over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would\nhave fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt,\nmust ever after be her portion if she did so.\nBut suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the\naudience, she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending\nforward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once\ntriumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert\nwas merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and\nof the effect produced by Anne's slender white form and spiritual face\nagainst a background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had\ndriven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant\nand taunting. But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if\nshe had. She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage\nand determination tingling over her like an electric shock. She _would\nnot_ fail before Gilbert Blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her,\nnever, never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her\nrecitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of\nthe room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored\nto her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness\nshe recited as she had never done before. When she finished there were\nbursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing\nwith shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken\nby the stout lady in pink silk.\n\"My dear, you did splendidly,\" she puffed. \"I've been crying like a\nbaby, actually I have. There, they're encoring you--they're bound to\nhave you back!\"\n\"Oh, I can't go,\" said Anne confusedly. \"But yet--I must, or Matthew\nwill be disappointed. He said they would encore me.\"\n\"Then don't disappoint Matthew,\" said the pink lady, laughing.\nSmiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint,\nfunny little selection that captivated her audience still further. The\nrest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.",

      "text": "When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady--who was the wife of\nan American millionaire--took her under her wing, and introduced her\nto everybody; and everybody was very nice to her. The professional\nelocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that\nshe had a charming voice and \"interpreted\" her selections beautifully.\nEven the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had\nsupper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane\nwere invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne,\nbut Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear\nof some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team,\nhowever, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into\nthe calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked\ninto the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.\nOh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night!\nHow great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the\nsea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants\nguarding enchanted coasts.\n\"Hasn't it been a perfectly splendid time?\" sighed Jane, as they drove\naway. \"I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at\na hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and\nchicken salad every blessed day. I'm sure it would be ever so much\nmore fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great,\nalthough I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it\nwas better than Mrs. Evans's.\"\n\"Oh, no, don't say things like that, Jane,\" said Anne quickly, \"because\nit sounds silly. It couldn't be better than Mrs. Evans's, you know, for\nshe is a professional, and I'm only a schoolgirl, with a little knack\nof reciting. I'm quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty\nwell.\"\n\"I've a compliment for you, Anne,\" said Diana. \"At least I think it\nmust be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it\nwas anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a\nromantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he\nis a distinguished artist, and that her mother's cousin in Boston is\nmarried to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard\nhim say--didn't we, Jane?--'Who is that girl on the platform with the\nsplendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.' There now,\nAnne. But what does Titian hair mean?\"\n\"Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,\" laughed Anne. \"Titian\nwas a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.\"\n\"_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?\" sighed Jane. \"They\nwere simply dazzling. Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?\"\n\"We _are_ rich,\" said Anne staunchly. \"Why, we have sixteen years to our\ncredit, and we're happy as queens, and we've all got imaginations, more\nor less. Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of\nthings not seen. We couldn't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had\nmillions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldn't change into any\nof those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl\nand wear a sour look all your life, as if you'd been born turning up\nyour nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so\nstout and short that you'd really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans,\nwith that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully\nunhappy sometime to have such a look. You _know_ you wouldn't, Jane\nAndrews!\"\n\"I _don't_ know--exactly,\" said Jane unconvinced. \"I think diamonds would\ncomfort a person for a good deal.\"\n\"Well, I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by\ndiamonds all my life,\" declared Anne. \"I'm quite content to be Anne of\nGreen Gables, with my string of pearl beads. I know Matthew gave me as\nmuch love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady's jewels.\"",

      "text": "THE next three weeks were busy ones at Green Gables, for Anne was\ngetting ready to go to Queen's, and there was much sewing to be done,\nand many things to be talked over and arranged. Anne's outfit was\nample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made\nno objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested. More--one\nevening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate\npale green material.\n\"Anne, here's something for a nice light dress for you. I don't suppose\nyou really need it; you've plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe\nyou'd like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere\nof an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that\nJane and Ruby and Josie have got 'evening dresses,' as they call them,\nand I don't mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me\npick it in town last week, and we'll get Emily Gillis to make it for\nyou. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren't to be equaled.\"\n\"Oh, Marilla, it's just lovely,\" said Anne. \"Thank you so much. I don't\nbelieve you ought to be so kind to me--it's making it harder every day\nfor me to go away.\"\nThe green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings\nas Emily's taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew's\nand Marilla's benefit, and recited \"The Maiden's Vow\" for them in the\nkitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful\nmotions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green\nGables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child\nin her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking\nout of her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to\nMarilla's own eyes.\n\"I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,\" said Anne gaily\nstooping over Marilla's chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady's\ncheek. \"Now, I call that a positive triumph.\"\n\"No, I wasn't crying over your piece,\" said Marilla, who would have\nscorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. \"I just\ncouldn't help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. And\nI was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your\nqueer ways. You've grown up now and you're going away; and you look so\ntall and stylish and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if\nyou didn't belong in Avonlea at all--and I just got lonesome thinking it\nall over.\"\n\"Marilla!\" Anne sat down on Marilla's gingham lap, took Marilla's lined\nface between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla's\neyes. \"I'm not a bit changed--not really. I'm only just pruned down and\nbranched out. The real _me_--back here--is just the same. It won't make a\nbit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I\nshall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear\nGreen Gables more and better every day of her life.\"\nAnne laid her fresh young cheek against Marilla's faded one, and reached\nout a hand to pat Matthew's shoulder. Marilla would have given much just\nthen to have possessed Anne's power of putting her feelings into words;\nbut nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her\narms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing\nthat she need never let her go.\nMatthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went\nout-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked\nagitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.\n\"Well now, I guess she ain't been much spoiled,\" he muttered, proudly.\n\"I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all.\nShe's smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the\nrest. She's been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake\nthan what Mrs. Spencer made--if it _was_ luck. I don't believe it was any\nsuch thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her, I\nreckon.\"",

Anne\nintended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss\nStacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same.

Jane, Ruby,\nJosie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the\nstirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work.\nAnne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in\na room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the\ntall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion\nshe did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically.\nYet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old\nrivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what\nto do if it had been lacking.\n\"I wouldn't feel comfortable without it,\" she thought. \"Gilbert looks\nawfully determined.

She was not to board with the other girls, who\nall had relatives in town to take pity on them. Miss Josephine Barry\nwould have liked to board her, but Beechwood was so far from the\nAcademy that it was out of the question; so Miss Barry hunted up a\nboarding-house, assuring Matthew and Marilla that it was the very place\nfor Anne.\n\"The lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman,\" explained Miss Barry.\n\"Her husband was a British officer, and she is very careful what sort\nof boarders she takes. Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons\nunder her roof. The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in\na quiet neighborhood.\"\nAll this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did\nnot materially help Anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized\nupon her. She looked dismally about her narrow little room, with its\ndull-papered, pictureless walls, its small iron bedstead and empty\nbook-case; and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of\nher own white room at Green Gables, where she would have the pleasant\nconsciousness of a great green still outdoors, of sweet peas growing in\nthe garden, and moonlight falling on the orchard, of the brook below the\nslope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it, of a\nvast starry sky, and the light from Diana's window shining out through\nthe gap in the trees. Here there was nothing of this; Anne knew that\noutside of her window was a hard street, with a network of telephone\nwires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand\nlights gleaming on stranger faces. She knew that she was going to cry,\nand fought against it.\n\"I _won't_ cry. It's silly--and weak--there's the third tear splashing\ndown by my nose. There are more coming! I must think of something funny\nto stop them. But there's nothing funny except what is connected with\nAvonlea, and that only makes things worse--four--five--I'm going home\nnext Friday, but that seems a hundred years away. Oh, Matthew is nearly\nhome by now--and Marilla is at the gate, looking down the lane for\nhim--six--seven--eight--oh, there's no use in counting them! They're\ncoming in a flood presently. I can't cheer up--I don't _want_ to cheer up.\nIt's nicer to be miserable!\"\nThe flood of tears would have come, no doubt, had not Josie Pye appeared\nat that moment. In the joy of seeing a familiar face Anne forgot that\nthere had never been much love lost between her and Josie. As a part of\nAvonlea life even a Pye was welcome.\n\"I'm so glad you came up,\" Anne said sincerely.\n\"You've been crying,\" remarked Josie, with aggravating pity. \"I suppose\nyou're homesick--some people have so little self-control in that\nrespect. I've no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town's too\njolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so\nlong. You shouldn't cry, Anne; it isn't becoming, for your nose and eyes\nget red, and then you seem _all_ red. I'd a perfectly scrumptious time in\nthe Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache\nwould give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable\naround, Anne? I'm literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla 'd\nload you up with cake. That's why I called round. Otherwise I'd have\ngone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards\nsame place as I do, and he's a sport. He noticed you in class today, and\nasked me who the red-headed girl was. I told him you were an orphan that\nthe Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you'd\nbeen before that.\"\nAnne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more\nsatisfactory than Josie Pye's companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared,\neach with an inch of Queen's color ribbon--purple and scarlet--pinned\nproudly to her coat. As Josie was not \"speaking\" to Jane just then she",

It has the real\nAvonlea flavor.\"\nRuby, perceiving the Queen's calendar lying on the table, wanted to know\nif Anne meant to try for the gold medal.\nAnne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it.\n\"Oh, that reminds me,\" said Josie, \"Queen's is to get one of the Avery\nscholarships after all. The word came today. Frank Stockley told me--his\nuncle is one of the board of governors, you know. It will be announced\nin the Academy tomorrow.\"\nAn Avery scholarship! Anne felt her heart beat more quickly, and the\nhorizons of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic. Before\nJosie had told the news Anne's highest pinnacle of aspiration had been\na teacher's provincial license, First Class, at the end of the year, and\nperhaps the medal! But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning\nthe Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and\ngraduating in a gown and mortar board, before the echo of Josie's words\nhad died away. For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt\nthat here her foot was on native heath.\nA wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his\nfortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed\namong the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces,\naccording to their respective standings. There had been much doubt\nwhether one would be allotted to Queen's, but the matter was settled at\nlast, and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark\nin English and English Literature would win the scholarship--two hundred\nand fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College. No wonder\nthat Anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks!\n\"I'll win that scholarship if hard work can do it,\" she resolved.\n\"Wouldn't Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh, it's delightful to\nhave ambitions. I'm so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to\nbe any end to them--that's the best of it. Just as soon as you attain\nto one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still. It does\nmake life so interesting.\"",

She had large, bright-blue eyes,\na brilliant complexion, and a plump showy figure. She laughed a great\ndeal, was cheerful and good-tempered, and enjoyed the pleasant things of\nlife frankly.\n\"But I shouldn't think she was the sort of girl Gilbert would like,\"\nwhispered Jane to Anne. Anne did not think so either, but she would not\nhave said so for the Avery scholarship. She could not help thinking,\ntoo, that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as Gilbert\nto jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and\nambitions. Gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem\nthe sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed.\nThere was no silly sentiment in Anne's ideas concerning Gilbert. Boys\nwere to her, when she thought about them at all, merely possible good\ncomrades. If she and Gilbert had been friends she would not have cared\nhow many other friends he had nor with whom he walked. She had a genius\nfor friendship; girl friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague\nconsciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing\nto round out one's conceptions of companionship and furnish broader\nstandpoints of judgment and comparison. Not that Anne could have put her\nfeelings on the matter into just such clear definition. But she thought\nthat if Gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train, over the\ncrisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and\nmerry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening\naround them and their hopes and ambitions therein.

For\nwe pay a price for everything we get or take in this world; and although\nambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply won, but\nexact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement.\nAnne was pale and quiet; in ten more minutes she would know who had\nwon the medal and who the Avery. Beyond those ten minutes there did not\nseem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time.\n\"Of course you'll win one of them anyhow,\" said Jane, who couldn't\nunderstand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise.\n\"I have not hope of the Avery,\" said Anne. \"Everybody says Emily Clay\nwill win it. And I'm not going to march up to that bulletin board and\nlook at it before everybody. I haven't the moral courage. I'm going\nstraight to the girls' dressing room. You must read the announcements\nand then come and tell me, Jane. And I implore you in the name of our\nold friendship to do it as quickly as possible. If I have failed just\nsay so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do _don't_\nsympathize with me. Promise me this, Jane.\"\nJane promised solemnly; but, as it happened, there was no necessity for\nsuch a promise. When they went up the entrance steps of Queen's they\nfound the hall full of boys who were carrying Gilbert Blythe around on\ntheir shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voices, \"Hurrah for\nBlythe, Medalist!\"\nFor a moment Anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment.",

Surely he was much grayer than he had been a year\nbefore.\n\"Marilla,\" she said hesitatingly when he had gone out, \"is Matthew quite\nwell?\"\n\"No, he isn't,\" said Marilla in a troubled tone. \"He's had some real\nbad spells with his heart this spring and he won't spare himself a mite.\nI've been real worried about him, but he's some better this while back\nand we've got a good hired man, so I'm hoping he'll kind of rest and\npick up. Maybe he will now you're home. You always cheer him up.\"\nAnne leaned across the table and took Marilla's face in her hands.\n\"You are not looking as well yourself as I'd like to see you, Marilla.\nYou look tired. I'm afraid you've been working too hard. You must take\na rest, now that I'm home. I'm just going to take this one day off to\nvisit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and then it will\nbe your turn to be lazy while I do the work.\"\nMarilla smiled affectionately at her girl.\n\"It's not the work--it's my head. I've got a pain so often now--behind\nmy eyes. Doctor Spencer's been fussing with glasses, but they don't do\nme any good. There is a distinguished oculist coming to the Island the\nlast of June and the doctor says I must see him. I guess I'll have to.\nI can't read or sew with any comfort now. Well, Anne, you've done real\nwell at Queen's I must say. To take First Class License in one year and\nwin the Avery scholarship--well, well, Mrs. Lynde says pride goes before\na fall and she doesn't believe in the higher education of women at all;\nshe says it unfits them for woman's true sphere. I don't believe a word\nof it. Speaking of Rachel reminds me--did you hear anything about the\nAbbey Bank lately, Anne?\"\n\"I heard it was shaky,\" answered Anne. \"Why?\"\n\"That is what Rachel said. She was up here one day last week and said\nthere was some talk about it. Matthew felt real worried. All we have\nsaved is in that bank--every penny. I wanted Matthew to put it in the\nSavings Bank in the first place, but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of\nfather's and he'd always banked with him. Matthew said any bank with him\nat the head of it was good enough for anybody.\"\n\"I think he has only been its nominal head for many years,\" said\nAnne. \"He is a very old man; his nephews are really at the head of the\ninstitution.\"\n\"Well, when Rachel told us that, I wanted Matthew to draw our money\nright out and he said he'd think of it. But Mr. Russell told him",

She\nnever forgot that day; it was so bright and golden and fair, so free\nfrom shadow and so lavish of blossom. Anne spent some of its rich hours\nin the orchard; she went to the Dryad's Bubble and Willowmere and Violet\nVale; she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with Mrs. Allan;\nand finally in the evening she went with Matthew for the cows, through\nLovers' Lane to the back pasture. The woods were all gloried through\nwith sunset and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill\ngaps in the west. Matthew walked slowly with bent head; Anne, tall and\nerect, suited her springing step to his.\n\"You've been working too hard today, Matthew,\" she said reproachfully.\n\"Why won't you take things easier?\"\n\"Well now, I can't seem to,\" said Matthew, as he opened the yard gate\nto let the cows through. \"It's only that I'm getting old, Anne, and keep\nforgetting it. Well, well, I've always worked pretty hard and I'd rather\ndrop in harness.\"\n\"If I had been the boy you sent for,\" said Anne wistfully, \"I'd be able\nto help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways. I could find it\nin my heart to wish I had been, just for that.\"\n\"Well now, I'd rather have you than a dozen boys, Anne,\" said Matthew\npatting her hand. \"Just mind you that--rather than a dozen boys. Well\nnow, I guess it wasn't a boy that took the Avery scholarship, was it? It\nwas a girl--my girl--my girl that I'm proud of.\"\nHe smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard. Anne took the\nmemory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a\nlong while at her open window, thinking of the past and dreaming of the\nfuture. Outside the Snow Queen was mistily white in the moonshine;\nthe frogs were singing in the marsh beyond Orchard Slope.

      "text": "hushed and tranquil. In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin,\nhis long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little\nkindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams. There were\nflowers about him--sweet old-fashioned flowers which his mother had\nplanted in the homestead garden in her bridal days and for which Matthew\nhad always had a secret, wordless love. Anne had gathered them and\nbrought them to him, her anguished, tearless eyes burning in her white\nface. It was the last thing she could do for him.\nThe Barrys and Mrs. Lynde stayed with them that night. Diana, going to\nthe east gable, where Anne was standing at her window, said gently:\n\"Anne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?\"\n\"Thank you, Diana.\" Anne looked earnestly into her friend's face. \"I\nthink you won't misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone. I'm not\nafraid. I haven't been alone one minute since it happened--and I want to\nbe. I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it. I can't\nrealize it. Half the time it seems to me that Matthew can't be dead; and\nthe other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and\nI've had this horrible dull ache ever since.\"\nDiana did not quite understand. Marilla's impassioned grief, breaking\nall the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush,\nshe could comprehend better than Anne's tearless agony. But she went\naway kindly, leaving Anne alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow.\nAnne hoped that the tears would come in solitude. It seemed to her a\nterrible thing that she could not shed a tear for Matthew, whom she had\nloved so much and who had been so kind to her, Matthew who had walked\nwith her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below\nwith that awful peace on his brow. But no tears came at first, even when\nshe knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed, looking up to the\nstars beyond the hills--no tears, only the same horrible dull ache of\nmisery that kept on aching until she fell asleep, worn out with the\nday's pain and excitement.\nIn the night she awakened, with the stillness and the darkness about\nher, and the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of\nsorrow. She could see Matthew's face smiling at her as he had smiled\nwhen they parted at the gate that last evening--she could hear his voice\nsaying, \"My girl--my girl that I'm proud of.\" Then the tears came and\nAnne wept her heart out. Marilla heard her and crept in to comfort her.\n\"There--there--don't cry so, dearie. It can't bring him back.\nIt--it--isn't right to cry so. I knew that today, but I couldn't help\nit then. He'd always been such a good, kind brother to me--but God knows\nbest.\"\n\"Oh, just let me cry, Marilla,\" sobbed Anne. \"The tears don't hurt me\nlike that ache did. Stay here for a little while with me and keep your\narm round me--so. I couldn't have Diana stay, she's good and kind and\nsweet--but it's not her sorrow--she's outside of it and she couldn't\ncome close enough to my heart to help me. It's our sorrow--yours and\nmine. Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him?\"\n\"We've got each other, Anne. I don't know what I'd do if you weren't\nhere--if you'd never come. Oh, Anne, I know I've been kind of strict and\nharsh with you maybe--but you mustn't think I didn't love you as well as\nMatthew did, for all that. I want to tell you now when I can. It's never\nbeen easy for me to say things out of my heart, but at times like this\nit's easier. I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood\nand you've been my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables.\"\nTwo days afterwards they carried Matthew Cuthbert over his homestead\nthreshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had\nloved and the trees he had planted; and then Avonlea settled back to its\nusual placidity and even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old\ngroove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before,\nalthough always with the aching sense of \"loss in all familiar things.\"",

She\nhad never seen Marilla sit limply inert like that.\n\"Are you very tired, Marilla?\"\n\"Yes--no--I don't know,\" said Marilla wearily, looking up. \"I suppose I\nam tired but I haven't thought about it. It's not that.\"\n\"Did you see the oculist? What did he say?\" asked Anne anxiously.\n\"Yes, I saw him. He examined my eyes. He says that if I give up all\nreading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes,\nand if I'm careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he's given me\nhe thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured.\nBut if I don't he says I'll certainly be stone-blind in six months.\nBlind! Anne, just think of it!\"\nFor a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was\nsilent. It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak. Then she said\nbravely, but with a catch in her voice:\n\"Marilla, _don't_ think of it. You know he has given you hope. If you are\ncareful you won't lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure\nyour headaches it will be a great thing.\"\n\"I don't call it much hope,\" said Marilla bitterly. \"What am I to live\nfor if I can't read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well\nbe blind--or dead. And as for crying, I can't help that when I get\nlonesome. But there, it's no good talking about it. If you'll get me\na cup of tea I'll be thankful. I'm about done out. Don't say anything\nabout this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can't bear that folks\nshould come here to question and sympathize and talk about it.\"\nWhen Marilla had eaten her lunch Anne persuaded her to go to bed. Then\nAnne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the\ndarkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart. How sadly\nthings had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home!\nThen she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy\nwith promise.

I'm sorry you won't have a home to come to in your\nvacations, that's all, but I suppose you'll manage somehow.\"\nMarilla broke down and wept bitterly.\n\"You mustn't sell Green Gables,\" said Anne resolutely.\n\"Oh, Anne, I wish I didn't have to.

      "text": "When it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up\nthe idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there\nwas a good deal of discussion over it. Most of the good folks, not\nknowing about Marilla's eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did\nnot. She told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure\nto the girl's eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening\nand found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,\nscented summer dusk. They liked to sit there when the twilight came down\nand the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled\nthe dewy air.\nMrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the\ndoor, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a\nlong breath of mingled weariness and relief.\n\"I declare I'm getting glad to sit down. I've been on my feet all day,\nand two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It's\na great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well,\nAnne, I hear you've given up your notion of going to college. I was\nreal glad to hear it. You've got as much education now as a woman can be\ncomfortable with. I don't believe in girls going to college with the men\nand cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.\"\n\"But I'm going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde,\" said\nAnne laughing. \"I'm going to take my Arts course right here at Green\nGables, and study everything that I would at college.\"\nMrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.\n\"Anne Shirley, you'll kill yourself.\"\n\"Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I'm not going to overdo\nthings. As 'Josiah Allen's wife,' says, I shall be 'mejum'. But I'll\nhave lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I've no\nvocation for fancy work. I'm going to teach over at Carmody, you know.\"\n\"I don't know it. I guess you're going to teach right here in Avonlea.\nThe trustees have decided to give you the school.\"\n\"Mrs. Lynde!\" cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. \"Why, I\nthought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!\"\n\"So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it\nhe went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night,\nyou know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested\nthat they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of\ncourse he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must\nsay I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real\nself-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands,\nand everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the\ntrustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came\nhome and told me.\"\n\"I don't feel that I ought to take it,\" murmured Anne. \"I mean--I don't\nthink I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me.\"\n\"I guess you can't prevent him now. He's signed papers with the White\nSands trustees. So it wouldn't do him any good now if you were to\nrefuse. Of course you'll take the school. You'll get along all right,\nnow that there are no Pyes going. Josie was the last of them, and a\ngood thing she was, that's what. There's been some Pye or other going to\nAvonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in\nlife was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn't their home.\nBless my heart! What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry\ngable mean?\"\n\"Diana is signaling for me to go over,\" laughed Anne. \"You know we keep\nup the old custom. Excuse me while I run over and see what she wants.\"\nAnne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry\nshadows of the Haunted Wood. Mrs. Lynde looked after her indulgently.\n\"There's a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways.\"\n\"There's a good deal more of the woman about her in others,\" retorted",

As\nMrs. Lynde told her Thomas that night.\n\"Marilla Cuthbert has got _mellow_. That's what.\"\nAnne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh\nflowers on Matthew's grave and water the Scotch rosebush. She lingered\nthere until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place,\nwith its poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its\nwhispering grasses growing at will among the graves. When she finally\nleft it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining\nWaters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike\nafterlight--\"a haunt of ancient peace.\" There was a freshness in the\nair as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover. Home\nlights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees. Beyond lay\nthe sea, misty and purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur. The west\nwas a glory of soft mingled hues, and the pond reflected them all in\nstill softer shadings. The beauty of it all thrilled Anne's heart, and\nshe gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it.\n\"Dear old world,\" she murmured, \"you are very lovely, and I am glad to\nbe alive in you.\"\nHalfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the\nBlythe homestead. It was Gilbert, and the whistle died on his lips as he\nrecognized Anne. He lifted his cap courteously, but he would have passed\non in silence, if Anne had not stopped and held out her hand.\n\"Gilbert,\" she said, with scarlet cheeks, \"I want to thank you for\ngiving up the school for me. It was very good of you--and I want you to\nknow that I appreciate it.\"\nGilbert took the offered hand eagerly.\n\"It wasn't particularly good of me at all, Anne. I was pleased to be\nable to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after\nthis? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?\"\nAnne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.\n\"I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn't know\nit. What a stubborn little goose I was. I've been--I may as well make a\ncomplete confession--I've been sorry ever since.\"\n\"We are going to be the best of friends,\" said Gilbert, jubilantly. \"We\nwere born to be good friends, Anne. You've thwarted destiny enough. I\nknow we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your\nstudies, aren't you? So am I. Come, I'm going to walk home with you.\"\nMarilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.\n\"Who was that came up the lane with you, Anne?\"\n\"Gilbert Blythe,\" answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing. \"I met\nhim on Barry's hill.\"\n\"I didn't think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you'd\nstand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,\" said Marilla with a\ndry smile.\n\"We haven't been--we've been good enemies. But we have decided that it\nwill be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. Were we\nreally there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see,\nwe have five years' lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla.\"\nAnne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content.\nThe wind purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came\nup to her. The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and\nDiana's light gleamed through the old gap.\nAnne's horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after\ncoming home from Queen's; but if the path set before her feet was to be\nnarrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it.\nThe joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship\nwere to be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her\nideal world of dreams. And there was always the bend in the road!",
