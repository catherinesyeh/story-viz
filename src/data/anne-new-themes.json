            "text": "MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down\ninto a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and\ntraversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the\nold Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook\nin its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool\nand cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde's Hollow it was a quiet,\nwell-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs.\nRachel Lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum; it\nprobably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window,\nkeeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children\nup, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never\nrest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.\nThere are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend\nclosely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own;\nbut Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage\ntheir own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a\nnotable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she \"ran\" the\nSewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop\nof the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all\nthis Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen\nwindow, knitting \"cotton warp\" quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them,\nas Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping\na sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up\nthe steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular\npeninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two\nsides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that\nhill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel's all-seeing\neye.\nShe was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in\nat the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house\nwas in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of\nbees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called \"Rachel\nLynde's husband\"--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field\nbeyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on\nthe big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew\nthat he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening\nbefore in William J. Blair's store over at Carmody that he meant to sow\nhis turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for\nMatthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about\nanything in his whole life.\nAnd yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon\nof a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill;\nmoreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was\nplain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy\nand the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable\ndistance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going\nthere?\nHad it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this\nand that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both\nquestions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be\nsomething pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest\nman alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where\nhe might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and\ndriving in a buggy, was something that didn't happen often. Mrs. Rachel,\nponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoon's\nenjoyment was spoiled.\n\"I'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla\nwhere he's gone and why,\" the worthy woman finally concluded. \"He\ndoesn't generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if\nhe'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to\ngo for more; he wasn't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor.\nYet something must have happened since last night to start him off. I'm\nclean puzzled, that's what, and I won't know a minute's peace of mind or\nconscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea\ntoday.\"",

            "text": "Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the\nbig, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a\nscant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde's Hollow. To be sure, the\nlong lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert's father, as\nshy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly\ncould from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods\nwhen he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest\nedge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible\nfrom the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so\nsociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place\n_living_ at all.\n\"It's just _staying_, that's what,\" she said as she stepped along the\ndeep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. \"It's no wonder\nMatthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by\nthemselves. Trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were\nthere'd be enough of them. I'd ruther look at people. To be sure, they\nseem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they're used to it. A body\ncan get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.\"\nWith this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green\nGables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one\nside with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies.\nNot a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have\nseen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla\nCuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could\nhave eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial\npeck of dirt.\nMrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in\nwhen bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful\napartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully\nclean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its\nwindows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on\nthe back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one,\nwhence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left\norchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook,\nwas greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when\nshe sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to\nher too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to\nbe taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind\nher was laid for supper.\nMrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental\nnote of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid,\nso that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but\nthe dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves\nand one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any\nparticular company. Yet what of Matthew's white collar and the sorrel\nmare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery\nabout quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.",

            "text": "\"Good evening, Rachel,\" Marilla said briskly. \"This is a real fine\nevening, isn't it? Won't you sit down? How are all your folks?\"\nSomething that for lack of any other name might be called friendship\nexisted and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel,\nin spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.\nMarilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark\nhair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little\nknot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She\nlooked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she\nwas; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had\nbeen ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative\nof a sense of humor.\n\"We're all pretty well,\" said Mrs. Rachel. \"I was kind of afraid _you_\nweren't, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe\nhe was going to the doctor's.\"\nMarilla's lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs.\nRachel up; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so\nunaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity.\n\"Oh, no, I'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday,\" she\nsaid. \"Matthew went to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an\norphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming on the train tonight.\"\nIf Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a\nkangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.\nShe was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable\nthat Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to\nsuppose it.\n\"Are you in earnest, Marilla?\" she demanded when voice returned to her.\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums\nin Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated\nAvonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.\nMrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought\nin exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people\nadopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly\nturning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this!\nNothing!\n\"What on earth put such a notion into your head?\" she demanded\ndisapprovingly.\nThis had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be\ndisapproved.\n\"Well, we've been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,\"\nreturned Marilla. \"Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before\nChristmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the\nasylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs.\nSpencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have\ntalked it over off and on ever since. We thought we'd get a boy. Matthew\nis getting up in years, you know--he's sixty--and he isn't so spry as he\nonce was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate\nhard it's got to be to get hired help. There's never anybody to be had\nbut those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do\nget one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the\nlobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a\nHome boy. But I said 'no' flat to that. 'They may be all right--I'm not\nsaying they're not--but no London street Arabs for me,' I said. 'Give\nme a native born at least. There'll be a risk, no matter who we get. But\nI'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born\nCanadian.' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out\none when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she\nwas going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer's folks at Carmody\nto bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that\nwould be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores\nright off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him\na good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer\ntoday--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming\non the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to\nmeet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to\nWhite Sands station herself.\"",

If you had asked my\nadvice in the matter--which you didn't do, Marilla--I'd have said for\nmercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what.\"\nThis Job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla.

It's so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he\ndoes I always feel it's my duty to give in. And as for the risk, there's\nrisks in pretty near everything a body does in this world. There's risks\nin people's having children of their own if it comes to that--they don't\nalways turn out well.

The long platform was\nalmost deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was\nsitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end. Matthew, barely noting\nthat it _was_ a girl, sidled past her as quickly as possible without\nlooking at her. Had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the\ntense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression. She was\nsitting there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and\nwaiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all\nher might and main.\nMatthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office\npreparatory to going home for supper, and asked him if the five-thirty\ntrain would soon be along.\n\"The five-thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago,\" answered\nthat brisk official. \"But there was a passenger dropped off for you--a\nlittle girl. She's sitting out there on the shingles. I asked her to\ngo into the ladies' waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she\npreferred to stay outside. 'There was more scope for imagination,' she\nsaid. She's a case, I should say.\"\n\"I'm not expecting a girl,\" said Matthew blankly. \"It's a boy I've come\nfor. He should be here. Mrs. Alexander Spencer was to bring him over\nfrom Nova Scotia for me.\"\nThe stationmaster whistled.\n\"Guess there's some mistake,\" he said. \"Mrs. Spencer came off the train\nwith that girl and gave her into my charge. Said you and your sister\nwere adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for\nher presently. That's all I know about it--and I haven't got any more\norphans concealed hereabouts.\"\n\"I don't understand,\" said Matthew helplessly, wishing that Marilla was\nat hand to cope with the situation.\n\"Well, you'd better question the girl,\" said the station-master\ncarelessly. \"I dare say she'll be able to explain--she's got a tongue\nof her own, that's certain. Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you\nwanted.\"\nHe walked jauntily away, being hungry, and the unfortunate Matthew was\nleft to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its\nden--walk up to a girl--a strange girl--an orphan girl--and demand of\nher why she wasn't a boy.

Matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen\nwhat she was really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would\nhave seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very\ntight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey. She wore a faded brown\nsailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids\nof very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin,\nalso much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which\nlooked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.\nSo far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen\nthat the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes\nwere full of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped\nand expressive; that the forehead was broad and full; in short,\nour discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no\ncommonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom\nshy Matthew Cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid.\nMatthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon\nas she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with\none thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag;\nthe other she held out to him.\n\"I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?\" she said in\na peculiarly clear, sweet voice. \"I'm very glad to see you.

I had made up\nmy mind that if you didn't come for me to-night I'd go down the track to\nthat big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all\nnight. I wouldn't be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a\nwild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don't you think?\nYou could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn't you? And\nI was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn't\nto-night.\"\nMatthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his; then and\nthere he decided what to do. He could not tell this child with the\nglowing eyes that there had been a mistake; he would take her home and\nlet Marilla do that. She couldn't be left at Bright River anyhow, no\nmatter what mistake had been made, so all questions and explanations\nmight as well be deferred until he was safely back at Green Gables.\n\"I'm sorry I was late,\" he said shyly. \"Come along. The horse is over in\nthe yard. Give me your bag.\"\n\"Oh, I can carry it,\" the child responded cheerfully. \"It isn't heavy.",

And if it isn't\ncarried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so I'd better\nkeep it because I know the exact knack of it. It's an extremely old\ncarpet-bag. Oh, I'm very glad you've come, even if it would have been\nnice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. We've got to drive a long piece,\nhaven't we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. I'm glad because I\nlove driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I'm going to live with you\nand belong to you. I've never belonged to anybody--not really. But the\nasylum was the worst. I've only been in it four months, but that was\nenough. I don't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you\ncan't possibly understand what it is like. It's worse than anything you\ncould imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like\nthat, but I didn't mean to be wicked. It's so easy to be wicked without\nknowing it, isn't it? They were good, you know--the asylum people. But\nthere is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just\nin the other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about\nthem--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really\nthe daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents\nin her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. I\nused to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because\nI didn't have time in the day. I guess that's why I'm so thin--I _am_\ndreadful thin, ain't I? There isn't a pick on my bones. I do love to\nimagine I'm nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows.\"\nWith this Matthew's companion stopped talking, partly because she was\nout of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy. Not another\nword did she say until they had left the village and were driving down\na steep little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into\nthe soft soil, that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees\nand slim white birches, were several feet above their heads.\nThe child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that\nbrushed against the side of the buggy.\n\"Isn't that beautiful? What did that tree, leaning out from the bank,\nall white and lacy, make you think of?\" she asked.\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Why, a bride, of course--a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil.\nI've never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like. I don't\never expect to be a bride myself. I'm so homely nobody will ever want to\nmarry me--unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign\nmissionary mightn't be very particular. But I do hope that some day I\nshall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I\njust love pretty clothes. And I've never had a pretty dress in my life\nthat I can remember--but of course it's all the more to look forward\nto, isn't it? And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously. This\nmorning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear\nthis horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you\nknow. A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of\nwincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn't sell\nit, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart,\nwouldn't you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be\nlooking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that\nI had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you _are_\nimagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big\nhat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and\nboots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island\nwith all my might. I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither\nwas Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn't time\nto get sick, watching to see that I didn't fall overboard. She said she\nnever saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from\nbeing seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it? And I wanted to see\neverything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn't know\nwhether I'd ever have another opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more\ncherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just\nlove it already, and I'm so glad I'm going to live here. I've always\nheard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world,\nand I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I\nwould. It's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it?\nBut those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at\nCharlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer\nwhat made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not\nto ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand\nalready. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about\nthings if you don't ask questions? And what _does_ make the roads red?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn't it splendid\nto think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes\nme feel glad to be alive--it's such an interesting world. It wouldn't be\nhalf so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There'd\nbe no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I talking too\nmuch? People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I didn't\ntalk? If you say so I'll stop. I can _stop_ when I make up my mind to it,",

            "text": "although it's difficult.\"\nMatthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet\nfolks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking\nthemselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had\nnever expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad\nenough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the\nway they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if\nthey expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to\nsay a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But\nthis freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather\ndifficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental\nprocesses he thought that he \"kind of liked her chatter.\" So he said as\nshyly as usual:\n\"Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don't mind.\"\n\"Oh, I'm so glad. I know you and I are going to get along together\nfine. It's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told\nthat children should be seen and not heard. I've had that said to me a\nmillion times if I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big\nwords. But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express\nthem, haven't you?\"\n\"Well now, that seems reasonable,\" said Matthew.\n\"Mrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. But it\nisn't--it's firmly fastened at one end. Mrs. Spencer said your place was\nnamed Green Gables. I asked her all about it. And she said there were\ntrees all around it. I was gladder than ever. I just love trees. And\nthere weren't any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny\nthings out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them.\nThey just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did. It used to\nmake me want to cry to look at them. I used to say to them, 'Oh, you\n_poor_ little things! If you were out in a great big woods with other\ntrees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your\nroots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you\ncould grow, couldn't you? But you can't where you are. I know just\nexactly how you feel, little trees.' I felt sorry to leave them behind\nthis morning. You do get so attached to things like that, don't you? Is\nthere a brook anywhere near Green Gables? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer\nthat.\"\n\"Well now, yes, there's one right below the house.\"\n\"Fancy. It's always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I\nnever expected I would, though. Dreams don't often come true, do they?\nWouldn't it be nice if they did? But just now I feel pretty nearly\nperfectly happy. I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because--well,\nwhat color would you call this?\"\nShe twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and\nheld it up before Matthew's eyes. Matthew was not used to deciding on\nthe tints of ladies' tresses, but in this case there couldn't be much\ndoubt.\n\"It's red, ain't it?\" he said.\nThe girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from\nher very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.\n\"Yes, it's red,\" she said resignedly. \"Now you see why I can't be\nperfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don't mind the other\nthings so much--the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness. I\ncan imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf\ncomplexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I _cannot_ imagine that\nred hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, 'Now my hair is a\nglorious black, black as the raven's wing.' But all the time I _know_ it\nis just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong sorrow.\nI read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn't\nred hair. Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow.\nWhat is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell me?\"\n\"Well now, I'm afraid I can't,\" said Matthew, who was getting a little\ndizzy. He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy\nhad enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic.\n\"Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was\ndivinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be\ndivinely beautiful?\"\n\"Well now, no, I haven't,\" confessed Matthew ingenuously.\n\"I have, often. Which would you rather be if you had the\nchoice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?\"\n\"Well now, I--I don't know exactly.\"\n\"Neither do I. I can never decide. But it doesn't make much real\ndifference for it isn't likely I'll ever be either. It's certain I'll\nnever be angelically good. Mrs. Spencer says--oh, Mr. Cuthbert! Oh, Mr.\nCuthbert!! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!!!\"\nThat was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled\nout of the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing. They had\nsimply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the \"Avenue.\"\nThe \"Avenue,\" so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of road\nfour or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge,\nwide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old\nfarmer. Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom. Below the\nboughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse\nof painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a\ncathedral aisle.\nIts beauty seemed to strike the child dumb. She leaned back in the\nbuggy, her thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to\nthe white splendor above. Even when they had passed out and were driving\ndown the long slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke. Still with\nrapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw\nvisions trooping splendidly across that glowing background. Through\nNewbridge, a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small\nboys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows, they drove, still\nin silence. When three more miles had dropped away behind them the child\nhad not spoken. She could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically\nas she could talk.\n\"I guess you're feeling pretty tired and hungry,\" Matthew ventured to\nsay at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the\nonly reason he could think of. \"But we haven't very far to go now--only\nanother mile.\"\nShe came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the\ndreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led.\n\"Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,\" she whispered, \"that place we came through--that\nwhite place--what was it?\"\n\"Well now, you must mean the Avenue,\" said Matthew after a few moments'\nprofound reflection. \"It is a kind of pretty place.\"\n\"Pretty? Oh, _pretty_ doesn't seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful,\neither. They don't go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful--wonderful.\nIt's the first thing I ever saw that couldn't be improved upon by\nimagination. It just satisfies me here\"--she put one hand on her\nbreast--\"it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache. Did\nyou ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?\"\n\"Well now, I just can't recollect that I ever had.\"\n\"I have it lots of time--whenever I see anything royally beautiful. But\nthey shouldn't call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning\nin a name like that. They should call it--let me see--the White Way of\nDelight. Isn't that a nice imaginative name? When I don't like the name\nof a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of\nthem so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins,\nbut I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that",

            "text": "place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight.\nHave we really only another mile to go before we get home? I'm glad and\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I'm\nalways sorry when pleasant things end. Something still pleasanter may\ncome after, but you can never be sure. And it's so often the case that\nit isn't pleasanter. That has been my experience anyhow. But I'm glad to\nthink of getting home. You see, I've never had a real home since I can\nremember. It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming\nto a really truly home. Oh, isn't that pretty!\"\nThey had driven over the crest of a hill. Below them was a pond, looking\nalmost like a river so long and winding was it. A bridge spanned it\nmidway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of\nsand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a\nglory of many shifting hues--the most spiritual shadings of crocus and\nrose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name\nhas ever been found. Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing\ngroves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering\nshadows. Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a\nwhite-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection. From the marsh at the\nhead of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.\nThere was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on\na slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was\nshining from one of its windows.\n\"That's Barry's pond,\" said Matthew.\n\"Oh, I don't like that name, either. I shall call it--let me see--the\nLake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it. I know\nbecause of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives\nme a thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?\"\nMatthew ruminated.\n\"Well now, yes. It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly\nwhite grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. I hate the look of\nthem.\"\n\"Oh, I don't think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you\nthink it can? There doesn't seem to be much connection between grubs\nand lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it\nBarry's pond?\"\n\"I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house. Orchard\nSlope's the name of his place. If it wasn't for that big bush behind it\nyou could see Green Gables from here. But we have to go over the bridge\nand round by the road, so it's near half a mile further.\"\n\"Has Mr. Barry any little girls? Well, not so very little either--about\nmy size.\"\n\"He's got one about eleven. Her name is Diana.\"\n\"Oh!\" with a long indrawing of breath. \"What a perfectly lovely name!\"\n\"Well now, I dunno. There's something dreadful heathenish about it,\nseems to me. I'd ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that.\nBut when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they\ngave him the naming of her and he called her Diana.\"\n\"I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born,\nthen. Oh, here we are at the bridge. I'm going to shut my eyes tight.\nI'm always afraid going over bridges. I can't help imagining that\nperhaps just as we get to the middle, they'll crumple up like a\njack-knife and nip us. So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them\nfor all when I think we're getting near the middle. Because, you see, if\nthe bridge _did_ crumple up I'd want to _see_ it crumple. What a jolly\nrumble it makes! I always like the rumble part of it. Isn't it splendid\nthere are so many things to like in this world? There we're over. Now\nI'll look back. Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters. I always say\ngood night to the things I love, just as I would to people. I think they\nlike it. That water looks as if it was smiling at me.\"\nWhen they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew\nsaid:\n\"We're pretty near home now. That's Green Gables over--\"\n\"Oh, don't tell me,\" she interrupted breathlessly, catching at his\npartially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his\ngesture. \"Let me guess. I'm sure I'll guess right.\"\nShe opened her eyes and looked about her. They were on the crest of a\nhill. The sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still\nclear in the mellow afterlight. To the west a dark church spire rose\nup against a marigold sky. Below was a little valley and beyond a long,\ngently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it. From one\nto another the child's eyes darted, eager and wistful. At last they\nlingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white\nwith blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods. Over it,\nin the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining\nlike a lamp of guidance and promise.\n\"That's it, isn't it?\" she said, pointing.\nMatthew slapped the reins on the sorrel's back delightedly.\n\"Well now, you've guessed it! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it\nso's you could tell.\"\n\"No, she didn't--really she didn't. All she said might just as well have\nbeen about most of those other places. I hadn't any real idea what it\nlooked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home. Oh, it\nseems as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and\nblue from the elbow up, for I've pinched myself so many times today.\nEvery little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and\nI'd be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I'd pinch myself to see if it\nwas real--until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only\na dream I'd better go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped\npinching. But it _is_ real and we're nearly home.\"\nWith a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred\nuneasily. He felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he who would\nhave to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was\nnot to be hers after all. They drove over Lynde's Hollow, where it was\nalready quite dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them\nfrom her window vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green\nGables. By the time they arrived at the house Matthew was shrinking from\nthe approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand. It was\nnot of Marilla or himself he was thinking or of the trouble this mistake\nwas probably going to make for them, but of the child's disappointment.\nWhen he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had\nan uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering\nsomething--much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill\na lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature.\nThe yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves\nwere rustling silkily all round it.\n\"Listen to the trees talking in their sleep,\" she whispered, as he\nlifted her to the ground. \"What nice dreams they must have!\"\nThen, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained \"all her worldly\ngoods,\" she followed him into the house.",

But, although it was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the\nthing to put a girl there somehow. But the spare room was out of the\nquestion for such a stray waif, so there remained only the east gable\nroom. Marilla lighted a candle and told Anne to follow her, which Anne\nspiritlessly did, taking her hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as\nshe passed. The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in\nwhich she presently found herself seemed still cleaner.\nMarilla set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and\nturned down the bedclothes.\n\"I suppose you have a nightgown?\" she questioned.\nAnne nodded.\n\"Yes, I have two. The matron of the asylum made them for me. They're\nfearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so\nthings are always skimpy--at least in a poor asylum like ours. I hate\nskimpy night-dresses. But one can dream just as well in them as\nin lovely trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that's one\nconsolation.\"\n\"Well, undress as quick as you can and go to bed. I'll come back in a\nfew minutes for the candle. I daren't trust you to put it out yourself.\nYou'd likely set the place on fire.\"\nWhen Marilla had gone Anne looked around her wistfully. The whitewashed\nwalls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache\nover their own bareness. The floor was bare, too, except for a round\nbraided mat in the middle such as Anne had never seen before. In\none corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark,\nlow-turned posts. In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner\ntable adorned with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the\npoint of the most adventurous pin. Above it hung a little six-by-eight\nmirror. Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white\nmuslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The whole\napartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which\nsent a shiver to the very marrow of Anne's bones. With a sob she hastily\ndiscarded her garments, put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed\nwhere she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes\nover her head. When Marilla came up for the light various skimpy\narticles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain\ntempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any",

First came a\ndelightful thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible\nremembrance. This was Green Gables and they didn't want her because she\nwasn't a boy!\nBut it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside\nof her window. With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor.\nShe pushed up the sash--it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn't\nbeen opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight\nthat nothing was needed to hold it up.\nAnne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning, her eyes\nglistening with delight. Oh, wasn't it beautiful? Wasn't it a lovely\nplace? Suppose she wasn't really going to stay here! She would imagine\nshe was. There was scope for imagination here.\nA huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against\nthe house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf\nwas to be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of\napple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms;\nand their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below\nwere lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance\ndrifted up to the window on the morning wind.\nBelow the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the\nhollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew,\nupspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful\npossibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally. Beyond it\nwas a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in\nit where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the\nother side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible.\nOff to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over\ngreen, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.\nAnne's beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily\nin. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child;\nbut this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.\nShe knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until\nshe was startled by a hand on her shoulder.

But is\nwas done somehow and smoothed down; and then Marilla, to get rid of her,\ntold her she might go out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinner time.\nAnne flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing. On the very threshold\nshe stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table,\nlight and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an\nextinguisher on her.\n\"What's the matter now?\" demanded Marilla.\n\"I don't dare go out,\" said Anne, in the tone of a martyr relinquishing\nall earthly joys. \"If I can't stay here there is no use in my loving\nGreen Gables. And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those\ntrees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I'll not be able to help\nloving it. It's hard enough now, so I won't make it any harder. I want\nto go out so much--everything seems to be calling to me, 'Anne, Anne,\ncome out to us. Anne, Anne, we want a playmate'--but it's better not.\nThere is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them, is\nthere? And it's so hard to keep from loving things, isn't it? That was\nwhy I was so glad when I thought I was going to live here. I thought\nI'd have so many things to love and nothing to hinder me. But that brief\ndream is over. I am resigned to my fate now, so I don't think I'll\ngo out for fear I'll get unresigned again. What is the name of that\ngeranium on the window-sill, please?\"\n\"That's the apple-scented geranium.\"\n\"Oh, I don't mean that sort of a name. I mean just a name you gave it\nyourself. Didn't you give it a name? May I give it one then? May I call\nit--let me see--Bonny would do--may I call it Bonny while I'm here? Oh,\ndo let me!\"\n\"Goodness, I don't care. But where on earth is the sense of naming a\ngeranium?\"\n\"Oh, I like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums. It\nmakes them seem more like people. How do you know but that it hurts a\ngeranium's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else? You\nwouldn't like to be called nothing but a woman all the time. Yes, I\nshall call it Bonny. I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window\nthis morning. I called it Snow Queen because it was so white. Of course,\nit won't always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can't\none?\"\n\"I never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her,\" muttered\nMarilla, beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes. \"She\nis kind of interesting as Matthew says. I can feel already that I'm\nwondering what on earth she'll say next. She'll be casting a spell over\nme, too. She's cast it over Matthew. That look he gave me when he went",

            "text": "\"It's five miles; and as you're evidently bent on talking you might as\nwell talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself.\"\n\"Oh, what I _know_ about myself isn't really worth telling,\" said Anne\neagerly. \"If you'll only let me tell you what I _imagine_ about myself\nyou'll think it ever so much more interesting.\"\n\"No, I don't want any of your imaginings. Just you stick to bald facts.\nBegin at the beginning. Where were you born and how old are you?\"\n\"I was eleven last March,\" said Anne, resigning herself to bald facts\nwith a little sigh. \"And I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.\nMy father's name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the\nBolingbroke High School. My mother's name was Bertha Shirley. Aren't\nWalter and Bertha lovely names? I'm so glad my parents had nice names.\nIt would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\"I guess it doesn't matter what a person's name is as long as he behaves\nhimself,\" said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good\nand useful moral.\n\"Well, I don't know.\" Anne looked thoughtful. \"I read in a book once\nthat a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've never been\nable to believe it. I don't believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was\ncalled a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been\na good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but I'm sure it would\nhave been a cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school,\ntoo, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A\nhusband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were\na pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a\nweeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. I've never seen that\nhouse, but I've imagined it thousands of times. I think it must have\nhad honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and\nlilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in\nall the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born\nin that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I\nwas so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I\nwas perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge\nthan a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn't you? I'm glad she\nwas satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a\ndisappointment to her--because she didn't live very long after that, you\nsee. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she'd\nlived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it\nwould be so sweet to say 'mother,' don't you? And father died four days\nafterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at\ntheir wits' end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see,\nnobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother\nhad both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn't any\nrelatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she'd take me, though she was\npoor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up by hand. Do you know\nif there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make\npeople who are brought up that way better than other people? Because\nwhenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a\nbad girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I\nlived with them until I was eight years old. I helped look after the\nThomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and I can tell\nyou they took a lot of looking after. Then Mr. Thomas was killed\nfalling under a train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the\nchildren, but she didn't want me. Mrs. Thomas was at _her_ wits' end, so\nshe said, what to do with me. Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came\ndown and said she'd take me, seeing I was handy with children, and\nI went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the\nstumps. It was a very lonesome place. I'm sure I could never have\nlived there if I hadn't had an imagination. Mr. Hammond worked a little\nsawmill up there, and Mrs. Hammond had eight children. She had twins\nthree times. I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in\nsuccession is _too much_. I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly, when the last\npair came. I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about.\n\"I lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond\ndied and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She divided her children\namong her relatives and went to the States. I had to go to the asylum\nat Hopeton, because nobody would take me. They didn't want me at the\nasylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had\nto take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came.\"\nAnne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time. Evidently\nshe did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not\nwanted her.",

You'll put your horse in? And how\nare you, Anne?\"\n\"I'm as well as can be expected, thank you,\" said Anne smilelessly. A\nblight seemed to have descended on her.\n\"I suppose we'll stay a little while to rest the mare,\" said Marilla,\n\"but I promised Matthew I'd be home early. The fact is, Mrs. Spencer,\nthere's been a queer mistake somewhere, and I've come over to see where\nit is. We send word, Matthew and I, for you to bring us a boy from the\nasylum. We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or\neleven years old.\"\n\"Marilla Cuthbert, you don't say so!\" said Mrs. Spencer in distress.\n\"Why, Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you\nwanted a girl--didn't she Flora Jane?\" appealing to her daughter who had\ncome out to the steps.\n\"She certainly did, Miss Cuthbert,\" corroborated Flora Jane earnestly.\n\"I'm dreadful sorry,\" said Mrs. Spencer. \"It's too bad; but it certainly\nwasn't my fault, you see, Miss Cuthbert. I did the best I could and I\nthought I was following your instructions. Nancy is a terrible flighty\nthing. I've often had to scold her well for her heedlessness.\"\n\"It was our own fault,\" said Marilla resignedly. \"We should have come\nto you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by\nword of mouth in that fashion. Anyhow, the mistake has been made and the\nonly thing to do is to set it right. Can we send the child back to the\nasylum? I suppose they'll take her back, won't they?\"\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, \"but I don't think\nit will be necessary to send her back. Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here\nyesterday, and she was saying to me how much she wished she'd sent by me\nfor a little girl to help her. Mrs. Peter has a large family, you know,\nand she finds it hard to get help. Anne will be the very girl for you. I\ncall it positively providential.\"\nMarilla did not look as if she thought Providence had much to do with\nthe matter. Here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome\norphan off her hands, and she did not even feel grateful for it.\nShe knew Mrs. Peter Blewett only by sight as a small, shrewish-faced\nwoman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones. But she had\nheard of her. \"A terrible worker and driver,\" Mrs. Peter was said to\nbe; and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and\nstinginess, and her family of pert, quarrelsome children.

Take the armchair, Miss\nCuthbert. Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don't wiggle. Let\nme take your hats. Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on. Good\nafternoon, Mrs. Blewett.

I forgot to tell Flora\nJane to take the buns out of the oven.\"\nMrs. Spencer whisked away, after pulling up the blinds. Anne sitting\nmutely on the ottoman, with her hands clasped tightly in her lap, stared\nat Mrs Blewett as one fascinated. Was she to be given into the keeping\nof this sharp-faced, sharp-eyed woman? She felt a lump coming up in her\nthroat and her eyes smarted painfully. She was beginning to be afraid\nshe couldn't keep the tears back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed\nand beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical,\nmental or spiritual, into consideration and settling it out of hand.\n\"It seems there's been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs. Blewett,\"\nshe said. \"I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted\na little girl to adopt. I was certainly told so. But it seems it was a\nboy they wanted. So if you're still of the same mind you were yesterday,\nI think she'll be just the thing for you.\"\nMrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.\n\"How old are you and what's your name?\" she demanded.\n\"Anne Shirley,\" faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make any\nstipulations regarding the spelling thereof, \"and I'm eleven years old.\"\n\"Humph! You don't look as if there was much to you. But you're wiry. I\ndon't know but the wiry ones are the best after all. Well, if I take you\nyou'll have to be a good girl, you know--good and smart and respectful.\nI'll expect you to earn your keep, and no mistake about that. Yes, I\nsuppose I might as well take her off your hands, Miss Cuthbert. The\nbaby's awful fractious, and I'm clean worn out attending to him. If you\nlike I can take her right home now.\"\nMarilla looked at Anne and softened at sight of the child's pale face\nwith its look of mute misery--the misery of a helpless little creature\nwho finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.\nMarilla felt an uncomfortable conviction that, if she denied the appeal\nof that look, it would haunt her to her dying day. More-over, she did\nnot fancy Mrs. Blewett. To hand a sensitive, \"highstrung\" child over to\nsuch a woman! No, she could not take the responsibility of doing that!\n\"Well, I don't know,\" she said slowly. \"I didn't say that Matthew and I\nhad absolutely decided that we wouldn't keep her. In fact I may say that\nMatthew is disposed to keep her. I just came over to find out how the\nmistake had occurred. I think I'd better take her home again and talk it\nover with Matthew. I feel that I oughtn't to decide on anything without\nconsulting him. If we make up our mind not to keep her we'll bring or\nsend her over to you tomorrow night. If we don't you may know that she\nis going to stay with us. Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?\"",

She was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he\nsaw that she had at least brought back Anne back with her. But she said\nnothing, to him, relative to the affair, until they were both out in the\nyard behind the barn milking the cows. Then she briefly told him Anne's\nhistory and the result of the interview with Mrs. Spencer.\n\"I wouldn't give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman,\" said Matthew with\nunusual vim.\n\"I don't fancy her style myself,\" admitted Marilla, \"but it's that\nor keeping her ourselves, Matthew. And since you seem to want her, I\nsuppose I'm willing--or have to be. I've been thinking over the idea\nuntil I've got kind of used to it. It seems a sort of duty. I've never\nbrought up a child, especially a girl, and I dare say I'll make a\nterrible mess of it. But I'll do my best. So far as I'm concerned,\nMatthew, she may stay.\"\nMatthew's shy face was a glow of delight.\n\"Well now, I reckoned you'd come to see it in that light, Marilla,\" he\nsaid. \"She's such an interesting little thing.\"\n\"It'd be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little\nthing,\" retorted Marilla, \"but I'll make it my business to see she's\ntrained to be that. And mind, Matthew, you're not to go interfering with\nmy methods. Perhaps an old maid doesn't know much about bringing up\na child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor. So you just\nleave me to manage her. When I fail it'll be time enough to put your oar\nin.\"\n\"There, there, Marilla, you can have your own way,\" said Matthew\nreassuringly. \"Only be as good and kind to her as you can without\nspoiling her. I kind of think she's one of the sort you can do anything\nwith if you only get her to love you.\"\nMarilla sniffed, to express her contempt for Matthew's opinions\nconcerning anything feminine, and walked off to the dairy with the\npails.\n\"I won't tell her tonight that she can stay,\" she reflected, as she\nstrained the milk into the creamers. \"She'd be so excited that she\nwouldn't sleep a wink. Marilla Cuthbert, you're fairly in for it. Did\nyou ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan\ngirl? It's surprising enough; but not so surprising as that Matthew\nshould be at the bottom of it, him that always seemed to have such a\nmortal dread of little girls.

I haven't any use at all for\nlittle girls who aren't neat.\"\n\"I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn't think about my\nclothes at all,\" said Anne. \"I'll fold them nicely tonight. They always\nmade us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though, I'd forget, I'd be\nin such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things.\"\n\"You'll have to remember a little better if you stay here,\" admonished\nMarilla. \"There, that looks something like. Say your prayers now and get\ninto bed.\"\n\"I never say any prayers,\" announced Anne.\nMarilla looked horrified astonishment.\n\"Why, Anne, what do you mean? Were you never taught to say your prayers?\nGod always wants little girls to say their prayers. Don't you know who\nGod is, Anne?\"\n\"'God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable, in His being,\nwisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth,'\" responded Anne\npromptly and glibly.\nMarilla looked rather relieved.\n\"So you do know something then, thank goodness! You're not quite a\nheathen. Where did you learn that?\"\n\"Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole\ncatechism. I liked it pretty well. There's something splendid about some\nof the words. 'Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.' Isn't that grand? It\nhas such a roll to it--just like a big organ playing. You couldn't quite\ncall it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn't it?\"\n\"We're not talking about poetry, Anne--we are talking about saying your\nprayers. Don't you know it's a terrible wicked thing not to say your\nprayers every night? I'm afraid you are a very bad little girl.\"\n\"You'd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,\" said\nAnne reproachfully. \"People who haven't red hair don't know what trouble\nis. Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red _on purpose_, and I've\nnever cared about Him since. And anyhow I'd always be too tired at night\nto bother saying prayers. People who have to look after twins can't be\nexpected to say their prayers. Now, do you honestly think they can?\"\nMarilla decided that Anne's religious training must be begun at once.\nPlainly there was no time to be lost.\n\"You must say your prayers while you are under my roof, Anne.\"\n\"Why, of course, if you want me to,\" assented Anne cheerfully. \"I'd do\nanything to oblige you.

During the\nforenoon she kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her\nwith a keen eye while she did them. By noon she had concluded that Anne\nwas smart and obedient, willing to work and quick to learn; her most\nserious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in\nthe middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was\nsharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe.\nWhen Anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted\nMarilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to\nlearn the worst. Her thin little body trembled from head to foot; her\nface flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black; she\nclasped her hands tightly and said in an imploring voice:\n\"Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won't you tell me if you are going to send\nme away or not? I've tried to be patient all the morning, but I really\nfeel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It's a dreadful feeling.\nPlease tell me.\"\n\"You haven't scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to\ndo,\" said Marilla immovably. \"Just go and do it before you ask any more\nquestions, Anne.\"\nAnne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she returned to Marilla\nand fastened imploring eyes of the latter's face. \"Well,\" said Marilla,\nunable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer, \"I\nsuppose I might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep\nyou--that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself\ngrateful. Why, child, whatever is the matter?\"",

The Lord's Prayer is on it and you'll devote your spare\ntime this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There's to be no more\nof such praying as I heard last night.\"\n\"I suppose I was very awkward,\" said Anne apologetically, \"but then, you\nsee, I'd never had any practice. You couldn't really expect a person\nto pray very well the first time she tried, could you? I thought out a\nsplendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would.\nIt was nearly as long as a minister's and so poetical. But would you\nbelieve it? I couldn't remember one word when I woke up this morning.\nAnd I'm afraid I'll never be able to think out another one as good.\nSomehow, things never are so good when they're thought out a second\ntime. Have you ever noticed that?\"\n\"Here is something for you to notice, Anne. When I tell you to do\na thing I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and\ndiscourse about it. Just you go and do as I bid you.\"\nAnne promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall; she failed\nto return; after waiting ten minutes Marilla laid down her knitting\nand marched after her with a grim expression. She found Anne standing\nmotionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows,\nwith her eyes a-star with dreams. The white and green light strained\nthrough apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt\nlittle figure with a half-unearthly radiance.\n\"Anne, whatever are you thinking of?\" demanded Marilla sharply.\nAnne came back to earth with a start.\n\"That,\" she said, pointing to the picture--a rather vivid chromo\nentitled, \"Christ Blessing Little Children\"--\"and I was just imagining I\nwas one of them--that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing\noff by herself in the corner as if she didn't belong to anybody, like\nme. She looks lonely and sad, don't you think? I guess she hadn't any\nfather or mother of her own. But she wanted to be blessed, too, so she\njust crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody would\nnotice her--except Him. I'm sure I know just how she felt. Her heart\nmust have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when I\nasked you if I could stay. She was afraid He mightn't notice her. But\nit's likely He did, don't you think? I've been trying to imagine it all\nout--her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite close\nto Him; and then He would look at her and put His hand on her hair and\noh, such a thrill of joy as would run over her! But I wish the artist\nhadn't painted Him so sorrowful looking. All His pictures are like that,\nif you've noticed. But I don't believe He could really have looked so\nsad or the children would have been afraid of Him.\"\n\"Anne,\" said Marilla, wondering why she had not broken into this speech\nlong before, \"you shouldn't talk that way. It's irreverent--positively\nirreverent.\"\nAnne's eyes marveled.\n\"Why, I felt just as reverent as could be. I'm sure I didn't mean to be\nirreverent.\"\n\"Well I don't suppose you did--but it doesn't sound right to talk so\nfamiliarly about such things. And another thing, Anne, when I send you\nafter something you're to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and\nimagining before pictures. Remember that. Take that card and come right\nto the kitchen. Now, sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by\nheart.\"",

She won't let Diana play with any little girl who\nisn't nice and good.\"\nAnne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with\ninterest.\n\"What is Diana like? Her hair isn't red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It's bad\nenough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn't endure it in a\nbosom friend.\"\n\"Diana is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and\nrosy cheeks. And she is good and smart, which is better than being\npretty.\"\nMarilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was\nfirmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a\nchild who was being brought up.\nBut Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the\ndelightful possibilities before it.\n\"Oh, I'm so glad she's pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself--and\nthat's impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom\nfriend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting\nroom with glass doors. There weren't any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept\nher best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to\nkeep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night\nwhen he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to\npretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in\nit. I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to\ntalk to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything.\nKatie was the comfort and consolation of my life. We used to pretend\nthat the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I\ncould open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice\nlived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas' shelves of preserves and china. And\nthen Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a\nwonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have\nlived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond\nit just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully,\ntoo, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye\nthrough the bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond's. But\njust up the river a little way from the house there was a long green\nlittle valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every\nword you said, even if you didn't talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it\nwas a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved\nher almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you\nknow. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta,\nand oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had\nbecome so attached to her that I hadn't the heart to imagine a bosom\nfriend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination\nthere.\"\n\"I think it's just as well there wasn't,\" said Marilla drily. \"I\ndon't approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe your own\nimaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to\nput such nonsense out of your head. But don't let Mrs. Barry hear you\ntalking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she'll think you\ntell stories.\"",

When details were exhausted Mrs. Rachel introduced the\nreal reason of her call.\n\"I've been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew.\"\n\"I don't suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself,\" said\nMarilla. \"I'm getting over my surprise now.\"\n\"It was too bad there was such a mistake,\" said Mrs. Rachel\nsympathetically. \"Couldn't you have sent her back?\"\n\"I suppose we could, but we decided not to. Matthew took a fancy to her.\nAnd I must say I like her myself--although I admit she has her faults.\nThe house seems a different place already. She's a real bright little\nthing.\"\nMarilla said more than she had intended to say when she began, for she\nread disapproval in Mrs. Rachel's expression.\n\"It's a great responsibility you've taken on yourself,\" said that\nlady gloomily, \"especially when you've never had any experience with\nchildren. You don't know much about her or her real disposition, I\nsuppose, and there's no guessing how a child like that will turn out.\nBut I don't want to discourage you I'm sure, Marilla.\"\n\"I'm not feeling discouraged,\" was Marilla's dry response, \"when I make\nup my mind to do a thing it stays made up. I suppose you'd like to see\nAnne. I'll call her in.\"\nAnne came running in presently, her face sparkling with the delight of\nher orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in\nthe unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside\nthe door. She certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short\ntight wincey dress she had worn from the asylum, below which her thin\nlegs seemed ungracefully long. Her freckles were more numerous and\nobtrusive than ever; the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into\nover-brilliant disorder; it had never looked redder than at that moment.\n\"Well, they didn't pick you for your looks, that's sure and certain,\"\nwas Mrs. Rachel Lynde's emphatic comment. Mrs. Rachel was one of those\ndelightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their\nmind without fear or favor. \"She's terrible skinny and homely, Marilla.\nCome here, child, and let me have a look at you. Lawful heart, did\nany one ever see such freckles? And hair as red as carrots! Come here,\nchild, I say.\"\nAnne \"came there,\" but not exactly as Mrs. Rachel expected.

Mrs. Rachel got up with an air\nof offended dignity.\n\"Well, I see that I'll have to be very careful what I say after this,\nMarilla, since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness\nknows where, have to be considered before anything else. Oh, no, I'm not\nvexed--don't worry yourself. I'm too sorry for you to leave any room for\nanger in my mind. You'll have your own troubles with that child.

I hope you'll come down to\nsee me often as usual. But you can't expect me to visit here again in a\nhurry, if I'm liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion. It's\nsomething new in _my_ experience.\"\nWhereat Mrs. Rachel swept out and away--if a fat woman who always\nwaddled _could_ be said to sweep away--and Marilla with a very solemn face\nbetook herself to the east gable.\nOn the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do.\nShe felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted.\nHow unfortunate that Anne should have displayed such temper before Mrs.\nRachel Lynde, of all people! Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an\nuncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation\nover this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect\nin Anne's disposition. And how was she to punish her? The amiable\nsuggestion of the birch switch--to the efficiency of which all of Mrs.\nRachel's own children could have borne smarting testimony--did not\nappeal to Marilla.

How can\nI? I'm _not_ sorry. I'm sorry I've vexed you; but I'm _glad_ I told her just\nwhat I did. It was a great satisfaction. I can't say I'm sorry when I'm\nnot, can I?

As\na general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little\nbedroom off the hall where he slept; once in a while he ventured\nuncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to\ntea. But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he\nhelped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.\nHe tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the\ndoor of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his\nfingers and then open the door to peep in.\nAnne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out\ninto the garden. Very small and unhappy she looked, and Matthew's heart\nsmote him. He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her.\n\"Anne,\" he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, \"how are you\nmaking it, Anne?\"\nAnne smiled wanly.\n\"Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of\ncourse, it's rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that.\"\nAnne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary\nimprisonment before her.\nMatthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without\nloss of time, lest Marilla return prematurely. \"Well now, Anne, don't\nyou think you'd better do it and have it over with?\" he whispered.\n\"It'll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla's a\ndreadful deter-mined woman--dreadful determined, Anne. Do it right off,\nI say, and have it over.\"\n\"Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?\"\n\"Yes--apologize--that's the very word,\" said Matthew eagerly. \"Just\nsmooth it over so to speak. That's what I was trying to get at.\"\n\"I suppose I could do it to oblige you,\" said Anne thoughtfully. \"It\nwould be true enough to say I am sorry, because I _am_ sorry now. I wasn't\na bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all\nnight. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just\nfurious every time. But this morning it was over. I wasn't in a temper\nanymore--and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed\nof myself. But I just couldn't think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde\nso. It would be so humiliating. I made up my mind I'd stay shut up here\nforever rather than do that. But still--I'd do anything for you--if you\nreally want me to--\"\n\"Well now, of course I do. It's terrible lonesome downstairs without\nyou. Just go and smooth things over--that's a good girl.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Anne resignedly. \"I'll tell Marilla as soon as she\ncomes in I've repented.\"\n\"That's right--that's right, Anne. But don't tell Marilla I said\nanything about it. She might think I was putting my oar in and I\npromised not to do that.\"\n\"Wild horses won't drag the secret from me,\" promised Anne solemnly.\n\"How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?\"\nBut Matthew was gone, scared at his own success. He fled hastily to the\nremotest corner of the horse pasture lest Marilla should suspect what",

Both Marilla and Mrs. Lynde recognized its unmistakable ring.\nBut the former under-stood in dismay that Anne was actually enjoying\nher valley of humiliation--was reveling in the thoroughness of her\nabasement. Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla,\nhad plumed herself? Anne had turned it into a species of positive\npleasure.\nGood Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see\nthis. She only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and\nall resentment vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart.\n\"There, there, get up, child,\" she said heartily. \"Of course I forgive\nyou. I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway. But I'm such an\noutspoken person. You just mustn't mind me, that's what.

I shall always feel that you are a benefactor. Oh,\nI could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome\nauburn when I grew up. It would be so much easier to be good if one's",

She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold\nAnne for apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous! She\ncompromised with her conscience by saying severely:\n\"I hope you won't have occasion to make many more such apologies. I hope\nyou'll try to control your temper now, Anne.\"\n\"That wouldn't be so hard if people wouldn't twit me about my looks,\"\nsaid Anne with a sigh. \"I don't get cross about other things; but I'm\n_so_ tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right\nover. Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I\ngrow up?\"\n\"You shouldn't think so much about your looks, Anne. I'm afraid you are\na very vain little girl.\"\n\"How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?\" protested Anne. \"I love\npretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that\nisn't pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful--just as I feel when I look\nat any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn't beautiful.\"\n\"Handsome is as handsome does,\" quoted Marilla. \"I've had that said\nto me before, but I have my doubts about it,\" remarked skeptical Anne,\nsniffing at her narcissi. \"Oh, aren't these flowers sweet! It was lovely\nof Mrs. Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings against Mrs.\nLynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and\nbe forgiven, doesn't it? Aren't the stars bright tonight? If you could\nlive in a star, which one would you pick? I'd like that lovely clear big\none away over there above that dark hill.\"\n\"Anne, do hold your tongue,\" said Marilla, thoroughly worn out trying to\nfollow the gyrations of Anne's thoughts.\nAnne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy\nwind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young\ndew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out\nthrough the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came\nclose to Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman's hard palm.\n\"It's lovely to be going home and know it's home,\" she said. \"I love\nGreen Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever\nseemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I'm so happy. I could pray right now and\nnot find it a bit hard.\"\nSomething warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla's heart at touch of\nthat thin little hand in her own--a throb of the maternity she had\nmissed, perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed\nher. She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by\ninculcating a moral.\n\"If you'll be a good girl you'll always be happy, Anne. And you should\nnever find it hard to say your prayers.\"\n\"Saying one's prayers isn't exactly the same thing as praying,\" said\nAnne meditatively. \"But I'm going to imagine that I'm the wind that is\nblowing up there in those tree tops. When I get tired of the trees I'll\nimagine I'm gently waving down here in the ferns--and then I'll fly over\nto Mrs. Lynde's garden and set the flowers dancing--and then I'll go\nwith one great swoop over the clover field--and then I'll blow over the\nLake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves.\nOh, there's so much scope for imagination in a wind! So I'll not talk\nany more just now, Marilla.\"\n\"Thanks be to goodness for that,\" breathed Marilla in devout relief.",

One was of snuffy colored gingham which\nMarilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer\nbecause it looked so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered\nsateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and\none was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that\nweek at a Carmody store.\nShe had made them up herself, and they were all made alike--plain skirts\nfulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt\nand tight as sleeves could be.\n\"I'll imagine that I like them,\" said Anne soberly.\n\"I don't want you to imagine it,\" said Marilla, offended. \"Oh, I can see\nyou don't like the dresses! What is the matter with them? Aren't they\nneat and clean and new?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then why don't you like them?\"\n\"They're--they're not--pretty,\" said Anne reluctantly.\n\"Pretty!\" Marilla sniffed. \"I didn't trouble my head about getting\npretty dresses for you. I don't believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I'll\ntell you that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable\ndresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they're all\nyou'll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do\nyou for school when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and Sunday\nschool. I'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear\nthem. I should think you'd be grateful to get most anything after those\nskimpy wincey things you've been wearing.\"\n\"Oh, I _am_ grateful,\" protested Anne. \"But I'd be ever so much\ngratefuller if--if you'd made just one of them with puffed sleeves.\nPuffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill,\nMarilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.\"\n\"Well, you'll have to do without your thrill. I hadn't any material\nto waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things\nanyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones.\"\n\"But I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and\nsensible all by myself,\" persisted Anne mournfully.\n\"Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your\ncloset, and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson. I got\na quarterly from Mr. Bell for you and you'll go to Sunday school\ntomorrow,\" said Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon.",

Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane,\nso Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.\n\"I didn't like it a bit. It was horrid.\"\n\"Anne Shirley!\" said Marilla rebukingly.\nAnne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny's\nleaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.\n\"They might have been lonesome while I was away,\" she explained. \"And\nnow about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs.\nLynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with\na lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the\nwindow while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully\nlong prayer. I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through\nif I hadn't been sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the\nLake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts\nof splendid things.\"\n\"You shouldn't have done anything of the sort. You should have listened\nto Mr. Bell.\"\n\"But he wasn't talking to me,\" protested Anne. \"He was talking to God\nand he didn't seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. I think\nhe thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of white\nbirches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through\nthem, 'way, 'way down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a\nbeautiful dream! It gave me a thrill and I just said, 'Thank you for it,\nGod,' two or three times.\"\n\"Not out loud, I hope,\" said Marilla anxiously.\n\"Oh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last\nand they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson's class.\nThere were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried\nto imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn't. Why couldn't I? It was\nas easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in\nthe east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had\nreally truly puffs.\"\n\"You shouldn't have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school.\nYou should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it.\"\n\"Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so\nmany. I don't think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were\nlots I wanted to ask her, but I didn't like to because I didn't think\nshe was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a\nparaphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn't, but I could\nrecite, 'The Dog at His Master's Grave' if she liked. That's in the\nThird Royal Reader. It isn't a really truly religious piece of poetry,\nbut it's so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it\nwouldn't do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next\nSunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it's splendid. There are\ntwo lines in particular that just thrill me.\n\"'Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell\nIn Midian's evil day.'\n\"I don't know what 'squadrons' means nor 'Midian,' either, but it sounds\n_so_ tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it.\nI'll practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss\nRogerson--because Mrs. Lynde was too far away--to show me your pew.\nI sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third\nchapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text. If I was a\nminister I'd pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long,\ntoo. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didn't think\nhe was a bit interesting. The trouble with him seems to be that he\nhasn't enough imagination. I didn't listen to him very much. I just let\nmy thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things.\"\nMarilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but\nshe was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things Anne had\nsaid, especially about the minister's sermons and Mr. Bell's prayers,\nwere what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for\nyears, but had never given expression to. It almost seemed to her that\nthose secret, unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible\nand accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of\nneglected humanity.",

What on earth put you\nup to such a caper? A pretty-looking object you must have been!\"\n\"Oh. I know pink and yellow aren't becoming to me,\" began Anne.\n\"Becoming fiddlesticks! It was putting flowers on your hat at all,\nno matter what color they were, that was ridiculous. You are the most\naggravating child!\"\n\"I don't see why it's any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat\nthan on your dress,\" protested Anne. \"Lots of little girls there had\nbouquets pinned on their dresses. What's the difference?\"\nMarilla was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of\nthe abstract.\n\"Don't answer me back like that, Anne. It was very silly of you to do\nsuch a thing. Never let me catch you at such a trick again. Mrs. Rachel\nsays she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come\nin all rigged out like that. She couldn't get near enough to tell you\nto take them off till it was too late. She says people talked about it\nsomething dreadful. Of course they would think I had no better sense\nthan to let you go decked out like that.\"\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" said Anne, tears welling into her eyes. \"I never\nthought you'd mind. The roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty\nI thought they'd look lovely on my hat. Lots of the little girls had\nartificial flowers on their hats. I'm afraid I'm going to be a dreadful\ntrial to you. Maybe you'd better send me back to the asylum. That would\nbe terrible; I don't think I could endure it; most likely I would go\ninto consumption; I'm so thin as it is, you see. But that would be\nbetter than being a trial to you.\"",

Diana is going to teach me to\nsing a song called 'Nelly in the Hazel Dell.' She's going to give me a\npicture to put up in my room; it's a perfectly beautiful picture, she\nsays--a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress. A sewing-machine agent\ngave it to her. I wish I had something to give Diana. I'm an inch taller\nthan Diana, but she is ever so much fatter; she says she'd like to be\nthin because it's so much more graceful, but I'm afraid she only said\nit to soothe my feelings. We're going to the shore some day to gather\nshells. We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the\nDryad's Bubble. Isn't that a perfectly elegant name? I read a story\nonce about a spring called that.

I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came\nhome from church yesterday evening, but I can't find it anywhere.\"\n\"I--I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society,\" said\nAnne, a little slowly. \"I was passing your door when I saw it on the\ncushion, so I went in to look at it.\"\n\"Did you touch it?\" said Marilla sternly.\n\"Y-e-e-s,\" admitted Anne, \"I took it up and I pinned it on my breast\njust to see how it would look.\"\n\"You had no business to do anything of the sort. It's very wrong in a\nlittle girl to meddle. You shouldn't have gone into my room in the first\nplace and you shouldn't have touched a brooch that didn't belong to you\nin the second. Where did you put it?\"\n\"Oh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn't it on a minute. Truly, I\ndidn't mean to meddle, Marilla. I didn't think about its being wrong to\ngo in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I'll never\ndo it again. That's one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty\nthing twice.\"\n\"You didn't put it back,\" said Marilla. \"That brooch isn't anywhere on\nthe bureau. You've taken it out or something, Anne.\"\n\"I did put it back,\" said Anne quickly--pertly, Marilla thought. \"I\ndon't just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in\nthe china tray. But I'm perfectly certain I put it back.\"\n\"I'll go and have another look,\" said Marilla, determining to be just.\n\"If you put that brooch back it's there still.

And it isn't half severe enough either for what\nyou've done!\"\n\"Not go to the picnic!\" Anne sprang to her feet and clutched Marilla's\nhand. \"But you _promised_ me I might! Oh, Marilla, I must go to the\npicnic. That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that.\nOh, Marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice\ncream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice\ncream again.\"\nMarilla disengaged Anne's clinging hands stonily.\n\"You needn't plead, Anne. You are not going to the picnic and that's\nfinal. No, not a word.\"\nAnne realized that Marilla was not to be moved. She clasped her hands\ntogether, gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face\ndownward on the bed, crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of\ndisappointment and despair.\n\"For the land's sake!\" gasped Marilla, hastening from the room. \"I\nbelieve the child is crazy. No child in her senses would behave as she\ndoes. If she isn't she's utterly bad. Oh dear, I'm afraid Rachel was\nright from the first. But I've put my hand to the plow and I won't look",

Don't you think it's pretty rough not to let her go to the\npicnic when she's so set on it?\"\n\"Matthew Cuthbert, I'm amazed at you. I think I've let her off entirely\ntoo easy. And she doesn't appear to realize how wicked she's been at\nall--that's what worries me most. If she'd really felt sorry it wouldn't\nbe so bad. And you don't seem to realize it, neither; you're making\nexcuses for her all the time to yourself--I can see that.\"\n\"Well now, she's such a little thing,\" feebly reiterated Matthew. \"And\nthere should be allowances made, Marilla. You know she's never had any\nbringing up.\"\n\"Well, she's having it now\" retorted Marilla.\nThe retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him. That dinner was\na very dismal meal.

Anne thought\nthose walks to and from school with Diana couldn't be improved upon\neven by imagination. Going around by the main road would have been so\nunromantic; but to go by Lover's Lane and Willowmere and Violet Vale and\nthe Birch Path was romantic, if ever anything was.",

So we want to have one, too. And it's a very pretty\nname, don't you think? So romantic! We can't imagine the lovers into it,\nyou know. I like that lane because you can think out loud there without\npeople calling you crazy.\"\nAnne, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover's Lane as far\nas the brook. Here Diana met her, and the two little girls went on\nup the lane under the leafy arch of maples--\"maples are such sociable\ntrees,\" said Anne; \"they're always rustling and whispering to\nyou\"--until they came to a rustic bridge. Then they left the lane\nand walked through Mr. Barry's back field and past Willowmere. Beyond\nWillowmere came Violet Vale--a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr.\nAndrew Bell's big woods. \"Of course there are no violets there now,\"\nAnne told Marilla, \"but Diana says there are millions of them in spring.\nOh, Marilla, can't you just imagine you see them? It actually takes away\nmy breath. I named it Violet Vale. Diana says she never saw the beat\nof me for hitting on fancy names for places. It's nice to be clever at\nsomething, isn't it? But Diana named the Birch Path. She wanted to, so\nI let her; but I'm sure I could have found something more poetical than\nplain Birch Path. Anybody can think of a name like that.

            "text": "But it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.\nMr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to\nPrissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as\nthey pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their\nslates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.\nGilbert Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him and failing\nutterly, because Anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only\nto the very existence of Gilbert Blythe, but of every other scholar in\nAvonlea school itself. With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes\nfixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west\nwindow afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and\nseeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.\nGilbert Blythe wasn't used to putting himself out to make a girl look\nat him and meeting with failure. She _should_ look at him, that red-haired\nShirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren't\nlike the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.\nGilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne's long red\nbraid, held it out at arm's length and said in a piercing whisper:\n\"Carrots! Carrots!\"\nThen Anne looked at him with a vengeance!\nShe did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies\nfallen into cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert\nfrom eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry\ntears.\n\"You mean, hateful boy!\" she exclaimed passionately. \"How dare you!\"\nAnd then--thwack! Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert's head and\ncracked it--slate not head--clear across.\nAvonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable\none. Everybody said \"Oh\" in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby\nGillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Tommy\nSloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared\nopen-mouthed at the tableau.\nMr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Anne's\nshoulder.\n\"Anne Shirley, what does this mean?\" he said angrily. Anne returned no\nanswer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell\nbefore the whole school that she had been called \"carrots.\" Gilbert it\nwas who spoke up stoutly.\n\"It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her.\"\nMr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.\n\"I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such\na vindictive spirit,\" he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of\nbeing a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts\nof small imperfect mortals. \"Anne, go and stand on the platform in front\nof the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.\"\nAnne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under\nwhich her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white,\nset face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the\nblackboard above her head.\n\"Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control\nher temper,\" and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,\nwho couldn't read writing, should understand it.\nAnne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.\nShe did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart\nfor that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With\nresentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana's\nsympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane's indignant nods and Josie Pye's\nmalicious smiles. As for Gilbert Blythe, she would not even look at him.\nShe would _never_ look at him again! She would never speak to him!!",

I've been insulted.\"\n\"Insulted fiddlesticks! You'll go to school tomorrow as usual.\"\n\"Oh, no.\" Anne shook her head gently. \"I'm not going back, Marilla.

She's too worked up and I've\nan idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion. Far as I can\nmake out from her story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a\nrather high hand. But it would never do to say so to her. I'll just talk\nit over with Rachel. She's sent ten children to school and she ought to\nknow something about it. She'll have heard the whole story, too, by this\ntime.\"\nMarilla found Mrs. Lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully\nas usual.\n\"I suppose you know what I've come about,\" she said, a little\nshamefacedly.\nMrs. Rachel nodded.\n\"About Anne's fuss in school, I reckon,\" she said. \"Tillie Boulter was\nin on her way home from school and told me about it.\"\n\"I don't know what to do with her,\" said Marilla. \"She declares she\nwon't go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I've been\nexpecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were\ngoing too smooth to last. She's so high strung. What would you advise,\nRachel?\"\n\"Well, since you've asked my advice, Marilla,\" said Mrs. Lynde\namiably--Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--\"I'd just\nhumor her a little at first, that's what I'd do. It's my belief that\nMr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn't do to say so to the\nchildren, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday\nfor giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who\nwere late should have been punished as well as Anne, that's what. And I\ndon't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It\nisn't modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne's part\nright through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular\namong them, somehow. I never thought she'd take with them so well.\"\n\"Then you really think I'd better let her stay home,\" said Marilla in\namazement.\n\"Yes. That is I wouldn't say school to her again until she said it\nherself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she'll cool off in a week or so and\nbe ready enough to go back of her own accord, that's what, while, if\nyou were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum\nshe'd take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the\nbetter, in my opinion. She won't miss much by not going to school, as\nfar as _that_ goes. Mr. Phillips isn't any good at all as a teacher. The\norder he keeps is scandalous, that's what, and he neglects the young\nfry and puts all his time on those big scholars he's getting ready for\nQueen's. He'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle\nhadn't been a trustee--_the_ trustee, for he just leads the other two\naround by the nose, that's what. I declare, I don't know what education\nin this Island is coming to.\"\nMrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the\nhead of the educational system of the Province things would be much\nbetter managed.\nMarilla took Mrs. Rachel's advice and not another word was said to Anne",

I'm going on a\nmeeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon, Anne, and I won't\nlikely be home before dark.

Matthew was so good. He never scolded a bit.\nHe put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as\nnot. And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so\nhe didn't find the time long at all. It was a beautiful fairy story,\nMarilla. I forgot the end of it, so I made up an end for it myself and\nMatthew said he couldn't tell where the join came in.\"\n\"Matthew would think it all right, Anne, if you took a notion to get up\nand have dinner in the middle of the night. But you keep your wits about\nyou this time. And--I don't really know if I'm doing right--it may make\nyou more addlepated than ever--but you can ask Diana to come over and\nspend the afternoon with you and have tea here.\"\n\"Oh, Marilla!\" Anne clasped her hands. \"How perfectly lovely! You _are_\nable to imagine things after all or else you'd never have understood how\nI've longed for that very thing. It will seem so nice and grown-uppish.\nNo fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company. Oh,\nMarilla, can I use the rosebud spray tea set?\"\n\"No, indeed! The rosebud tea set! Well, what next? You know I never use\nthat except for the minister or the Aids. You'll put down the old brown\ntea set. But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves.",

Into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face\ndownward on the sofa in an agony.\n\"Whatever has gone wrong now, Anne?\" queried Marilla in doubt and\ndismay. \"I do hope you haven't gone and been saucy to Mrs. Lynde again.\"\nNo answer from Anne save more tears and stormier sobs!\n\"Anne Shirley, when I ask you a question I want to be answered. Sit\nright up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.\"\nAnne sat up, tragedy personified.\n\"Mrs. Lynde was up to see Mrs. Barry today and Mrs. Barry was in an\nawful state,\" she wailed. \"She says that I set Diana _drunk_ Saturday\nand sent her home in a disgraceful condition. And she says I must be a\nthoroughly bad, wicked little girl and she's never, never going to let\nDiana play with me again. Oh, Marilla, I'm just overcome with woe.\"\nMarilla stared in blank amazement.\n\"Set Diana drunk!\" she said when she found her voice. \"Anne are you or\nMrs. Barry crazy? What on earth did you give her?\"\n\"Not a thing but raspberry cordial,\" sobbed Anne. \"I never thought\nraspberry cordial would set people drunk, Marilla--not even if they\ndrank three big tumblerfuls as Diana did. Oh, it sounds so--so--like\nMrs. Thomas's husband! But I didn't mean to set her drunk.\"\n\"Drunk fiddlesticks!\" said Marilla, marching to the sitting room pantry.\nThere on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one\ncontaining some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which\nshe was celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort,\nMrs. Barry among them, disapproved strongly of it. And at the same time\nMarilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial\ndown in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told Anne.\nShe went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand. Her face\nwas twitching in spite of herself.\n\"Anne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble. You went\nand gave Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial. Didn't you\nknow the difference yourself?\"\n\"I never tasted it,\" said Anne. \"I thought it was the cordial. I meant\nto be so--so--hospitable. Diana got awfully sick and had to go home.\nMrs. Barry told Mrs. Lynde she was simply dead drunk. She just laughed\nsilly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to\nsleep and slept for hours. Her mother smelled her breath and knew she\nwas drunk. She had a fearful headache all day yesterday. Mrs. Barry is\nso indignant. She will never believe but what I did it on purpose.\"\n\"I should think she would better punish Diana for being so greedy as to\ndrink three glassfuls of anything,\" said Marilla shortly. \"Why, three\nof those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been\ncordial. Well, this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are\nso down on me for making currant wine, although I haven't made any for\nthree years ever since I found out that the minister didn't approve. I\njust kept that bottle for sickness. There, there, child, don't cry. I\ncan't see as you were to blame although I'm sorry it happened so.\"\n\"I must cry,\" said Anne. \"My heart is broken. The stars in their courses\nfight against me, Marilla. Diana and I are parted forever. Oh, Marilla,\nI little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship.\"\n\"Don't be foolish, Anne. Mrs. Barry will think better of it when she\nfinds you're not to blame. I suppose she thinks you've done it for a\nsilly joke or something of that sort. You'd best go up this evening and",

But the hope faded when she saw Diana's dejected\ncountenance.\n\"Your mother hasn't relented?\" she gasped.\nDiana shook her head mournfully.\n\"No; and oh, Anne, she says I'm never to play with you again. I've cried\nand cried and I told her it wasn't your fault, but it wasn't any use. I\nhad ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to\nyou. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she's timing me by the\nclock.\"\n\"Ten minutes isn't very long to say an eternal farewell in,\" said Anne\ntearfully. \"Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget\nme, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress\nthee?\"\n\"Indeed I will,\" sobbed Diana, \"and I'll never have another bosom\nfriend--I don't want to have. I couldn't love anybody as I love you.\"\n\"Oh, Diana,\" cried Anne, clasping her hands, \"do you _love_ me?\"\n\"Why, of course I do. Didn't you know that?\"\n\"No.\" Anne drew a long breath. \"I thought you _liked_ me of course but I\nnever hoped you _loved_ me. Why, Diana, I didn't think anybody could\nlove me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is\nwonderful! It's a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness\nof a path severed from thee, Diana. Oh, just say it once again.\"\n\"I love you devotedly, Anne,\" said Diana stanchly, \"and I always will,\nyou may be sure of that.\"\n\"And I will always love thee, Diana,\" said Anne, solemnly extending her\nhand. \"In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my\nlonely life, as that last story we read together says. Diana, wilt\nthou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure\nforevermore?\"\n\"Have you got anything to cut it with?\" queried Diana, wiping away the\ntears which Anne's affecting accents had caused to flow afresh, and\nreturning to practicalities.\n\"Yes. I've got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately,\"\nsaid Anne. She solemnly clipped one of Diana's curls. \"Fare thee well,\nmy beloved friend. Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side\nby side.

            "text": "Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely\nat the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green\nGables all to themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned\nWaterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the\nwindowpanes. Matthew nodded over a _Farmers' Advocate_ on the sofa and\nAnne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite\nsundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that\nJane Andrews had lent her that day. Jane had assured her that it was\nwarranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and\nAnne's fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that would mean Gilbert\nBlythe's triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her back on the clock shelf\nand tried to imagine it wasn't there.\n\"Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?\"\n\"Well now, no, I didn't,\" said Matthew, coming out of his doze with a\nstart.\n\"I wish you had,\" sighed Anne, \"because then you'd be able to sympathize\nwith me. You can't sympathize properly if you've never studied it. It is\ncasting a cloud over my whole life. I'm such a dunce at it, Matthew.\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew soothingly. \"I guess you're all right\nat anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair's store at Carmody\nthat you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid\nprogress. 'Rapid progress' was his very words. There's them as runs down\nTeddy Phillips and says he ain't much of a teacher, but I guess he's all\nright.\"\nMatthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was \"all right.\"\n\"I'm sure I'd get on better with geometry if only he wouldn't change\nthe letters,\" complained Anne. \"I learn the proposition off by heart and\nthen he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what\nare in the book and I get all mixed up. I don't think a teacher should\ntake such a mean advantage, do you? We're studying agriculture now and\nI've found out at last what makes the roads red. It's a great comfort.\nI wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde\nsays Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa\nand that it's an awful warning to the electors. She says if women were\nallowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change. What way do you\nvote, Matthew?\"\n\"Conservative,\" said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was part of\nMatthew's religion.\n\"Then I'm Conservative too,\" said Anne decidedly. \"I'm glad because\nGil--because some of the boys in school are Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips\nis a Grit too because Prissy Andrews's father is one, and Ruby Gillis\nsays that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl's\nmother in religion and her father in politics. Is that true, Matthew?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Did you ever go courting, Matthew?\"\n\"Well now, no, I dunno's I ever did,\" said Matthew, who had certainly\nnever thought of such a thing in his whole existence.\nAnne reflected with her chin in her hands.\n\"It must be rather interesting, don't you think, Matthew? Ruby Gillis\nsays when she grows up she's going to have ever so many beaus on the\nstring and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too\nexciting. I'd rather have just one in his right mind. But Ruby Gillis\nknows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big\nsisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot\ncakes. Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening.\nHe says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is\nstudying for Queen's too, and I should think she needed help a lot more\nthan Prissy because she's ever so much stupider, but he never goes to\nhelp her in the evenings at all. There are a great many things in this\nworld that I can't understand very well, Matthew.\"\n\"Well now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,\" acknowledged\nMatthew.\n\"Well, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I won't allow myself to\nopen that new book Jane lent me until I'm through. But it's a terrible\ntemptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there\njust as plain. Jane said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book\nthat makes me cry. But I think I'll carry that book into the sitting\nroom and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must\n_not_ give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if\nI implore you on my bended knees. It's all very well to say resist\ntemptation, but it's ever so much easier to resist it if you can't get\nthe key. And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets,\nMatthew? Wouldn't you like some russets?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno but what I would,\" said Matthew, who never ate\nrussets but knew Anne's weakness for them.",

Anne thought it was truly delightful to go\nskimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend\nwho had been so long estranged.\nMinnie May, aged three, was really very sick. She lay on the kitchen\nsofa feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard\nall over the house. Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl\nfrom the creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children\nduring her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of\nthinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.\nAnne went to work with skill and promptness.\n\"Minnie May has croup all right; she's pretty bad, but I've seen them\nworse. First we must have lots of hot water. I declare, Diana, there\nisn't more than a cupful in the kettle! There, I've filled it up, and,\nMary Joe, you may put some wood in the stove. I don't want to hurt your\nfeelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if\nyou'd any imagination. Now, I'll undress Minnie May and put her to bed\nand you try to find some soft flannel cloths, Diana. I'm going to give\nher a dose of ipecac first of all.\"\nMinnie May did not take kindly to the ipecac but Anne had not brought up\nthree pairs of twins for nothing. Down that ipecac went, not only once,\nbut many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls\nworked patiently over the suffering Minnie May, and Young Mary Joe,\nhonestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated\nmore water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.\nIt was three o'clock when Matthew came with a doctor, for he had been\nobliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one. But the pressing need\nfor assistance was past. Minnie May was much better and was sleeping",

I must say it was\nfortunate you knew what to do. I wouldn't have had any idea myself, for\nI never saw a case of croup. There now, never mind talking till you've\nhad your dinner. I can tell by the look of you that you're just full up\nwith speeches, but they'll keep.\"\nMarilla had something to tell Anne, but she did not tell it just then\nfor she knew if she did Anne's consequent excitement would lift her\nclear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner.",

She\nsays she knows now you didn't mean to set Diana drunk, and she hopes\nyou'll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again. You're to go\nover this evening if you like for Diana can't stir outside the door\non account of a bad cold she caught last night. Now, Anne Shirley, for\npity's sake don't fly up into the air.\"\nThe warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was Anne's\nexpression and attitude as she sprang to her feet, her face irradiated\nwith the flame of her spirit.\n\"Oh, Marilla, can I go right now--without washing my dishes? I'll wash\nthem when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so\nunromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.\"\n\"Yes, yes, run along,\" said Marilla indulgently. \"Anne Shirley--are you\ncrazy? Come back this instant and put something on you. I might as well\ncall to the wind. She's gone without a cap or wrap. Look at her tearing\nthrough the orchard with her hair streaming. It'll be a mercy if she\ndoesn't catch her death of cold.\"\nAnne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy\nplaces. Afar in the southwest was the great shimmering, pearl-like\nsparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal\nrose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce. The tinkles\nof sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through\nthe frosty air, but their music was not sweeter than the song in Anne's\nheart and on her lips.\n\"You see before you a perfectly happy person, Marilla,\" she announced.\n\"I'm perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair. Just at present I\nhave a soul above red hair. Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried and said she\nwas so sorry and she could never repay me. I felt fearfully embarrassed,\nMarilla, but I just said as politely as I could, 'I have no hard\nfeelings for you, Mrs. Barry. I assure you once for all that I did not\nmean to intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the\nmantle of oblivion.' That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn't\nit, Marilla?\"\n\"I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry's head. And Diana\nand I had a lovely afternoon. Diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch\nher aunt over at Carmody taught her. Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but\nus, and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else. Diana\ngave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of\npoetry:\"\n\"If you love me as I love you\nNothing but death can part us two.\"\n\"And that is true, Marilla. We're going to ask Mr. Phillips to let us\nsit together in school again, and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews.\nWe had an elegant tea. Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out,\nMarilla, just as if I was real company. I can't tell you what a thrill\nit gave me. Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before.\nAnd we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of\npreserves, Marilla. And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said 'Pa,\nwhy don't you pass the biscuits to Anne?' It must be lovely to be grown\nup, Marilla, when just being treated as if you were is so nice.\"\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Marilla, with a brief sigh.\n\"Well, anyway, when I am grown up,\" said Anne decidedly, \"I'm always\ngoing to talk to little girls as if they were too, and I'll never laugh\nwhen they use big words. I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts\none's feelings. After tea Diana and I made taffy. The taffy wasn't very\ngood, I suppose because neither Diana nor I had ever made any before.\nDiana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and\nlet it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat\nwalked over one plate and that had to be thrown away. But the making of\nit was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come\nover as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses\nto me all the way down to Lover's Lane. I assure you, Marilla, that I\nfeel like praying tonight and I'm going to think out a special brand-new\nprayer in honor of the occasion.\"",

But I don't approve of this\nconcert plan. She'd go there and catch cold like as not, and have her\nhead filled up with nonsense and excitement. It would unsettle her for\na week. I understand that child's disposition and what's good for it\nbetter than you, Matthew.\"\n\"I think you ought to let Anne go,\" repeated Matthew firmly. Argument\nwas not his strong point, but holding fast to his opinion certainly was.\nMarilla gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence. The\nnext morning, when Anne was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry,\nMatthew paused on his way out to the barn to say to Marilla again:\n\"I think you ought to let Anne go, Marilla.\"\nFor a moment Marilla looked things not lawful to be uttered. Then she\nyielded to the inevitable and said tartly:\n\"Very well, she can go, since nothing else 'll please you.\"\nAnne flew out of the pantry, dripping dishcloth in hand.\n\"Oh, Marilla, Marilla, say those blessed words again.\"\n\"I guess once is enough to say them.

The two little white-clad figures flew\ndown the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed\nat the same moment. And then--something--moved beneath them, there was a\ngasp and a cry--and somebody said in muffled accents:\n\"Merciful goodness!\"\nAnne and Diana were never able to tell just how they got off that bed\nand out of the room. They only knew that after one frantic rush they\nfound themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs.\n\"Oh, who was it--_what_ was it?\" whispered Anne, her teeth chattering with\ncold and fright.\n\"It was Aunt Josephine,\" said Diana, gasping with laughter. \"Oh, Anne,\nit was Aunt Josephine, however she came to be there. Oh, and I know she\nwill be furious. It's dreadful--it's really dreadful--but did you ever\nknow anything so funny, Anne?\"\n\"Who is your Aunt Josephine?\"\n\"She's father's aunt and she lives in Charlottetown. She's awfully\nold--seventy anyhow--and I don't believe she was _ever_ a little girl. We\nwere expecting her out for a visit, but not so soon.

I\nhope you didn't disturb your aunt, Diana.\"\nDiana preserved a discreet silence, but she and Anne exchanged furtive\nsmiles of guilty amusement across the table. Anne hurried home after\nbreakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which\npresently resulted in the Barry household until the late afternoon, when\nshe went down to Mrs. Lynde's on an errand for Marilla.\n\"So you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last\nnight?\" said Mrs. Lynde severely, but with a twinkle in her eye. \"Mrs.\nBarry was here a few minutes ago on her way to Carmody. She's feeling\nreal worried over it. Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she\ngot up this morning--and Josephine Barry's temper is no joke, I can tell\nyou that.

Well, it's made a nice lot of\ntrouble, that's what.

Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. The\nBarrys must feel cut up. Old Miss Barry is rich and they'd like to keep\non the good side of her. Of course, Mrs. Barry didn't say just that to\nme, but I'm a pretty good judge of human nature, that's what.\"\n\"I'm such an unlucky girl,\" mourned Anne. \"I'm always getting into\nscrapes myself and getting my best friends--people I'd shed my heart's\nblood for--into them too.

She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see\nDiana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up\nwith a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.\n\"Who are you?\" demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.\n\"I'm Anne of Green Gables,\" said the small visitor tremulously, clasping\nher hands with her characteristic gesture, \"and I've come to confess, if\nyou please.\"\n\"Confess what?\"\n\"That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I\nsuggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure.\nDiana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it\nis to blame her.\"\n\"Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at\nleast. Such carryings on in a respectable house!\"\n\"But we were only in fun,\" persisted Anne. \"I think you ought to forgive\nus, Miss Barry, now that we've apologized. And anyhow, please forgive\nDiana and let her have her music lessons. Diana's heart is set on her\nmusic lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your\nheart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be\ncross with me. I've been so used in my early days to having people cross\nat me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.\"\nMuch of the snap had gone out of the old lady's eyes by this time\nand was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she still said\nseverely:\n\"I don't think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.\nLittle girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young. You\ndon't know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long\nand arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.\"\n\"I don't _know_, but I can _imagine_,\" said Anne eagerly. \"I'm sure it must\nhave been very disturbing. But then, there is our side of it too. Have\nyou any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have, just put yourself in\nour place. We didn't know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly\nscared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we\ncouldn't sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are\nused to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel\nlike if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.\"\nAll the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed--a\nsound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen\noutside, to give a great gasp of relief.\n\"I'm afraid my imagination is a little rusty--it's so long since I used\nit,\" she said. \"I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as\nmine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell me\nabout yourself.\"\n\"I am very sorry I can't,\" said Anne firmly. \"I would like to, because\nyou seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred\nspirit although you don't look very much like it. But it is my duty to\ngo home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind\nlady who has taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but\nit is very discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on\nthe bed. But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive\nDiana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.\"\n\"I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me\noccasionally,\" said Miss Barry.\nThat evening Miss Barry gave Diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the\nsenior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.\n\"I've made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better\nacquainted with that Anne-girl,\" she said frankly. \"She amuses me, and\nat my time of life an amusing person is a rarity.\"",

The maples in Lover's Lane were red budded\nand little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad's Bubble. Away up in\nthe barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane's place, the Mayflowers blossomed\nout, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the\nschool girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming\nhome in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of\nflowery spoil.\n\"I'm so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no\nMayflowers,\" said Anne. \"Diana says perhaps they have something better,\nbut there couldn't be anything better than Mayflowers, could there,\nMarilla? And Diana says if they don't know what they are like they don't\nmiss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it\nwould be _tragic_, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and _not_\nto miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think\nthey must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this\nis their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our\nlunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.\nCharlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because\nhe wouldn't take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very _fashionable_\nto dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews\nand I heard him to say 'sweets to the sweet.' He got that out of a\nbook, I know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered some\nMayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can't tell you the\nperson's name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We\nmade wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the\ntime came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two,\nwith our bouquets and wreaths, singing 'My Home on the Hill.' Oh, it was\nso thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane's folks rushed out to see us\nand everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a\nreal sensation.\"",

The\nwalls were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly\nand yellowly upright as ever. Yet the whole character of the room was\naltered. It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to\npervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses\nand ribbons, and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms\non the table. It was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its\nvivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had\ntapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and\nmoonshine. Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of Anne's freshly\nironed school aprons. She hung them over a chair and sat down with\na short sigh. She had had one of her headaches that afternoon, and\nalthough the pain had gone she felt weak and \"tuckered out,\" as she\nexpressed it. Anne looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy.",

Who\nhas been telling you such stuff?\"\n\"Nobody,\" confessed Anne. \"Diana and I just imagined the wood was\nhaunted. All the places around here are so--so--_commonplace_. We just got\nthis up for our own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is\nso very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it's so\ngloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There's a white\nlady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings\nher hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when there is to be a\ndeath in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the\ncorner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers\non your hand--so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And\nthere's a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower\nat you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldn't go through the\nHaunted Wood after dark now for anything. I'd be sure that white things\nwould reach out from behind the trees and grab me.\"\n\"Did ever anyone hear the like!\" ejaculated Marilla, who had\nlistened in dumb amazement. \"Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you\nbelieve all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?\"\n\"Not believe _exactly_,\" faltered Anne. \"At least, I don't believe it in\ndaylight. But after dark, Marilla, it's different. That is when ghosts\nwalk.\"\n\"There are no such things as ghosts, Anne.\"\n\"Oh, but there are, Marilla,\" cried Anne eagerly. \"I know people who\nhave seen them. And they are respectable people. Charlie Sloane says\nthat his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night\nafter he'd been buried for a year. You know Charlie Sloane's grandmother\nwouldn't tell a story for anything. She's a very religious woman. And\nMrs. Thomas's father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with\nits head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. He said he knew it was the\nspirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine\ndays. He didn't, but he died two years after, so you see it was really\ntrue. And Ruby Gillis says--\"\n\"Anne Shirley,\" interrupted Marilla firmly, \"I never want to hear you\ntalking in this fashion again. I've had my doubts about that imagination\nof yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, I\nwon't countenance any such doings. You'll go right over to Barry's, and\nyou'll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to\nyou. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods\nagain.\"\nAnne might plead and cry as she liked--and did, for her terror was very\nreal. Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce\ngrove in mortal dread after nightfall. But Marilla was inexorable. She\nmarched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her\nto proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of\nwailing ladies and headless specters beyond.\n\"Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?\" sobbed Anne. \"What would you\nfeel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?\"\n\"I'll risk it,\" said Marilla unfeelingly. \"You know I always mean what I\nsay. I'll cure you of imagining ghosts into places. March, now.\"",

Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a\nhandkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because\nshe hadn't brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh,\nMarilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful\nfarewell speech beginning, 'The time has come for us to part.' It was\nvery affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt\ndreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I'd talked in school\nand drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy.\nI can tell you I wished I'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews.

For all I was feeling so bad about Mr.\nPhillips going away I couldn't help taking a little interest in a new\nminister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely,\nof course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally\nlovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the\nminister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she\ndresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue\nmuslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.\nJane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for\na minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark,\nMarilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides,\nshe's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should\nmake allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde\nuntil the manse is ready.\"\nIf Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde's that evening, was actuated by\nany motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had\nborrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most\nof the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes\nnever expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the\nborrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife,\nwas a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement\nwhere sensations were few and far between.\nOld Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in\nimagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a\nwidower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that\ngossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year\nof his sojourn. In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and\ndeparted amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection\nborn of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his\nshortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a\nvariety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various\ncandidates and \"supplies\" who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on\ntrial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers\nin Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the\ncorner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and\ndiscussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from\nprinciple to criticize ministers in any shape or form.\n\"I don't think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew\" was Anne's final\nsumming up. \"Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his\nworst fault was just like Mr. Bentley's--he had no imagination. And Mr.\nTerry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in\nthe matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology\nwasn't sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,\nbut he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church;\nhe was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,\nmustn't you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive;\nbut Mrs. Lynde says he isn't married, or even engaged, because she made\nspecial inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have\na young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the\ncongregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing\nwoman, isn't she, Matthew? I'm very glad they've called Mr. Allan. I\nliked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he\nmeant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.\nMrs. Lynde says he isn't perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn't\nexpect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year,\nand anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly\non all the points of doctrine. And she knows his wife's people and they\nare most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde\nsays that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman\nmake an ideal combination for a minister's family.\"\nThe new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still\non their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for\ntheir chosen lifework.

She said right away\nshe didn't think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions,\nand you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I've always thought. She\nsaid we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many.\nI'm good at asking questions, Marilla.\"\n\"I believe you,\" was Marilla's emphatic comment.\n\"Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was\nto be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn't think that was a\nvery proper question to ask because it hadn't any connection with the\nlesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions' den--but Mrs. Allan\njust smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a\nlovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had\ndimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I'm not half so skinny as I was when I\ncame here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence\npeople for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence\nother people for good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew\nbefore that religion was such a cheerful thing. I always thought it\nwas kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan's isn't, and I'd like to be a\nChristian if I could be one like her. I wouldn't want to be one like Mr.\nSuperintendent Bell.\"\n\"It's very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,\" said Marilla\nseverely. \"Mr. Bell is a real good man.\"\n\"Oh, of course he's good,\" agreed Anne, \"but he doesn't seem to get any\ncomfort out of it. If I could be good I'd dance and sing all day because\nI was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and\nof course it wouldn't be dignified in a minister's wife. But I can just\nfeel she's glad she's a Christian and that she'd be one even if she\ncould get to heaven without it.\"\n\"I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,\" said\nMarilla reflectively. \"They've been most everywhere but here. Let me\nsee. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don't say a\nword to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he'd find some\nexcuse to be away that day. He'd got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn't\nmind him, but he's going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new\nminister, and a new minister's wife will frighten him to death.\"\n\"I'll be as secret as the dead,\" assured Anne. \"But oh, Marilla, will\nyou let me make a cake for the occasion? I'd love to do something for\nMrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.\"\n\"You can make a layer cake,\" promised Marilla.\nMonday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables.\nHaving the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important\nundertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of\nthe Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She\ntalked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they\nsat on the big red stones by the Dryad's Bubble and made rainbows in the\nwater with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.\n\"Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I'm to make in the\nmorning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just\nbefore teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy\ntwo days of it. It's such a responsibility having a minister's family to\ntea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see\nour pantry. It's a sight to behold. We're going to have jellied chicken\nand cold tongue. We're to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and\nwhipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies,\nand fruit cake, and Marilla's famous yellow plum preserves that she\nkeeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and\nbiscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister",

She had come\ndancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow\nsunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening.\n\"No, Marilla, but oh, what do you think? I am invited to tea at the\nmanse tomorrow afternoon! Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post\noffice. Just look at it, Marilla.

All\n\"spirit and fire and dew,\" as she was, the pleasures and pains of life\ncame to her with trebled intensity. Marilla felt this and was vaguely\ntroubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would\nprobably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently\nunderstanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more\nthan compensate. Therefore Marilla conceived it to be her duty to drill\nAnne into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien\nto her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows. She did not\nmake much headway, as she sorrowfully admitted to herself. The downfall\nof some dear hope or plan plunged Anne into \"deeps of affliction.\" The\nfulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight. Marilla had\nalmost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into\nher model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment.

            "text": "high-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in\na beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting\non the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly\nhead in Marilla's gingham lap.\nA cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims\nof firry western hills and whistling through the poplars. One clear star\nhung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover's\nLane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them\nas she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were\nall tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.\n\"Oh, Marilla, I've had a most _fascinating_ time. I feel that I have not\nlived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never\nbe invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me\nat the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy,\nwith dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a\nseraph. I really think I'd like to be a minister's wife when I grow up,\nMarilla. A minister mightn't mind my red hair because he wouldn't be\nthinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to\nbe naturally good and I'll never be that, so I suppose there's no use in\nthinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others\nare not. I'm one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I'm full of original\nsin. No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success\nof it as those who are naturally good. It's a good deal like geometry,\nI expect. But don't you think the trying so hard ought to count for\nsomething? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her\npassionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs.\nAllan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are\nothers, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You\nknow you _ought_ to love them because they know so much and are such\nactive workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of\nit all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the\nmanse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her name was Laurette\nBradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred\nspirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I\nthink I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs.\nAllan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too.\nMrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the\nSunday-school choir after this. You can't think how I was thrilled at\nthe mere thought. I've longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir,\nas Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to.\nLauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the\nWhite Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta\nsays that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in\naid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White\nSands people to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself\nsomeday. I just gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I\nhad a heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything--about Mrs. Thomas and\nthe twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and\nmy troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs.\nAllan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don't know how that\nencouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what\ndo you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it's\na lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn't that a romantic name? Mrs.\nLynde says they've never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she\nthinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid\nto have a lady teacher, and I really don't see how I'm going to live\nthrough the two weeks before school begins. I'm so impatient to see\nher.\"",

This presently took the form of \"daring.\"\nDaring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just\nthen. It had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all\nthe silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers\nthereof were \"dared\" to do them would fill a book by themselves.\nFirst of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point\nin the huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis,\nalbeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said\ntree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she\nshould tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the\naforesaid Carrie Sloane. Then Josie Pye dared Jane Andrews to hop on her\nleft leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right\nfoot to the ground; which Jane Andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out\nat the third corner and had to confess herself defeated.\nJosie's triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,\nAnne Shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which\nbounded the garden to the east. Now, to \"walk\" board fences requires\nmore skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who\nhas never tried it. But Josie Pye, if deficient in some qualities\nthat make for popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly\ncultivated, for walking board fences. Josie walked the Barry fence with\nan airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that\nwasn't worth a \"dare.\" Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for\nmost of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things\nthemselves in their efforts to walk fences.

If I\ncould blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But what would\nyou have done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?\"\n\"I'd have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away. Such\nabsurdity!\" said Marilla.\nAnne sighed.\n\"But you have such strength of mind, Marilla. I haven't. I just felt\nthat I couldn't bear Josie Pye's scorn. She would have crowed over me\nall my life. And I think I have been punished so much that you needn't\nbe very cross with me, Marilla. It's not a bit nice to faint, after all.\nAnd the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle. I won't\nbe able to go around for six or seven weeks and I'll miss the new lady\nteacher. She won't be new any more by the time I'm able to go to school.\nAnd Gil--everybody will get ahead of me in class. Oh, I am an afflicted\nmortal. But I'll try to bear it all bravely if only you won't be cross\nwith me, Marilla.\"\n\"There, there, I'm not cross,\" said Marilla. \"You're an unlucky child,\nthere's no doubt about that; but as you say, you'll have the suffering\nof it. Here now, try and eat some supper.\"\n\"Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?\" said Anne. \"It will\nhelp me through splendidly, I expect. What do people who haven't any\nimagination do when they break their bones, do you suppose, Marilla?\"\nAnne had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during\nthe tedious seven weeks that followed. But she was not solely dependent\non it. She had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of\nthe schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her\nall the happenings in the juvenile world of Avonlea.\n\"Everybody has been so good and kind, Marilla,\" sighed Anne happily,\non the day when she could first limp across the floor. \"It isn't very\npleasant to be laid up; but there is a bright side to it, Marilla. You\nfind out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came\nto see me, and he's really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of\ncourse; but still I like him and I'm awfully sorry I ever criticized his\nprayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into\nthe habit of saying them as if he didn't. He could get over that if he'd\ntake a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard\nI tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me\nall about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem\nso strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my\nimagination has its limits, for I can't imagine _that_. When I try to\nimagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just\nas he looks in Sunday school, only small. Now, it's so easy to imagine\nMrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen\ntimes. Isn't that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a minister's\nwife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to\nhave visit you, too. She never tells you it's your own fault and she\nhopes you'll be a better girl on account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told\nme that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that\nmade me feel she might hope I'd be a better girl but didn't really\nbelieve I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her as\npolitely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk\na ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden\nof remorse all her life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She's been\nover every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad\nwhen I can go to school for I've heard such exciting things about the\nnew teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she\nhas the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses\nbeautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else's in\nAvonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody\nhas to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it's just glorious to\nthink of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie\nhas so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are\npreparing a dialogue, called 'A Morning Visit,' for next Friday. And the\nFriday afternoons they don't have recitations Miss Stacy takes them\nall to the woods for a 'field' day and they study ferns and flowers\nand birds. And they have physical culture exercises every morning and\nevening. Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all\ncomes of having a lady teacher. But I think it must be splendid and I\nbelieve I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit.\"\n\"There's one thing plain to be seen, Anne,\" said Marilla, \"and that is",

Of\ncourse it's real nice to be getting up a concert. We're going to have\nsix choruses and Diana is to sing a solo. I'm in two dialogues--'The\nSociety for the Suppression of Gossip' and 'The Fairy Queen.' The boys\nare going to have a dialogue too. And I'm to have two recitations,\nMarilla. I just tremble when I think of it, but it's a nice thrilly kind\nof tremble. And we're to have a tableau at the last--'Faith, Hope and\nCharity.' Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with\nflowing hair. I'm to be Hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes\nuplifted. I'm going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don't be\nalarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one\nof them, and it's really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla.\nJosie Pye is sulky because she didn't get the part she wanted in\nthe dialogue. She wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been\nridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy\nqueens must be slender. Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be\none of her maids of honor. Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is\njust as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie\nsays. I'm to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis\nis going to lend me her slippers because I haven't any of my own. It's\nnecessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You couldn't imagine\na fairy wearing boots, could you? Especially with copper toes? We are\ngoing to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with\npink tissue-paper roses in them. And we are all to march in two by two\nafter the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the\norgan. Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am,\nbut don't you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?\"",

And what worried Matthew was that the difference\nimpressed him as being something that should not exist. Anne had a\nbrighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more delicate features\nthan the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to take note\nof these things; but the difference that disturbed him did not consist\nin any of these respects.

To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to\nWilliam Blair's; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them\nas to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William\nBlair's two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew\nheld them in absolute dread.

It had been a very\nmild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but\njust enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne\npeeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs\nin the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches\nand wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were\nstretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that\nwas glorious. Anne ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed\nthrough Green Gables.\n\"Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn't it a lovely\nChristmas? I'm so glad it's white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn't\nseem real, does it? I don't like green Christmases. They're not\ngreen--they're just nasty faded browns and grays. What makes people call\nthem green? Why--why--Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew!\"\nMatthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and\nheld it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be\ncontemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene\nout of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air.\nAnne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty\nit was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt\nwith dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the\nmost fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.\nBut the sleeves--they were the crowning glory! Long elbow cuffs, and\nabove them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of\nbrown-silk ribbon.\n\"That's a Christmas present for you, Anne,\" said Matthew shyly.\n\"Why--why--Anne, don't you like it? Well now--well now.\"\nFor Anne's eyes had suddenly filled with tears.\n\"Like it! Oh, Matthew!\" Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped\nher hands. \"Matthew, it's perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank you\nenough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy\ndream.\"\n\"Well, well, let us have breakfast,\" interrupted Marilla. \"I must say,\nAnne, I don't think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it\nfor you, see that you take good care of it. There's a hair ribbon Mrs.\nLynde left for you. It's brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in.\"",

I must be dreaming.\"\n\"I call it providential,\" said Diana. \"You won't have to borrow Ruby's\nslippers now, and that's a blessing, for they're two sizes too big for\nyou, and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling. Josie Pye would\nbe delighted. Mind you, Rob Wright went home with Gertie Pye from the\npractice night before last. Did you ever hear anything equal to that?\"",

Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to\nsend an account of it to the Charlottetown papers.\"\n\"Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? It makes me thrill to\nthink of it.

I just said to myself, 'It is my dear bosom\nfriend who is so honored.'\"\n\"Well, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne. That sad one\nwas simply splendid.\"\n\"Oh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan called out my name I really\ncannot tell how I ever got up on that platform. I felt as if a million\neyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I\nwas sure I couldn't begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed\nsleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves,\nDiana. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so\nfar away. I just felt like a parrot. It's providential that I practiced\nthose recitations so often up in the garret, or I'd never have been able\nto get through. Did I groan all right?\"\n\"Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely,\" assured Diana.\n\"I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down. It was\nsplendid to think I had touched somebody's heart. It's so romantic\nto take part in a concert, isn't it? Oh, it's been a very memorable\noccasion indeed.\"",

            "text": "The winter weeks slipped by. It was an unusually mild winter, with so\nlittle snow that Anne and Diana could go to school nearly every day by\nway of the Birch Path. On Anne's birthday they were tripping lightly\ndown it, keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss\nStacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on \"A\nWinter's Walk in the Woods,\" and it behooved them to be observant.\n\"Just think, Diana, I'm thirteen years old today,\" remarked Anne in an\nawed voice. \"I can scarcely realize that I'm in my teens. When I woke\nthis morning it seemed to me that everything must be different. You've\nbeen thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn't seem such a novelty\nto you as it does to me. It makes life seem so much more interesting.\nIn two more years I'll be really grown up. It's a great comfort to think\nthat I'll be able to use big words then without being laughed at.\"\n\"Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she's fifteen,\"\nsaid Diana.\n\"Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus,\" said Anne disdainfully.\n\"She's actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a\ntake-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. But I'm afraid that is an\nuncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable\nspeeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don't they? I\nsimply can't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech,\nso I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I'm trying to\nbe as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she's perfect.\nMr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she\ntreads on and she doesn't really think it right for a minister to\nset his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even\nministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody\nelse. I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting\nsins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it's proper\nto talk about on Sundays and that is one of them. My besetting sin is\nimagining too much and forgetting my duties. I'm striving very hard\nto overcome it and now that I'm really thirteen perhaps I'll get on\nbetter.\"\n\"In four more years we'll be able to put our hair up,\" said Diana.\n\"Alice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I think\nthat's ridiculous. I shall wait until I'm seventeen.\"\n\"If I had Alice Bell's crooked nose,\" said Anne decidedly, \"I\nwouldn't--but there! I won't say what I was going to because it was\nextremely uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and\nthat's vanity. I'm afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I\nheard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to\nme. Oh, Diana, look, there's a rabbit. That's something to remember for\nour woods composition. I really think the woods are just as lovely in\nwinter as in summer. They're so white and still, as if they were asleep\nand dreaming pretty dreams.\"",

The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to write a\nstory out of our own heads!\"\n\"Why, it's as easy as wink,\" said Anne.\n\"It's easy for you because you have an imagination,\" retorted Diana,\n\"but what would you do if you had been born without one? I suppose you\nhave your composition all done?\"\nAnne nodded, trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing\nmiserably.\n\"I wrote it last Monday evening. It's called 'The Jealous Rival; or In\nDeath Not Divided.' I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and\nnonsense. Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine. That is\nthe kind of critic I like. It's a sad, sweet story. I just cried like\na child while I was writing it. It's about two beautiful maidens called\nCordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village\nand were devotedly attached to each other. Cordelia was a regal brunette\nwith a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes. Geraldine was\na queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.\"\n\"I never saw anybody with purple eyes,\" said Diana dubiously.\n\"Neither did I. I just imagined them. I wanted something out of the\ncommon. Geraldine had an alabaster brow too. I've found out what an\nalabaster brow is. That is one of the advantages of being thirteen. You\nknow so much more than you did when you were only twelve.\"\n\"Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?\" asked Diana, who was\nbeginning to feel rather interested in their fate.\n\"They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen. Then Bertram\nDeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair\nGeraldine. He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a\ncarriage, and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three\nmiles; because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up. I found\nit rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to\ngo by. I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed\nbecause I thought she'd likely be an authority on the subject, having so\nmany sisters married. Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when\nMalcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan. She said Malcolm told Susan\nthat his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, 'What\ndo you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?' And Susan said,\n'Yes--no--I don't know--let me see'--and there they were, engaged as\nquick as that. But I didn't think that sort of a proposal was a very\nromantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could.\nI made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees,\nalthough Ruby Gillis says it isn't done nowadays. Geraldine accepted\nhim in a speech a page long. I can tell you I took a lot of trouble\nwith that speech. I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my\nmasterpiece. Bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace\nand told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour, for he was\nimmensely wealthy. But then, alas, shadows began to darken over their\npath. Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when\nGeraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious,\nespecially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring. All her\naffection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she\nshould never marry Bertram. But she pretended to be Geraldine's friend\nthe same as ever. One evening they were standing on the bridge over a\nrushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were alone, pushed\nGeraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, 'Ha, ha, ha.' But Bertram\nsaw it all and he at once plunged into the current, exclaiming, 'I\nwill save thee, my peerless Geraldine.' But alas, he had forgotten he\ncouldn't swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other's arms.\nTheir bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the\none grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana. It's so much\nmore romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding. As for\nCordelia, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic\nasylum. I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime.\"",

I read one of\nmy stories to him and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was\nexcellent. Only they laughed in the wrong places. I like it better when\npeople cry. Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic\nparts. Diana wrote her Aunt Josephine about our club and her Aunt\nJosephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories. So\nwe copied out four of our very best and sent them. Miss Josephine Barry\nwrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life. That\nkind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost\neverybody died. But I'm glad Miss Barry liked them. It shows our club\nis doing some good in the world.

I felt\nso encouraged when I heard that. Is it very wicked of me, Marilla,\nto feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and\nmischievous? Mrs. Lynde says it is. Mrs. Lynde says she always feels\nshocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how\nsmall they were. Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that\nwhen he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt's pantry\nand she never had any respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldn't\nhave felt that way. I'd have thought that it was real noble of him to\nconfess it, and I'd have thought what an encouraging thing it would be\nfor small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them\nto know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it.\nThat's how I'd feel, Marilla.\"\n\"The way I feel at present, Anne,\" said Marilla, \"is that it's high time\nyou had those dishes washed. You've taken half an hour longer than\nyou should with all your chattering. Learn to work first and talk\nafterwards.\"",

I've been expecting something queer for\nsome time. You haven't got into any scrape for over two months, and I\nwas sure another one was due. Now, then, what did you do to your hair?\"\n\"I dyed it.\"\n\"Dyed it! Dyed your hair! Anne Shirley, didn't you know it was a wicked\nthing to do?\"\n\"Yes, I knew it was a little wicked,\" admitted Anne. \"But I thought it\nwas worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair. I counted\nthe cost, Marilla. Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to\nmake up for it.\"\n\"Well,\" said Marilla sarcastically, \"if I'd decided it was worth while\nto dye my hair I'd have dyed it a decent color at least. I wouldn't have\ndyed it green.\"\n\"But I didn't mean to dye it green, Marilla,\" protested Anne dejectedly.\n\"If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose. He said it would\nturn my hair a beautiful raven black--he positively assured me that it\nwould. How could I doubt his word, Marilla? I know what it feels like\nto have your word doubted. And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect\nanyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they're\nnot. I have proof now--green hair is proof enough for anybody. But I\nhadn't then and I believed every word he said _implicitly_.\"",

I remembered what you told me, and I\nwent out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his things on the step.\nBesides, he wasn't an Italian--he was a German Jew. He had a big box\nfull of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to\nmake enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany. He\nspoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy\nsomething from him to help him in such a worthy object. Then all at once\nI saw the bottle of hair dye. The peddler said it was warranted to dye\nany hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn't wash off. In a trice I\nsaw myself with beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was\nirresistible. But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I\nhad only fifty cents left out of my chicken money. I think the peddler\nhad a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, he'd sell it\nfor fifty cents and that was just giving it away. So I bought it, and as\nsoon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush\nas the directions said. I used up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla,\nwhen I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being\nwicked, I can tell you. And I've been repenting ever since.\"\n\"Well, I hope you'll repent to good purpose,\" said Marilla severely,\n\"and that you've got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you,",

They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to\npieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all\nleft in it for them, but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and\nGuinevere and King Arthur had become very real people to them, and Anne\nwas devoured by secret regret that she had not been born in Camelot.\nThose days, she said, were so much more romantic than the present.\nAnne's plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if\nthe flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down\nwith the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another\nheadland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond. They had often\ngone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing\nElaine.\n\"Well, I'll be Elaine,\" said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for, although\nshe would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet\nher artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her\nlimitations made impossible. \"Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane\nwill be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot.

            "text": "\"Anne,\" he said hurriedly, \"look here. Can't we be good friends? I'm\nawfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time. I didn't mean to vex\nyou and I only meant it for a joke. Besides, it's so long ago. I think\nyour hair is awfully pretty now--honest I do. Let's be friends.\"\nFor a moment Anne hesitated. She had an odd, newly awakened\nconsciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy,\nhalf-eager expression in Gilbert's hazel eyes was something that was\nvery good to see. Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat. But the\nbitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering\ndetermination. That scene of two years before flashed back into her\nrecollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. Gilbert had\ncalled her \"carrots\" and had brought about her disgrace before the whole\nschool. Her resentment, which to other and older people might be as\nlaughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time\nseemingly. She hated Gilbert Blythe! She would never forgive him!\n\"No,\" she said coldly, \"I shall never be friends with you, Gilbert\nBlythe; and I don't want to be!\"\n\"All right!\" Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his\ncheeks. \"I'll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley. And I\ndon't care either!\"\nHe pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and Anne went up the steep,\nferny little path under the maples. She held her head very high, but\nshe was conscious of an odd feeling of regret. She almost wished she had\nanswered Gilbert differently. Of course, he had insulted her terribly,\nbut still--! Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to\nsit down and have a good cry. She was really quite unstrung, for the\nreaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.\nHalfway up the path she met Jane and Diana rushing back to the pond in\na state narrowly removed from positive frenzy. They had found nobody at\nOrchard Slope, both Mr. and Mrs. Barry being away. Here Ruby Gillis had\nsuccumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she\nmight, while Jane and Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the\nbrook to Green Gables. There they had found nobody either, for Marilla\nhad gone to Carmody and Matthew was making hay in the back field.\n\"Oh, Anne,\" gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former's neck\nand weeping with relief and delight, \"oh, Anne--we thought--you\nwere--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because we had made--you\nbe--Elaine. And Ruby is in hysterics--oh, Anne, how did you escape?\"\n\"I climbed up on one of the piles,\" explained Anne wearily, \"and Gilbert\nBlythe came along in Mr. Andrews's dory and brought me to land.\"\n\"Oh, Anne, how splendid of him! Why, it's so romantic!\" said Jane,\nfinding breath enough for utterance at last. \"Of course you'll speak to\nhim after this.\"\n\"Of course I won't,\" flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old\nspirit. \"And I don't want ever to hear the word 'romantic' again, Jane\nAndrews. I'm awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls. It is all my\nfault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do\ngets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We've gone and lost your\nfather's flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we'll not be\nallowed to row on the pond any more.\"\nAnne's presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt\nto do. Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households\nwhen the events of the afternoon became known.\n\"Will you ever have any sense, Anne?\" groaned Marilla.\n\"Oh, yes, I think I will, Marilla,\" returned Anne optimistically. A good\ncry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed\nher nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness. \"I think my\nprospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever.\"\n\"I don't see how,\" said Marilla.\n\"Well,\" explained Anne, \"I've learned a new and valuable lesson today.\nEver since I came to Green Gables I've been making mistakes, and each\nmistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The affair of\nthe amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn't belong\nto me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run\naway with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in\ncooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair\nand nose now--at least, very seldom. And today's mistake is going to\ncure me of being too romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it is\nno use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in\ntowered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated\nnow. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me\nin this respect, Marilla.\"\n\"I'm sure I hope so,\" said Marilla skeptically.\nBut Matthew, who had been sitting mutely in his corner, laid a hand on\nAnne's shoulder when Marilla had gone out.\n\"Don't give up all your romance, Anne,\" he whispered shyly, \"a little\nof it is a good thing--not too much, of course--but keep a little of it,\nAnne, keep a little of it.\"",

I don't really know which department was the\nmost interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the\nfancywork best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was\nreal glad she did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I'm\nimproving, don't you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie's\nsuccess? Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples\nand Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig. Diana said she thought it was\nridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs,\nbut I don't see why. Do you? She said she would always think of it after\nthis when he was praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a\nprize for painting, and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter\nand cheese. So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn't it? Mrs.\nLynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her\nuntil I saw her familiar face among all those strangers. There\nwere thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel dreadfully\ninsignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see\nthe horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn't go; she said horse racing was an\nabomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty\nto set a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I\ndon't believe Mrs. Lynde's absence would ever be noticed. I don't think,\nthough, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_\nawfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me\nten cents that the red horse would win. I didn't believe he would, but\nI refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about\neverything, and I felt sure it wouldn't do to tell her that. It's always\nwrong to do anything you can't tell the minister's wife. It's as good as\nan extra conscience to have a minister's wife for your friend. And I was\nvery glad I didn't bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and I would have\nlost ten cents. So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a man\ngo up in a balloon. I'd love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would\nbe simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten\ncents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you. Miss Barry gave\nDiana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told. Mine was that I\nwould marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go\nacross water to live. I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after\nthat, but I didn't care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose\nit's too early to be looking out for him yet. Oh, it was a\nnever-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla. I was so tired I couldn't sleep at\nnight. Miss Barry put us in the spare room, according to promise. It\nwas an elegant room, Marilla, but somehow sleeping in a spare room isn't\nwhat I used to think it was. That's the worst of growing up, and I'm",

To Anne the evening was a glittering vision of\ndelight.\n\"Oh, Marilla, it was beyond description. I was so excited I couldn't\neven talk, so you may know what it was like. I just sat in enraptured\nsilence. Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin\nand diamonds. But when she began to sing I never thought about anything\nelse. Oh, I can't tell you how I felt. But it seemed to me that it could\nnever be hard to be good any more. I felt like I do when I look up to\nthe stars. Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears.\nI was so sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn't see\nhow I was ever to return to common life again. She said she thought if\nwe went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream\nit might help me. That sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found\nit true. The ice cream was delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and\ndissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o'clock at night.\nDiana said she believed she was born for city life. Miss Barry asked\nme what my opinion was, but I said I would have to think it over very\nseriously before I could tell her what I really thought. So I thought it\nover after I went to bed. That is the best time to think things out. And\nI came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasn't born for city life and\nthat I was glad of it. It's nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant\nrestaurants at eleven o'clock at night once in a while; but as a regular\nthing I'd rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind\nof knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that\nthe wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. I told Miss Barry\nso at breakfast the next morning and she laughed. Miss Barry generally\nlaughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things. I\ndon't think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasn't trying to be funny.\nBut she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.\"",

Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen,\nwhere a hot supper was waiting on the table.\n\"So you've got back?\" said Marilla, folding up her knitting.\n\"Yes, and oh, it's so good to be back,\" said Anne joyously. \"I could\nkiss everything, even to the clock. Marilla, a broiled chicken! You\ndon't mean to say you cooked that for me!\"\n\"Yes, I did,\" said Marilla. \"I thought you'd be hungry after such\na drive and need something real appetizing.

Diana wouldn't say much about that, though.\nDiana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about\nimagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood. It had a very bad effect on\nDiana's imagination. It blighted it. Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a\nblighted being. I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted, and Ruby\nsaid she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her. Ruby\nGillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse\nshe is. Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn't do to\ndrag them into everything, does it?

Diana hasn't quite made up her mind though,\nbecause she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild,\ndashing, wicked young man and reform him. Diana and I talk a great deal\nabout serious subjects now, you know. We feel that we are so much older\nthan we used to be that it isn't becoming to talk of childish matters.\nIt's such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen, Marilla. Miss Stacy took\nall us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday, and\ntalked to us about it. She said we couldn't be too careful what habits\nwe formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens, because by the time\nwe were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid\nfor our whole future life. And she said if the foundation was shaky we\ncould never build anything really worth while on it. Diana and I talked\nthe matter over coming home from school. We felt extremely solemn,\nMarilla. And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and\nform respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as\npossible, so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be",

She was talking about you.\"\n\"About me?\" Anne looked rather scared. Then she flushed and exclaimed:\n\"Oh, I know what she was saying. I meant to tell you, Marilla, honestly\nI did, but I forgot. Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school\nyesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian\nhistory. Jane Andrews lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour,\nand I had just got to the chariot race when school went in. I was simply\nwild to know how it turned out--although I felt sure Ben Hur must win,\nbecause it wouldn't be poetical justice if he didn't--so I spread the\nhistory open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and\nmy knee. I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know,\nwhile all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it\nthat I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at\nonce I just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so\nreproachful-like. I can't tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla,\nespecially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur\naway, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and\ntalked to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I\nwas wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly,\nI was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a\nhistory when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that\nmoment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I\ncried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I'd never do such\na thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking\nat Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned\nout. But Miss Stacy said she wouldn't require that, and she forgave me\nfreely. So I think it wasn't very kind of her to come up here to you\nabout it after all.\"\n\"Miss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me, Anne, and its only your",

            "text": "The Queen's class was organized in due time. Gilbert Blythe, Anne\nShirley, Ruby Gillis, Jane Andrews, Josie Pye, Charlie Sloane, and Moody\nSpurgeon MacPherson joined it. Diana Barry did not, as her parents\ndid not intend to send her to Queen's. This seemed nothing short of a\ncalamity to Anne. Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the\ncroup, had she and Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when\nthe Queen's class first remained in school for the extra lessons and\nAnne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through\nthe Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep\nher seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. A lump\ncame into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her\nuplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. Not for worlds\nwould Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears.\n\"But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of\ndeath, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go\nout alone,\" she said mournfully that night. \"I thought how splendid it\nwould have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance,\ntoo. But we can't have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs.\nLynde says. Mrs. Lynde isn't exactly a comforting person sometimes, but\nthere's no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the\nQueen's class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby\nare just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their\nambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets\nthrough, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote\nher whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid\na salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything, and growls\nif you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks\nfrom mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a\nperfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she\nis just going to college for education's sake, because she won't have to\nearn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who\nare living on charity--_they_ have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to\nbe a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn't be anything else with a name\nlike that to live up to. I hope it isn't wicked of me, Marilla, but\nreally the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.\nHe's such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little\nblue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will\nbe more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he's\ngoing to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde\nsays he'll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest\npeople, and it's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.\"",

Previously the\nrivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt\nthat Gilbert was as determined to be first in class as Anne was. He was\na foeman worthy of her steel. The other members of the class tacitly\nacknowledged their superiority, and never dreamed of trying to compete\nwith them.\nSince the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea\nfor forgiveness, Gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry,\nhad evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of Anne Shirley. He\ntalked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with\nthem, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the\nother of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley\nhe simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be\nignored. It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head\nthat she did not care. Deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart\nshe knew that she did care, and that if she had that chance of the Lake\nof Shining Waters again she would answer very differently. All at\nonce, as it seemed, and to her secret dismay, she found that the old\nresentment she had cherished against him was gone--gone just when she\nmost needed its sustaining power. It was in vain that she recalled every\nincident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel\nthe old satisfying anger. That day by the pond had witnessed its last\nspasmodic flicker. Anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten\nwithout knowing it. But it was too late.\nAnd at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should\never suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn't been\nso proud and horrid! She determined to \"shroud her feelings in deepest\noblivion,\" and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so\nsuccessfully that Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as\nhe seemed, could not console himself with any belief that Anne felt his\nretaliatory scorn.

I've\nhad a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I'm rejoicing as a\nstrong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesn't Mr.\nAllan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every\nday and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up\nand then we'll be left and have to turn to and break in another green\npreacher. But I don't see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you,\nMarilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we\nhave him. If I were a man I think I'd be a minister. They can have\nsuch an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be\nthrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers' hearts. Why\ncan't women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was\nshocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might\nbe female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank\ngoodness we hadn't got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we\nnever would. But I don't see why. I think women would make splendid\nministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or\nanything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work.\nI'm sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell\nand I've no doubt she could preach too with a little practice.\"\n\"Yes, I believe she could,\" said Marilla dryly. \"She does plenty of\nunofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong\nin Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.\"\n\"Marilla,\" said Anne in a burst of confidence, \"I want to tell you\nsomething and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me\nterribly--on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about\nsuch matters. I do really want to be good; and when I'm with you or Mrs.\nAllan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what\nwould please you and what you would approve of. But mostly when I'm with\nMrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the\nvery thing she tells me I oughtn't to do. I feel irresistibly tempted\nto do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you\nthink it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?\"\nMarilla looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.\n\"If you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very\neffect on me. I sometimes think she'd have more of an influence for\ngood, as you say yourself, if she didn't keep nagging people to do\nright. There should have been a special commandment against nagging.\nBut there, I shouldn't talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she\nmeans well. There isn't a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks\nher share of work.\"\n\"I'm very glad you feel the same,\" said Anne decidedly. \"It's so\nencouraging. I shan't worry so much over that after this. But I dare say\nthere'll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the\ntime--things to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and\nthere's another right after. There are so many things to be thought over\nand decided when you're beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the\ntime thinking them over and deciding what is right. It's a serious thing\nto grow up, isn't it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as\nyou and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up\nsuccessfully, and I'm sure it will be my own fault if I don't. I feel\nit's a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I\ndon't grow up right I can't go back and begin over again. I've grown two\ninches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby's party. I'm\nso glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty\nand it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of course I know it\nwasn't really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie\nPye has flounces on all her dresses. I know I'll be able to study better\nbecause of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my\nmind about that flounce.\"",

Especially did the Queen's class gird up their loins\nfor the fray, for at the end of the coming year, dimly shadowing their\npathway already, loomed up that fateful thing known as \"the Entrance,\"\nat the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their\nvery shoes. Suppose they did not pass! That thought was doomed to\nhaunt Anne through the waking hours of that winter, Sunday afternoons\ninclusive, to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological\nproblems. When Anne had bad dreams she found herself staring miserably\nat pass lists of the Entrance exams, where Gilbert Blythe's name was\nblazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all.\nBut it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. Schoolwork was\nas interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore. New worlds of\nthought, feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored\nknowledge seemed to be opening out before Anne's eager eyes.\n\"Hills peeped o'er hill and Alps on Alps arose.\"\nMuch of all this was due to Miss Stacy's tactful, careful, broadminded\nguidance. She led her class to think and explore and discover for\nthemselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree\nthat quite shocked Mrs. Lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all\ninnovations on established methods rather dubiously.",

A sigh\nfollowed on the words. Marilla felt a queer regret over Anne's inches.\nThe child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this\ntall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and the\nproudly poised little head, in her place. Marilla loved the girl as much\nas she had loved the child, but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful\nsense of loss. And that night, when Anne had gone to prayer meeting\nwith Diana, Marilla sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the\nweakness of a cry. Matthew, coming in with a lantern, caught her at it\nand gazed at her in such consternation that Marilla had to laugh through\nher tears.\n\"I was thinking about Anne,\" she explained. \"She's got to be such a big\ngirl--and she'll probably be away from us next winter. I'll miss her\nterrible.\"\n\"She'll be able to come home often,\" comforted Matthew, to whom Anne was\nas yet and always would be the little, eager girl he had brought home\nfrom Bright River on that June evening four years before. \"The branch\nrailroad will be built to Carmody by that time.\"\n\"It won't be the same thing as having her here all the time,\" sighed\nMarilla gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted.\n\"But there--men can't understand these things!\"",

What has come over you?\"\nAnne colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked\ndreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on\nthe creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine.\n\"I don't know--I don't want to talk as much,\" she said, denting her\nchin thoughtfully with her forefinger. \"It's nicer to think dear, pretty\nthoughts and keep them in one's heart, like treasures. I don't like to\nhave them laughed at or wondered over. And somehow I don't want to use\nbig words any more. It's almost a pity, isn't it, now that I'm really\ngrowing big enough to say them if I did want to. It's fun to be almost\ngrown up in some ways, but it's not the kind of fun I expected, Marilla.\nThere's so much to learn and do and think that there isn't time for big\nwords. Besides, Miss Stacy says the short ones are much stronger and\nbetter. She makes us write all our essays as simply as possible. It was\nhard at first. I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I\ncould think of--and I thought of any number of them. But I've got used\nto it now and I see it's so much better.\"\n\"What has become of your story club? I haven't heard you speak of it for\na long time.\"\n\"The story club isn't in existence any longer. We hadn't time for\nit--and anyhow I think we had got tired of it. It was silly to be\nwriting about love and murder and elopements and mysteries. Miss Stacy\nsometimes has us write a story for training in composition, but she\nwon't let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own\nlives, and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own\ntoo. I never thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to\nlook for them myself.

She says\nit would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not\nthink about the exams at all and go to bed early. It's good advice, but\nI expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, I think.\nPrissy Andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her\nEntrance week and crammed for dear life; and I had determined to sit up\n_at least_ as long as she did. It was so kind of your Aunt Josephine to\nask me to stay at Beechwood while I'm in town.\"\n\"You'll write to me while you're in, won't you?\"\n\"I'll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes,\" promised\nAnne.",

            "text": "Anne went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday Diana haunted\nthe post office, as agreed, and got her letter.\n\"Dearest Diana\" [wrote Anne],\n\"Here it is Tuesday night and I'm writing this in the library at\nBeechwood. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and\nwished so much you were with me. I couldn't 'cram' because I'd promised\nMiss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history\nas it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were\nlearned.\n\"This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling\nfor Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands\nand they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn't slept\na wink and she didn't believe I was strong enough to stand the grind\nof the teacher's course even if I did get through. There are times and\nseasons even yet when I don't feel that I've made any great headway in\nlearning to like Josie Pye!\n\"When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from\nall over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting\non the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth\nhe was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over\nand over to steady his nerves and for pity's sake not to interrupt\nhim, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot\neverything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts\nfirmly in their proper place!\n\"When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and\nI sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of\nthe multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if\nI looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear\nacross the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English\nexamination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled\naround as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly\nas I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green\nGables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began\nbeating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I\nknew I could do something with _that_ paper anyhow.\n\"At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in\nthe afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully\nmixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh,\nDiana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it\nit takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my\nEuclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would\nrecite it from now till tomorrow morning.\n\"I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody\nSpurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in\nhistory and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he\nwas going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a\ncarpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to\nstay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn't.\nSometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon\nI'm always glad I'm a girl and not his sister.\n\"Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just\ndiscovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When\nshe recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had\nbeen with us.\n\"Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as\nMrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I\nfail in geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I\nthink I'd rather it didn't go on if I failed!\n\"Yours devotedly,\n\"Anne\"",

            "text": "With this end in view Anne had strained every nerve during the\nexaminations. So had Gilbert. They had met and passed each other on the\nstreet a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time Anne\nhad held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly\nthat she had made friends with Gilbert when he asked her, and vowed a\nlittle more determinedly to surpass him in the examination. She knew\nthat all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she\neven knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question\nand that Josie Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that Gilbert\nwould be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if\nshe failed.\nBut she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. She wanted\nto \"pass high\" for the sake of Matthew and Marilla--especially Matthew.\nMatthew had declared to her his conviction that she \"would beat the\nwhole Island.\" That, Anne felt, was something it would be foolish to\nhope for even in the wildest dreams. But she did hope fervently that she\nwould be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew's\nkindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement. That, she\nfelt, would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient\ngrubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations.\nAt the end of the fortnight Anne took to \"haunting\" the post office\nalso, in the distracted company of Jane, Ruby, and Josie, opening the\nCharlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings\nas bad as any experienced during the Entrance week. Charlie and Gilbert\nwere not above doing this too, but Moody Spurgeon stayed resolutely\naway.\n\"I haven't got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,\"\nhe told Anne. \"I'm just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me\nsuddenly whether I've passed or not.\"\nWhen three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Anne began\nto feel that she really couldn't stand the strain much longer. Her\nappetite failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished.\nMrs. Lynde wanted to know what else you could expect with a Tory\nsuperintendent of education at the head of affairs, and Matthew, noting\nAnne's paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her\nhome from the post office every afternoon, began seriously to wonder if\nhe hadn't better vote Grit at the next election.\nBut one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her open window,\nfor the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the\nworld, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with\nflower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the\nstir of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink\nfrom the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the\nspirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying\ndown through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a\nfluttering newspaper in her hand.\nAnne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The\npass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt\nher. She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Diana\ncame rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even\nknocking, so great was her excitement.\n\"Anne, you've passed,\" she cried, \"passed the _very first_--you and\nGilbert both--you're ties--but your name is first. Oh, I'm so proud!\"\nDiana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne's bed, utterly\nbreathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp,\noversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her\nshaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper.\nYes, she had passed--there was her name at the very top of a list of two\nhundred! That moment was worth living for.\n\"You did just splendidly, Anne,\" puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently\nto sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a\nword. \"Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes\nago--it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won't be here\ntill tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over\nlike a wild thing. You've all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon\nand all, although he's conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty\nwell--they're halfway up--and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through\nwith three marks to spare, but you'll see she'll put on as many airs as\nif she'd led. Won't Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel\nlike to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were\nme I know I'd go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but\nyou're as calm and cool as a spring evening.\"",

            "text": "PUT on your white organdy, by all means, Anne,\" advised Diana\ndecidedly.\nThey were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only\ntwilight--a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless\nsky. A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into\nburnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet\nsummer sounds--sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway\nvoices and laughter. But in Anne's room the blind was drawn and the lamp\nlighted, for an important toilet was being made.\nThe east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that\nnight four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to\nthe marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept\nin, Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and\ndainty a nest as a young girl could desire.\nThe velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of\nAnne's early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams\nhad kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented\nthem. The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that\nsoftened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of\npale-green art muslin. The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade\ntapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few\ngood pictures given Anne by Mrs. Allan. Miss Stacy's photograph occupied\nthe place of honor, and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh\nflowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly\nperfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance. There was no \"mahogany\nfurniture,\" but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a\ncushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin,\na quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes\npainted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a\nlow white bed.\nAnne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had\ngot it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all\nthe available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it\nalong. Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir\nhad been asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a\nviolin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad;\nand Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to\nrecite.\nAs Anne would have said at one time, it was \"an epoch in her life,\" and\nshe was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in\nthe seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his\nAnne and Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather\nthan admit it, and said she didn't think it was very proper for a lot\nof young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible\nperson with them.\nAnne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother\nBilly in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and\nboys were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from\ntown, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.\n\"Do you really think the organdy will be best?\" queried Anne anxiously.\n\"I don't think it's as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it\ncertainly isn't so fashionable.\"\n\"But it suits you ever so much better,\" said Diana. \"It's so soft\nand frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too\ndressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.\"\nAnne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for\nnotable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much\nsought after. She was looking very pretty herself on this particular\nnight in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was\nforever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so\nher appearance was of minor importance. All her pains were bestowed upon\nAnne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and\ncombed and adorned to the Queen's taste.\n\"Pull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now\nfor your slippers. I'm going to braid your hair in two thick braids,\nand tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, don't pull out a single\ncurl over your forehead--just have the soft part. There is no way you do\nyour hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a\nMadonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose\njust behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for\nyou.\"\n\"Shall I put my pearl beads on?\" asked Anne. \"Matthew brought me a\nstring from town last week, and I know he'd like to see them on me.\"\nDiana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically,\nand finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied\naround Anne's slim milk-white throat.\n\"There's something so stylish about you, Anne,\" said Diana, with\nunenvious admiration. \"You hold your head with such an air. I suppose\nit's your figure. I am just a dumpling. I've always been afraid of it,\nand now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign\nmyself to it.\"\n\"But you have such dimples,\" said Anne, smiling affectionately into the\npretty, vivacious face so near her own. \"Lovely dimples, like little\ndents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream\nwill never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn't\ncomplain. Am I all ready now?\"\n\"All ready,\" assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt\nfigure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a\nmuch softer face. \"Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla.\nDoesn't she look lovely?\"\nMarilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.\n\"She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I\nexpect she'll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew\nwith it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy's the\nmost unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when\nhe got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays.\nTime was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for\nAnne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything\noff on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable,\nand Matthew plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear\nof the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.\"",

What were her\npearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her?\nAnd how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse\nflowers the others wore! Anne laid her hat and jacket away, and shrank\nmiserably into a corner. She wished herself back in the white room at\nGreen Gables.\nIt was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel,\nwhere she presently found herself. The electric lights dazzled her eyes,\nthe perfume and hum bewildered her. She wished she were sitting down\nin the audience with Diana and Jane, who seemed to be having a splendid\ntime away at the back. She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink\nsilk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress. The stout\nlady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed Anne\nthrough her eyeglasses until Anne, acutely sensitive of being so\nscrutinized, felt that she must scream aloud; and the white-lace girl\nkept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the \"country bumpkins\"\nand \"rustic belles\" in the audience, languidly anticipating \"such fun\"\nfrom the displays of local talent on the program. Anne believed that she\nwould hate that white-lace girl to the end of life.\nUnfortunately for Anne, a professional elocutionist was staying at the\nhotel and had consented to recite. She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a\nwonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems\non her neck and in her dark hair. She had a marvelously flexible voice\nand wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her\nselection. Anne, forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the\ntime, listened with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended\nshe suddenly put her hands over her face. She could never get up and\nrecite after that--never. Had she ever thought she could recite? Oh, if\nshe were only back at Green Gables!",

Somehow Anne--who did\nnot notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace\ngirl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied\ntherein if she had--got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front.\nShe was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each\nother's hands in nervous sympathy.\nAnne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as\nshe had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience\nas this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely.\nEverything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of\nladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of\nwealth and culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches\nat the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of\nfriends and neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless\ncritics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement\nfrom her \"rustic\" efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and\nmiserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness\ncame over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would\nhave fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt,\nmust ever after be her portion if she did so.\nBut suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the\naudience, she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending\nforward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once\ntriumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert\nwas merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and\nof the effect produced by Anne's slender white form and spiritual face\nagainst a background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had\ndriven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant\nand taunting. But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if\nshe had. She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage\nand determination tingling over her like an electric shock. She _would\nnot_ fail before Gilbert Blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her,\nnever, never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her\nrecitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of\nthe room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored\nto her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness\nshe recited as she had never done before. When she finished there were\nbursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing\nwith shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken\nby the stout lady in pink silk.\n\"My dear, you did splendidly,\" she puffed. \"I've been crying like a\nbaby, actually I have. There, they're encoring you--they're bound to\nhave you back!\"\n\"Oh, I can't go,\" said Anne confusedly. \"But yet--I must, or Matthew\nwill be disappointed. He said they would encore me.\"\n\"Then don't disappoint Matthew,\" said the pink lady, laughing.\nSmiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint,\nfunny little selection that captivated her audience still further. The\nrest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.",

The professional\nelocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that\nshe had a charming voice and \"interpreted\" her selections beautifully.\nEven the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had\nsupper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane\nwere invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne,\nbut Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear\nof some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team,\nhowever, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into\nthe calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked\ninto the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.\nOh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night!\nHow great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the\nsea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants\nguarding enchanted coasts.\n\"Hasn't it been a perfectly splendid time?\" sighed Jane, as they drove\naway. \"I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at\na hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and\nchicken salad every blessed day. I'm sure it would be ever so much\nmore fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great,\nalthough I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it\nwas better than Mrs. Evans's.\"\n\"Oh, no, don't say things like that, Jane,\" said Anne quickly, \"because\nit sounds silly. It couldn't be better than Mrs. Evans's, you know, for\nshe is a professional, and I'm only a schoolgirl, with a little knack\nof reciting. I'm quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty\nwell.\"\n\"I've a compliment for you, Anne,\" said Diana. \"At least I think it\nmust be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it\nwas anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a\nromantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he\nis a distinguished artist, and that her mother's cousin in Boston is\nmarried to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard\nhim say--didn't we, Jane?--'Who is that girl on the platform with the\nsplendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.' There now,\nAnne. But what does Titian hair mean?\"\n\"Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,\" laughed Anne. \"Titian\nwas a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.\"\n\"_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?\" sighed Jane. \"They\nwere simply dazzling. Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?\"\n\"We _are_ rich,\" said Anne staunchly. \"Why, we have sixteen years to our\ncredit, and we're happy as queens, and we've all got imaginations, more\nor less. Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of\nthings not seen. We couldn't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had\nmillions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldn't change into any\nof those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl\nand wear a sour look all your life, as if you'd been born turning up\nyour nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so\nstout and short that you'd really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans,\nwith that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully\nunhappy sometime to have such a look. You _know_ you wouldn't, Jane\nAndrews!\"\n\"I _don't_ know--exactly,\" said Jane unconvinced. \"I think diamonds would\ncomfort a person for a good deal.\"\n\"Well, I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by\ndiamonds all my life,\" declared Anne. \"I'm quite content to be Anne of\nGreen Gables, with my string of pearl beads. I know Matthew gave me as\nmuch love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady's jewels.\"",

Anne's outfit was\nample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made\nno objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested. More--one\nevening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate\npale green material.\n\"Anne, here's something for a nice light dress for you. I don't suppose\nyou really need it; you've plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe\nyou'd like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere\nof an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that\nJane and Ruby and Josie have got 'evening dresses,' as they call them,\nand I don't mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me\npick it in town last week, and we'll get Emily Gillis to make it for\nyou. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren't to be equaled.\"\n\"Oh, Marilla, it's just lovely,\" said Anne. \"Thank you so much. I don't\nbelieve you ought to be so kind to me--it's making it harder every day\nfor me to go away.\"\nThe green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings\nas Emily's taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew's\nand Marilla's benefit, and recited \"The Maiden's Vow\" for them in the\nkitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful\nmotions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green\nGables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child\nin her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking\nout of her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to\nMarilla's own eyes.\n\"I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,\" said Anne gaily\nstooping over Marilla's chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady's\ncheek. \"Now, I call that a positive triumph.\"\n\"No, I wasn't crying over your piece,\" said Marilla, who would have\nscorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. \"I just\ncouldn't help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. And\nI was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your\nqueer ways. You've grown up now and you're going away; and you look so\ntall and stylish and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if\nyou didn't belong in Avonlea at all--and I just got lonesome thinking it\nall over.\"\n\"Marilla!\" Anne sat down on Marilla's gingham lap, took Marilla's lined\nface between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla's\neyes. \"I'm not a bit changed--not really. I'm only just pruned down and\nbranched out. The real _me_--back here--is just the same. It won't make a\nbit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I\nshall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear\nGreen Gables more and better every day of her life.\"\nAnne laid her fresh young cheek against Marilla's faded one, and reached\nout a hand to pat Matthew's shoulder. Marilla would have given much just\nthen to have possessed Anne's power of putting her feelings into words;\nbut nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her\narms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing\nthat she need never let her go.\nMatthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went\nout-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked\nagitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.\n\"Well now, I guess she ain't been much spoiled,\" he muttered, proudly.\n\"I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all.\nShe's smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the\nrest. She's been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake\nthan what Mrs. Spencer made--if it _was_ luck. I don't believe it was any\nsuch thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her, I\nreckon.\"",

That first day passed pleasantly enough in a\nwhirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the\nprofessors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne\nintended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss\nStacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same. This meant getting a\nFirst Class teacher's license in one year instead of two, if they were\nsuccessful; but it also meant much more and harder work. Jane, Ruby,\nJosie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the\nstirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work.\nAnne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in\na room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the\ntall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion\nshe did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically.\nYet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old\nrivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what\nto do if it had been lacking.\n\"I wouldn't feel comfortable without it,\" she thought. \"Gilbert looks\nawfully determined. I suppose he's making up his mind, here and now, to\nwin the medal. What a splendid chin he has! I never noticed it before.\nI do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class, too. I suppose I\nwon't feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted,\nthough. I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends.\nIt's really an interesting speculation. Of course I promised Diana that\nno Queen's girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear\nto me as she is; but I've lots of second-best affections to bestow. I\nlike the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist.\nShe looks vivid and red-rosy; there's that pale, fair one gazing out of\nthe window. She has lovely hair, and looks as if she knew a thing or two\nabout dreams. I'd like to know them both--know them well--well enough to\nwalk with my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames. But just\nnow I don't know them and they don't know me, and probably don't want to\nknow me particularly. Oh, it's lonesome!\"",

Miss Josephine Barry\nwould have liked to board her, but Beechwood was so far from the\nAcademy that it was out of the question; so Miss Barry hunted up a\nboarding-house, assuring Matthew and Marilla that it was the very place\nfor Anne.\n\"The lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman,\" explained Miss Barry.\n\"Her husband was a British officer, and she is very careful what sort\nof boarders she takes. Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons\nunder her roof. The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in\na quiet neighborhood.\"\nAll this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did\nnot materially help Anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized\nupon her. She looked dismally about her narrow little room, with its\ndull-papered, pictureless walls, its small iron bedstead and empty\nbook-case; and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of\nher own white room at Green Gables, where she would have the pleasant\nconsciousness of a great green still outdoors, of sweet peas growing in\nthe garden, and moonlight falling on the orchard, of the brook below the\nslope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it, of a\nvast starry sky, and the light from Diana's window shining out through\nthe gap in the trees. Here there was nothing of this; Anne knew that\noutside of her window was a hard street, with a network of telephone\nwires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand\nlights gleaming on stranger faces. She knew that she was going to cry,\nand fought against it.\n\"I _won't_ cry. It's silly--and weak--there's the third tear splashing\ndown by my nose. There are more coming! I must think of something funny\nto stop them. But there's nothing funny except what is connected with\nAvonlea, and that only makes things worse--four--five--I'm going home\nnext Friday, but that seems a hundred years away.

Before\nJosie had told the news Anne's highest pinnacle of aspiration had been\na teacher's provincial license, First Class, at the end of the year, and\nperhaps the medal! But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning\nthe Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and\ngraduating in a gown and mortar board, before the echo of Josie's words\nhad died away. For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt\nthat here her foot was on native heath.\nA wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his\nfortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed\namong the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces,\naccording to their respective standings. There had been much doubt\nwhether one would be allotted to Queen's, but the matter was settled at\nlast, and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark\nin English and English Literature would win the scholarship--two hundred\nand fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College. No wonder\nthat Anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks!\n\"I'll win that scholarship if hard work can do it,\" she resolved.\n\"Wouldn't Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh, it's delightful to\nhave ambitions. I'm so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to\nbe any end to them--that's the best of it.

Ruby was a very handsome young lady, now thinking\nherself quite as grown up as she really was; she wore her skirts as long\nas her mother would let her and did her hair up in town, though she had\nto take it down when she went home. She had large, bright-blue eyes,\na brilliant complexion, and a plump showy figure. She laughed a great\ndeal, was cheerful and good-tempered, and enjoyed the pleasant things of\nlife frankly.\n\"But I shouldn't think she was the sort of girl Gilbert would like,\"\nwhispered Jane to Anne. Anne did not think so either, but she would not\nhave said so for the Avery scholarship. She could not help thinking,\ntoo, that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as Gilbert\nto jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and\nambitions. Gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem\nthe sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed.\nThere was no silly sentiment in Anne's ideas concerning Gilbert. Boys\nwere to her, when she thought about them at all, merely possible good\ncomrades. If she and Gilbert had been friends she would not have cared\nhow many other friends he had nor with whom he walked. She had a genius\nfor friendship; girl friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague\nconsciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing\nto round out one's conceptions of companionship and furnish broader\nstandpoints of judgment and comparison. Not that Anne could have put her\nfeelings on the matter into just such clear definition. But she thought\nthat if Gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train, over the\ncrisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and\nmerry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening\naround them and their hopes and ambitions therein. Gilbert was a clever\nyoung fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to\nget the best out of life and put the best into it. Ruby Gillis told Jane\nAndrews that she didn't understand half the things Gilbert Blythe said;\nhe talked just like Anne Shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on\nand for her part she didn't think it any fun to be bothering about books\nand that sort of thing when you didn't have to. Frank Stockley had lots\nmore dash and go, but then he wasn't half as good-looking as Gilbert and\nshe really couldn't decide which she liked best!",

By this time all the Queen's\nscholars had gravitated into their own places in the ranks and\nthe various classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of\nindividuality. Certain facts had become generally accepted. It was\nadmitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down\nto three--Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, and Lewis Wilson; the Avery\nscholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible\nwinner. The bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as\nwon by a fat, funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a\npatched coat.\nRuby Gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the Academy; in the\nSecond Year classes Stella Maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with\nsmall but critical minority in favor of Anne Shirley. Ethel Marr was\nadmitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes\nof hair-dressing, and Jane Andrews--plain, plodding, conscientious\nJane--carried off the honors in the domestic science course. Even Josie\nPye attained a certain preeminence as the sharpest-tongued young lady in\nattendance at Queen's. So it may be fairly stated that Miss Stacy's old\npupils held their own in the wider arena of the academical course.\nAnne worked hard and steadily. Her rivalry with Gilbert was as intense\nas it had ever been in Avonlea school, although it was not known in the\nclass at large, but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it. Anne no\nlonger wished to win for the sake of defeating Gilbert; rather, for the\nproud consciousness of a well-won victory over a worthy foeman.

Surely he was much grayer than he had been a year\nbefore.\n\"Marilla,\" she said hesitatingly when he had gone out, \"is Matthew quite\nwell?\"\n\"No, he isn't,\" said Marilla in a troubled tone. \"He's had some real\nbad spells with his heart this spring and he won't spare himself a mite.\nI've been real worried about him, but he's some better this while back\nand we've got a good hired man, so I'm hoping he'll kind of rest and\npick up. Maybe he will now you're home. You always cheer him up.\"\nAnne leaned across the table and took Marilla's face in her hands.\n\"You are not looking as well yourself as I'd like to see you, Marilla.\nYou look tired. I'm afraid you've been working too hard. You must take\na rest, now that I'm home. I'm just going to take this one day off to\nvisit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and then it will\nbe your turn to be lazy while I do the work.\"\nMarilla smiled affectionately at her girl.\n\"It's not the work--it's my head. I've got a pain so often now--behind\nmy eyes. Doctor Spencer's been fussing with glasses, but they don't do\nme any good. There is a distinguished oculist coming to the Island the\nlast of June and the doctor says I must see him. I guess I'll have to.\nI can't read or sew with any comfort now. Well, Anne, you've done real\nwell at Queen's I must say. To take First Class License in one year and\nwin the Avery scholarship--well, well, Mrs. Lynde says pride goes before\na fall and she doesn't believe in the higher education of women at all;\nshe says it unfits them for woman's true sphere. I don't believe a word\nof it. Speaking of Rachel reminds me--did you hear anything about the\nAbbey Bank lately, Anne?\"\n\"I heard it was shaky,\" answered Anne. \"Why?\"\n\"That is what Rachel said. She was up here one day last week and said\nthere was some talk about it. Matthew felt real worried. All we have\nsaved is in that bank--every penny. I wanted Matthew to put it in the\nSavings Bank in the first place, but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of\nfather's and he'd always banked with him. Matthew said any bank with him\nat the head of it was good enough for anybody.\"\n\"I think he has only been its nominal head for many years,\" said\nAnne. \"He is a very old man; his nephews are really at the head of the\ninstitution.\"\n\"Well, when Rachel told us that, I wanted Matthew to draw our money\nright out and he said he'd think of it.

He says that if I give up all\nreading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes,\nand if I'm careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he's given me\nhe thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured.\nBut if I don't he says I'll certainly be stone-blind in six months.\nBlind! Anne, just think of it!\"\nFor a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was\nsilent. It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak. Then she said\nbravely, but with a catch in her voice:\n\"Marilla, _don't_ think of it. You know he has given you hope. If you are\ncareful you won't lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure\nyour headaches it will be a great thing.\"\n\"I don't call it much hope,\" said Marilla bitterly. \"What am I to live\nfor if I can't read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well\nbe blind--or dead. And as for crying, I can't help that when I get\nlonesome. But there, it's no good talking about it. If you'll get me\na cup of tea I'll be thankful. I'm about done out. Don't say anything\nabout this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can't bear that folks\nshould come here to question and sympathize and talk about it.\"\nWhen Marilla had eaten her lunch Anne persuaded her to go to bed. Then\nAnne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the\ndarkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart. How sadly\nthings had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home!\nThen she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy\nwith promise. Anne felt as if she had lived years since then, but before\nshe went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.\nShe had looked her duty courageously in the face and found it a\nfriend--as duty ever is when we meet it frankly.\nOne afternoon a few days later Marilla came slowly in from the front\nyard where she had been talking to a caller--a man whom Anne knew by\nsight as Sadler from Carmody. Anne wondered what he could have been\nsaying to bring that look to Marilla's face.\n\"What did Mr. Sadler want, Marilla?\"\nMarilla sat down by the window and looked at Anne. There were tears in\nher eyes in defiance of the oculist's prohibition and her voice broke as\nshe said:\n\"He heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy it.\"\n\"Buy it! Buy Green Gables?\" Anne wondered if she had heard aright. \"Oh,\nMarilla, you don't mean to sell Green Gables!\"\n\"Anne, I don't know what else is to be done. I've thought it all over.\nIf my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after\nthings and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can't. I may\nlose my sight altogether; and anyway I'll not be fit to run things. Oh,\nI never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd have to sell my home.\nBut things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till\nnobody would want to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank;\nand there's some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay. Mrs. Lynde advises\nme to sell the farm and board somewhere--with her I suppose. It won't\nbring much--it's small and the buildings are old. But it'll be enough\nfor me to live on I reckon. I'm thankful you're provided for with that\nscholarship, Anne. I'm sorry you won't have a home to come to in your\nvacations, that's all, but I suppose you'll manage somehow.\"\nMarilla broke down and wept bitterly.\n\"You mustn't sell Green Gables,\" said Anne resolutely.\n\"Oh, Anne, I wish I didn't have to. But you can see for yourself. I\ncan't stay here alone. I'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my\nsight would go--I know it would.\"\n\"You won't have to stay here alone, Marilla. I'll be with you. I'm not\ngoing to Redmond.\"\n\"Not going to Redmond!\" Marilla lifted her worn face from her hands and\nlooked at Anne. \"Why, what do you mean?\"\n\"Just what I say. I'm not going to take the scholarship. I decided so\nthe night after you came home from town. You surely don't think I could\nleave you alone in your trouble, Marilla, after all you've done for me.\nI've been thinking and planning. Let me tell you my plans. Mr. Barry\nwants to rent the farm for next year. So you won't have any bother over\nthat. And I'm going to teach. I've applied for the school here--but I\ndon't expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to\nGilbert Blythe. But I can have the Carmody school--Mr. Blair told me\nso last night at the store. Of course that won't be quite as nice or\nconvenient as if I had the Avonlea school. But I can board home and\ndrive myself over to Carmody and back, in the warm weather at least. And\neven in winter I can come home Fridays. We'll keep a horse for that. Oh,\nI have it all planned out, Marilla. And I'll read to you and keep you\ncheered up. You sha'n't be dull or lonesome. And we'll be real cozy and\nhappy here together, you and I.\"\nMarilla had listened like a woman in a dream.\n\"Oh, Anne, I could get on real well if you were here, I know. But I\ncan't let you sacrifice yourself so for me. It would be terrible.\"\n\"Nonsense!\" Anne laughed merrily. \"There is no sacrifice. Nothing could\nbe worse than giving up Green Gables--nothing could hurt me more. We\nmust keep the dear old place. My mind is quite made up, Marilla. I'm _not_\ngoing to Redmond; and I _am_ going to stay here and teach. Don't you worry\nabout me a bit.\"\n\"But your ambitions--and--\"",

Most of the good folks, not\nknowing about Marilla's eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did\nnot. She told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure\nto the girl's eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening\nand found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,\nscented summer dusk. They liked to sit there when the twilight came down\nand the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled\nthe dewy air.\nMrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the\ndoor, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a\nlong breath of mingled weariness and relief.\n\"I declare I'm getting glad to sit down. I've been on my feet all day,\nand two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It's\na great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well,\nAnne, I hear you've given up your notion of going to college. I was\nreal glad to hear it. You've got as much education now as a woman can be\ncomfortable with. I don't believe in girls going to college with the men\nand cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.\"\n\"But I'm going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde,\" said\nAnne laughing. \"I'm going to take my Arts course right here at Green\nGables, and study everything that I would at college.\"\nMrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.\n\"Anne Shirley, you'll kill yourself.\"\n\"Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I'm not going to overdo\nthings. As 'Josiah Allen's wife,' says, I shall be 'mejum'. But I'll\nhave lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I've no\nvocation for fancy work. I'm going to teach over at Carmody, you know.\"\n\"I don't know it. I guess you're going to teach right here in Avonlea.\nThe trustees have decided to give you the school.\"\n\"Mrs. Lynde!\" cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. \"Why, I\nthought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!\"\n\"So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it\nhe went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night,\nyou know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested\nthat they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of\ncourse he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must\nsay I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real\nself-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands,\nand everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the\ntrustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came\nhome and told me.\"\n\"I don't feel that I ought to take it,\" murmured Anne. \"I mean--I don't\nthink I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me.\"\n\"I guess you can't prevent him now. He's signed papers with the White\nSands trustees. So it wouldn't do him any good now if you were to\nrefuse. Of course you'll take the school. You'll get along all right,",
