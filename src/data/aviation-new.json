During this early period, the concepts of lift, stability, and\ncontrol were not well understood, and most attempts resulted in serious\ninjuries or death.\nThe Andalusian scientist Abbas ibn Firnas (810\u2013887 AD) attempted to fly in\nC\u00f3rdoba, Spain, by covering his body with vulture feathers and attached two\nwings to his arms. The 17th-century Algerian historian Ahmed Mohammed\nal-Maqqari, quoting a poem by Muhammad I of C\u00f3rdoba's 9th-century court poet\nMu'min ibn Said, recounts that Firnas flew some distance before landing with\nsome injuries, attributed to his lacking a tail (as birds use them to land). In\nthe 12th century, William of Malmesbury wrote that Eilmer of Malmesbury, an\n11th-century Benedictine monk, attached wings to his hands and feet and flew a\nshort distance, but broke both legs while landing, also having neglected to\nmake himself a tail.\nMany others made well-documented jumps in the following centuries. As late as\n1811, Albrecht Berblinger constructed an ornithopter and jumped into the Danube\nat Ulm.",

Most notable of these was Leonardo da Vinci,\nalthough his work remained unknown until 1797, and so had no influence on\ndevelopments over the next three hundred years. While his designs are rational,\nthey are not scientific. He particularly underestimated the amount of power\nthat would be needed to propel a flying object, basing his designs on the\nflapping wings of a bird rather than an engine-powered propeller.\nLeonardo studied bird and bat flight, claiming the superiority of the latter\nowing to its unperforated wing. He analyzed these and anticipated many\nprinciples of aerodynamics. He understood that \"An object offers as much\nresistance to the air as the air does to the object.\" Isaac Newton later\ndefined this as the third law of motion in 1687.\nFrom the last years of the 15th century until 1505, Leonardo wrote about and\nsketched many designs for flying machines and mechanisms, including\nornithopters, fixed-wing gliders, rotorcraft (perhaps inspired by whirligig\ntoys), parachutes (in the form of a wooden-framed pyramidal tent) and a wind\nspeed gauge. His early designs were man-powered and included ornithopters and\nrotorcraft; however, he came to realise the impracticality of this and later\nturned to controlled gliding flight, also sketching some designs powered by a\nspring.\nIn an essay titled Sul volo (On flight), Leonardo describes a flying machine\ncalled \"the bird\" which he built from starched linen, leather joints, and raw\nsilk thongs. In the Codex Atlanticus, he wrote, \"Tomorrow morning, on the\nsecond day of January 1496, I will make the thong and the attempt.\" According\nto one commonly repeated, albeit presumably fictional story, in 1505 Leonardo\nor one of his pupils attempted to fly from the summit of Monte Ceceri.",

      "text": "Airships were originally called \"dirigible balloons\" and are still sometimes\ncalled dirigibles today.\nWork on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon continued sporadically\nthroughout the 19th century. The first powered, controlled, sustained\nlighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place in 1852 when Henri\nGiffard flew 15 miles (24\u00a0km) in France, with a steam engine-driven craft.\nAnother advancement was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable\nfree-flight was made in a French Army electric-powered airship, La France, by\nCharles Renard and Arthur Krebs. The 170-foot (52\u00a0m) long, 66,000-cubic-foot\n(1,900\u00a0m3) airship covered 8\u00a0km (5.0\u00a0mi) in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8\u00bd\nhorsepower electric motor.\nHowever, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail.\nRoutine, controlled flights did not occur until the advent of the internal\ncombustion engine.\nThe first aircraft to make routine controlled flights were non-rigid airships\n(sometimes called \"blimps\".) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this\ntype of aircraft was the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont who effectively\ncombined a balloon with an internal combustion engine. On 19 October 1901, he\nflew his airship Number 6 over Paris from the Parc de Saint Cloud around the\nEiffel Tower and back in under 30 minutes to win the Deutsch de la Meurthe\nprize. Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft. The\nsubsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard\nto aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.\nAt the same time that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success,\nthe first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These were far\nmore capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo-carrying capacity\nfor decades. Rigid airship design and advancement was pioneered by the German\ncount Ferdinand von Zeppelin.\nConstruction of the first Zeppelin airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly\nhall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell, Friedrichshafen. This was\nintended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall could easily be aligned\nwith the wind. The prototype airship LZ 1 (LZ for \"Luftschiff Zeppelin\") had a\nlength of 128\u00a0m (420\u00a0ft), was driven by two 10.6\u00a0kW (14.2\u00a0hp) Daimler engines\nand balanced by moving a weight between its two nacelles.\nIts first flight, on 2 July 1900, lasted for only 18 minutes, as LZ 1 was\nforced to land on the lake after the winding mechanism for the balancing weight\nhad broken. Upon repair, the technology proved its potential in subsequent\nflights, bettering the 6\u00a0m/s speed attained by the French airship La France by\n3\u00a0m/s, but could not yet convince possible investors. It was several years\nbefore the Count was able to raise enough funds for another try.\nThe German airship passenger service known as DELAG (Deutsche-Luftschiffahrts\nAG) was established in 1910.\nAlthough airships were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a\nlimited basis to this day, their development has been largely overshadowed by\nheavier-than-air craft.",

During\nthe last years of the 18th century, he had begun the first rigorous study of\nthe physics of flight and would later design the first modern heavier-than-air\ncraft. Among his many achievements, his most important contributions to\naeronautics include:\nCayley's research on the aeroplane aimed to address the four fundamental areas\nthat are essential to aeronautics: propulsion, structural design, aerodynamics,\nand stability and control. His work laid the groundwork for a comprehensive\nunderstanding of these critical components, which continue to be vital in the\nfield today.\nCayley's first innovation was to study the basic science of lift by adopting\nthe whirling arm test rig for use in aircraft research and using simple\naerodynamic models on the arm, rather than attempting to fly a model of a\ncomplete design.\nIn 1799, he set down the concept of the modern aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying\nmachine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.\nIn 1804, Cayley constructed a model glider, which was the first modern\nheavier-than-air flying machine. It had the layout of a conventional modern\naircraft, with an inclined wing towards the front and an adjustable tail at the\nback with both tailplane and fin. A movable weight allowed adjustment of the\nmodel's centre of gravity.\nIn 1809, goaded by the farcical antics of his contemporaries, he began the\npublication of a landmark three-part treatise titled \"On Aerial Navigation\"\n(1809\u20131810). In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, \"The\nwhole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a\ngiven weight by the application of power to the resistance of air\". He\nidentified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: thrust, lift,\ndrag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs. He also\nidentified and described the importance of the cambered aerofoil, dihedral,\ndiagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and\ndesign of ornithopters and parachutes.",

Although only a design, it was the first in history\nfor a propeller-driven fixed-wing aircraft.\n1866 saw the founding of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain and two\nyears later the world's first aeronautical exhibition was held at the Crystal\nPalace, London, where John Stringfellow was awarded a \u00a3100 prize for the steam\nengine with the best power-to-weight ratio. In 1848, Stringfellow achieved the\nfirst powered flight using an unmanned 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) wingspan steam-powered\nmonoplane built in a disused lace factory in Chard, Somerset. Employing two\ncontra-rotating propellers on the first attempt, made indoors, the machine flew\nten feet before becoming destabilised, damaging the craft. The second attempt\nwas more successful, the machine leaving a guidewire to fly freely, achieving\nthirty yards of straight and level powered flight. Francis Herbert Wenham\npresented the first paper to the newly formed Aeronautical Society (later the\nRoyal Aeronautical Society), On Aerial Locomotion. He advanced Cayley's work on\ncambered wings, making important findings. To test his ideas, from 1858 he had\nconstructed several gliders, both manned and unmanned, and with up to five\nstacked wings. He realised that long, thin wings are better than bat-like ones\nbecause they have more leading edge for their area. Today this relationship is\nknown as the aspect ratio of a wing.\nThe latter part of the 19th century became a period of intense study,\ncharacterized by the \"gentleman scientists\" who represented most research\nefforts until the 20th century. Among them was the British\nscientist-philosopher and inventor Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, who studied\nlateral flight control and was the first to patent an aileron control system in\n1868.\nIn 1871, Wenham made the first wind tunnel using a fan, driven by a steam\nengine, to propel air down a 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) tube to the model.\nMeanwhile, the British advances had galvanised French researchers. In 1857,\nF\u00e9lix du Temple proposed a monoplane with a tailplane and retractable\nundercarriage. Developing his ideas with a model powered first by clockwork and\nlater by steam, he eventually achieved a short hop with a full-size manned\ncraft in 1874. It achieved lift-off under its own power after launching from a\nramp, glided for a short time and returned safely to the ground, making it the\nfirst successful powered glide in history.",

      "text": "In 1865, Louis Pierre Mouillard published an influential book The Empire Of The\nAir (l'Empire de l'Air).\nIn 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Bris made the first flight higher than his\npoint of departure, by having his glider \"L'Albatros artificiel\" pulled by a\nhorse on a beach. He reportedly achieved a height of 100 metres, over a\ndistance of 200 metres.\nAlphonse P\u00e9naud, a Frenchman, advanced the theory of wing contours and\naerodynamics. He also constructed successful models of aeroplanes, helicopters\nand ornithopters. In 1871 he flew the first aerodynamically stable fixed-wing\naeroplane, a model monoplane he called the \"Planophore\", a distance of 40\u00a0m\n(130\u00a0ft). P\u00e9naud's model incorporated several of Cayley's discoveries,\nincluding the use of a tail, wing dihedral for inherent stability, and rubber\npower. The planophore also had longitudinal stability, being trimmed such that\nthe tailplane was set at a smaller angle of incidence than the wings, an\noriginal and important contribution to the theory of aeronautics. P\u00e9naud's\nlater project for an amphibian aeroplane, although never built, incorporated\nother modern features. A tailless monoplane with a single vertical fin and twin\ntractor propellers, it also featured hinged rear elevator and rudder surfaces,\nretractable undercarriage and a fully enclosed, instrumented cockpit.\nAnother theorist was Frenchman Victor Tatin. In 1879, he flew a model which,\nlike P\u00e9naud's project, was a monoplane with twin tractor propellers but also\nhad a separate horizontal tail. It was powered by compressed air. Flown\ntethered to a pole, this was the first model to take off under its own power.\nIn 1884, Alexandre Goupil published his work La Locomotion A\u00e9rienne (Aerial\nLocomotion), although the flying machine he later constructed failed to fly.\nIn 1890, the French engineer Cl\u00e9ment Ader completed the first of three\nsteam-driven flying machines, the \u00c9ole. On 9 October 1890, Ader made an\nuncontrolled hop of around 50 metres (160\u00a0ft); this was the first manned\naeroplane to take off under its own power. His Avion III of 1897, notable only\nfor having twin steam engines, failed to fly: Ader later claimed success and\nwas not debunked until 1910 when the French Army published its report on his\nattempt.\nHiram Maxim was an American engineer who had moved to England. He built his own\nwhirling arm rig and wind tunnel and constructed a large machine with a\nwingspan of 105 feet (32\u00a0m), a length of 145 feet (44\u00a0m), fore and aft\nhorizontal surfaces and a crew of three. Twin propellers were powered by two\nlightweight compound steam engines each delivering 180\u00a0hp (130\u00a0kW). The overall\nweight was 8,000 pounds (3,600\u00a0kg). It was intended as a test rig to\ninvestigate aerodynamic lift; because it lacked flight controls it ran on\nrails, with a second set of rails above the wheels to restrain it. Completed in\n1894, on its third run it broke from the rail, became airborne for about 200\nyards at two to three feet of altitude and was badly damaged upon falling back\nto the ground. It was subsequently repaired, but Maxim abandoned his",

      "text": "Around the last decade of the 19th century, a number of key figures were\nrefining and defining the modern aeroplane. Lacking a suitable engine, aircraft\nwork focused on stability and control in gliding flight. In 1879, Biot\nconstructed a bird-like glider with the help of Massia and flew in it briefly.\nIt is preserved in the Musee de l'Air, France, and is claimed to be the\nearliest man-carrying flying machine still in existence.\nThe Englishman Horatio Phillips made key contributions to aerodynamics. He\nconducted extensive wind tunnel research on aerofoil sections, proving the\nprinciples of aerodynamic lift foreseen by Cayley and Wenham. His findings\nunderpin all modern aerofoil design. Between 1883 and 1886, the American John\nJoseph Montgomery developed a series of three manned gliders, before conducting\nhis own independent investigations into aerodynamics and circulation of lift.\nOtto Lilienthal became known as the \"Glider King\" or \"Flying Man\" of Germany.\nHe duplicated Wenham's work and greatly expanded on it in 1884, publishing his\nresearch in 1889 as Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation (Der Vogelflug als\nGrundlage der Fliegekunst), which is seen as one of the most important works in\naviation history. He also produced a series of hang gliders, including\nbat-wing, monoplane, and biplane forms, such as the Derwitzer Glider and Normal\nsoaring apparatus, which is considered to be the first airplane in series\nproduction, making the \"Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal\" the first airplane\nproduction company in the world.\nStarting in 1891, he became the first person to make controlled untethered\nglides routinely, and the first to be photographed flying a heavier-than-air\nmachine, stimulating interest around the world. Lilienthal's work led to him\ndeveloping the concept of the modern wing. His flights in the year 1891 are\nseen as the beginning of human flight and because of that he is often referred\nto as either the \"father of aviation\" or \"father of flight\".\nHe rigorously documented his work, including photographs, and for this reason\nis one of the best known of the early pioneers. Lilienthal made over 2,000\nglider flights until his death in 1896 from injuries sustained in a glider\ncrash.",

Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher\naspect ratio and true three-axis control. They flew it successfully hundreds of\ntimes in 1902, and it performed far better than the previous models.

Almost as an afterthought, they designed and\nbuilt a low-powered internal combustion engine. They also designed and carved\nwooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling them to\ngain adequate performance from their low engine power. Although wing-warping as\na means of lateral control was used only briefly during the early history of\naviation, the principle of combining lateral control in combination with a\nrudder was a key advance in aircraft control. While many aviation pioneers\nappeared to leave safety largely to chance, the Wrights' design was greatly\ninfluenced by the need to teach themselves to fly without unreasonable risk to\nlife and limb, by surviving crashes. This emphasis, as well as low engine\npower, was the reason for low flying speed and for taking off in a headwind.\nPerformance, rather than safety, was the reason for the rear-heavy design\nbecause the canard could not be highly loaded; anhedral wings were less\naffected by crosswinds and were consistent with the low yaw stability.",

On 23 June 1905, they first flew a third machine, the Flyer\nIII. After a severe crash on 14 July 1905, they rebuilt the Flyer III and made\nimportant design changes. They almost doubled the size of the elevator and\nrudder and moved them about twice the distance from the wings. They added two\nfixed vertical vanes (called \"blinkers\") between the elevators and gave the\nwings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the rudder from the\nwing-warping control, and as in all future aircraft, placed it on a separate\ncontrol handle. When flights resumed the results were immediate. The serious\npitch instability that hampered Flyers I and II was significantly reduced, so\nrepeated minor crashes were eliminated. Flights with the redesigned Flyer III\nstarted lasting over 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. Flyer III became the first\npractical aircraft (though without wheels and needing a launching device),\nflying consistently under full control and bringing its pilot back to the\nstarting point safely and landing without damage.

He was followed by Jacob Ellehammer who built a\nmonoplane which he tested with a tether in Denmark on 12 September 1906, flying\n42 metres.\nOn 13 September 1906, the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont made a public flight\nin Paris with the 14-bis, also known as Oiseau de proie (French for \"bird of\nprey\"). This was canard configured with a pronounced wing dihedral, and covered\na distance of 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) on the grounds of the Chateau de Bagatelle in\nParis' Bois de Boulogne before a large crowd of witnesses. This well-documented\nevent was the first flight verified by the A\u00e9ro-Club de France of a powered\nheavier-than-air machine in Europe and won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the\nfirst officially observed flight greater than 25\u00a0m (82\u00a0ft). On 12 November\n1906, Santos-Dumont set the first world record recognized by the Federation\nAeronautique Internationale by flying 220\u00a0m (720\u00a0ft) in 21.5\u00a0seconds. Only one\nmore brief flight was made by the 14-bis in March 1907, after which it was\nabandoned.",

His final design, first flown in 1907, was the series of\nDemoiselle monoplanes (Nos. 19 to 22). The Demoiselle No 19 could be\nconstructed in only 15 days and became the world's first series production\naircraft. The Demoiselle achieved 120\u00a0km/h. The fuselage consisted of three\nspecially reinforced bamboo booms. The pilot sat in a seat between the main\nwheels of a conventional landing gear whose pair of wire-spoked mainwheels were\nlocated at the lower front of the airframe, with a tailskid half-way back\nbeneath the rear fuselage structure. The Demoiselle was controlled in flight by\na cruciform tail unit hinged on a form of universal joint at the aft end of the\nfuselage structure to function as elevator and rudder, with roll control\nprovided through wing warping (No. 20), with the wings only warping \"down\".\nIn 1908, Wilbur Wright travelled to Europe, and starting in August gave a\nseries of flight demonstrations at Le Mans in France. The first demonstration,\nmade on 8 August, attracted an audience including most of the major French\naviation experimenters, who were astonished by the clear superiority of the\nWright Brothers' aircraft, particularly its ability to make tight controlled\nturns. The importance of using roll control in making turns was recognised by\nalmost all the European experimenters: Henri Farman fitted ailerons to his\nVoisin biplane and shortly afterwards set up his own aircraft construction\nbusiness, whose first product was the influential Farman III biplane.\nThe following year saw the widespread recognition of powered flight as\nsomething other than the preserve of dreamers and eccentrics. On 25 July 1909,\nLouis Bl\u00e9riot won worldwide fame by winning a \u00a31,000 prize offered by the\nBritish Daily Mail newspaper for a flight across the English Channel, and in\nAugust around half a million people, including the President of France Armand\nFalli\u00e8res and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George,\nattended one of the first aviation meetings, the Grande Semaine d'Aviation at\nReims.\nIn 1914, pioneering aviator Tony Jannus captained the inaugural flight of the\nSt. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, the world's first commercial passenger\nairline.\nHistorians disagree about whether the Wright brothers patent war impeded\ndevelopment of the aviation industry in the United States compared to Europe.\nThe patent war ended during World War I when the government pressured the\nindustry into forming a patent pool, and major litigants had left the industry.",

Air combat tactics and doctrines started being rapidly developed.\nLarge-scale strategic bombing campaigns were launched, fighter escorts\nintroduced and the more flexible aircraft and weapons allowed precise attacks\non small targets with dive bombers, fighter-bombers, and ground-attack\naircraft. New technologies like radar also allowed more coordinated and\ncontrolled deployment of air defence.\nThe first jet aircraft to fly was the Heinkel He 178 (Germany), flown by Erich\nWarsitz in 1939, followed by the world's first operational jet aircraft, the\nMesserschmitt Me 262, in July 1942 and world's first jet-powered bomber, the\nArado Ar 234, in June 1943. British developments, like the Gloster Meteor,\nfollowed afterwards, but saw only brief use in World War II. The first cruise\nmissile (V-1), the first ballistic missile (V-2), the first (and to date only)\noperational rocket-powered combat aircraft Me 163\u2014which attained velocities of\nup to 1,130\u00a0km/h (700\u00a0mph) in test flights\u2014and the first vertical take-off a\nmanned point-defence interceptor, the Bachem Ba 349 Natter, were also developed\nby Germany. However, jet and rocket aircraft had only limited impact due to\ntheir late introduction, fuel shortages, the lack of experienced pilots and the\ndeclining war industry of Germany.\nNot only aeroplanes, but also helicopters saw rapid development in the Second\nWorld War, with the introduction of the Focke Achgelis Fa 223, the Flettner Fl\n282 synchropter in 1941 in Germany and the Sikorsky R-4 in 1942 in the USA.",

There was an excess\nof large bombers, such as the B-29 and Lancaster, which were easily converted\nfor commercial use. The DC-3 specifically played a key role, enabling longer\nand more efficient flights.\nThe British de Havilland Comet became the first commercial jet airliner and was\nintroduced into scheduled service by 1952. The aircraft was a breakthrough in\ntechnical achievements, but had several intense failures. The square design of\nthe windows caused stress cracks from metal fatigue, caused by cycles of cabin\npressurization and depressurization. This eventually led to severe structural\nfailures in the fuel area. These issues were resolved too late, since competing\njet airliners were already flying.\nOn 15 September 1956, the USSR's airline Aeroflot\u00a0became the first to offer\ncontinuous, regular jet services using the Tupolev Tu-104. Soon after, Boeing\n707 and\u00a0DC-8 also set new standards in comfort, safety, and passenger\nexperience.

Additionally,\nmuch of the developing world that did not have good access to air transport has\nbeen steadily adding aircraft and facilities; though severe congestion remains\na problem in many up and coming nations. Around 20,000 city pairs are served by\ncommercial aviation, up from less than 10,000 as recently as 1996.\nThere appears to be newfound interest in returning to the supersonic era\nwhereby waning demand in the turn of the 20th century made flights\nunprofitable, as well as the final commercial stoppage of the Concorde due to\nreduced demand following a fatal accident and rising costs.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, digital technology allowed subsonic\nmilitary aviation to begin eliminating the pilot in favour of remotely operated\nor completely autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In April 2001, the\nunmanned aircraft Global Hawk flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia\nnon-stop and un-refuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever\nundertaken by an unmanned aircraft and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October\n2003, the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a\ncomputer-controlled model aircraft occurred. UAVs are now an established\nfeature of modern warfare, carrying out pinpoint attacks under the control of a\nremote operator.",

He subsequently succeeded in crossing the English\nChannel on his device on 4 August 2019, covering the 35-kilometre (22\u00a0mi)\njourney from Sangatte in northern France to St Margaret's Bay in Kent, UK, in\n22 minutes, with a midpoint fueling stop included.\n24 July 2019 was the busiest day in aviation, Flightradar24 recorded a total of\nover 225,000 flights that day. It includes helicopters, private jets, gliders,\nsight-seeing flights, as well as personal aircraft.\nOn 10 June 2020, the Pipistrel Velis Electro became the first electric\naeroplane to secure a type certificate from EASA.\nIn the early 21st Century, the first fifth-generation military fighters were\nproduced, starting with the F-22 Raptor. As of 2019, Russia, America and China\nhave 5th gen aircraft.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to\nthe resulting travel restrictions as well as slump in demand among travellers,\nand may also affect the future of air travel.
