But Montague is bound as well as I,\nIn penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace.\nPar. Of honourable reckoning are you both,\nAnd pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.\nBut now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\nCap. But saying o'er what I have said before:\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world,\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\nLet two more summers wither in their pride\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.\nPar. Younger than she are happy mothers made.\nCap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.\nThe earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth.\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;\nMy will to her consent is but a part.\nAn she agree, within her scope of choice\nLies my consent and fair according voice.\nThis night I hold an old accustom'd feast,\nWhereto I have invited many a guest,\nSuch as I love; and you among the store,\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more.\nAt my poor house look to behold this night\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\nWhen well apparell'd April on the heel\nOf limping Winter treads, even such delight\nAmong fresh female buds shall you this night\nInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\nAnd like her most whose merit most shall be;\nWhich, on more view of many, mine, being one,\nMay stand in number, though in reck'ning none.\nCome, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,\nsirrah,\ntrudge about\nThrough fair Verona; find those persons out\nWhose names are written there, and to them say,\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay-\nExeunt [Capulet and Paris].\nServ. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written\nthat the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor\nwith his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter\nwith\nhis nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are\nhere writ, and can never find what names the writing person\nhath\nhere writ. I must to the learned. In good time!\nEnter Benvolio and Romeo.\nBen. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;\nOne pain is lessened by another's anguish;\nTurn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\nOne desperate grief cures with another's languish.\nTake thou some new infection to thy eye,\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die.\nRom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.\nBen. For what, I pray thee?\nRom. For your broken shin.\nBen. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?\nRom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;\nShut up in prison, kept without my food,\nWhipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.\nServ. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\nRom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.\nServ. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can\nyou\nread anything you see?\nRom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.\nServ. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!\nRom. Stay, fellow; I can read. He reads.\n'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\nCounty Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\nThe lady widow of Vitruvio;\nSignior Placentio and His lovely nieces;\nMercutio and his brother Valentine;\nMine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;\nMy fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\nSignior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;\nLucio and the lively Helena.'\n[Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they\ncome?\nServ. Up.\nRom. Whither?\nServ. To supper, to our house.\nRom. Whose house?\nServ. My master's.\nRom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.\nServ. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great\nrich\nCapulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray\ncome\nand crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! Exit.\nBen. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's\nSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;\nWith all the admired beauties of Verona.\nGo thither, and with unattainted eye\nCompare her face with some that I shall show,\nAnd I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\nRom. When the devout religion of mine eye\nMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;\nAnd these, who, often drown'd, could never die,\nTransparent heretics, be burnt for liars!\nOne fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\nNe'er saw her match since first the world begun.\nBen. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,\nHerself pois'd with herself in either eye;\nBut in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd\nYour lady's love against some other maid\nThat I will show you shining at this feast,\nAnd she shall scant show well that now seems best.\nRom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,\nBut to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.]\nScene III.\nCapulet's house.\nEnter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.\nWife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.\nNurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,\nI bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!\nGod forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!\nEnter Juliet.\nJul. How now? Who calls?\nNurse. Your mother.\nJul. Madam, I am here.\nWhat is your will?\nWife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,\nWe must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;\nI have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.\nThou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.\nNurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\nWife. She's not fourteen.\nNurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-\nAnd yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-\nShe is not fourteen. How long is it now\nTo Lammastide?\nWife. A fortnight and odd days.\nNurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,\nCome Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\nSusan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\nWere of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\nShe was too good for me. But, as I said,\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\nThat shall she, marry; I remember it well.\n'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\nAnd she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day;\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua.\nNay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\nTo see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\nShake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,\nTo bid me trudge.\nAnd since that time it is eleven years,\nFor then she could stand alone; nay, by th' rood,\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\nFor even the day before, she broke her brow;\nAnd then my husband (God be with his soul!\n'A was a merry man) took up the child.\n'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\nWilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,\nThe pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'\nTo see now how a jest shall come about!\nI warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,\nI never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,\nAnd, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'\nWife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.\nNurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh\nTo think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'\nAnd yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow\nA bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;\nA perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.\n'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\nWilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'\nJul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\nNurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\nThou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.\nAn I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\nWife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme\nI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\nHow stands your disposition to be married?\nJul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\nNurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,\nI would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.\nWife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\nAre made already mothers. By my count,\nI was your mother much upon these years\nThat you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\nNurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man\nAs all the world- why he's a man of wax.\nWife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.\nNurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.\nWife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\nThis night you shall behold him at our feast.\nRead o'er the volume of young Paris' face,\nAnd find delight writ there with beauty's pen;\nExamine every married lineament,\nAnd see how one another lends content;\nAnd what obscur'd in this fair volume lies\nFind written in the margent of his eyes,\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover,\nTo beautify him only lacks a cover.\nThe fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride\nFor fair without the fair within to hide.\nThat book in many's eyes doth share the glory,\nThat in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess,\nBy having him making yourself no less.\nNurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men\nWife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?\nJul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.\nEnter Servingman.\nServ. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,\nmy\nyoung lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and\neverything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you\nfollow straight.\nWife. We follow thee. Exit [Servingman].\nJuliet, the County stays.\nNurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\nExeunt.",

What light through yonder window breaks?\nIt is the East, and Juliet is the sun!\nArise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\nWho is already sick and pale with grief\nThat thou her maid art far more fair than she.\nBe not her maid, since she is envious.\nHer vestal livery is but sick and green,\nAnd none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.\nIt is my lady; O, it is my love!\nO that she knew she were!\nShe speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\nHer eye discourses; I will answer it.\nI am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\nWhat if her eyes were there, they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\nO that I were a glove upon that hand,\nThat I might touch that cheek!\nJul. Ah me!\nRom. She speaks.\nO, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\nAs glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\nAs is a winged messenger of heaven\nUnto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes\nOf mortals that fall back to gaze on him\nWhen he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds\nAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.\nJul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name!\nOr, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I'll no longer be a Capulet.\nRom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\nJul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\nWhat's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\nBelonging to a man. O, be some other name!\nWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose\nBy any other name would smell as sweet.\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name;\nAnd for that name, which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself.\nRom. I take thee at thy word.\nCall me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\nJul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\nRom. By a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am.\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\nBecause it is an enemy to thee.\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\nJul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\nOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.\nArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\nRom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\nJul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\nRom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\nAnd what love can do, that dares love attempt.\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\nJul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.\nRom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye\nThan twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,\nAnd I am proof against their enmity.\nJul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.\nRom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here.\nMy life were better ended by their hate\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\nJul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?\nRom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\nI am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\nAs that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,\nI would adventure for such merchandise.\nJul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.\nFain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny\nWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment!\nDost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,\nThey say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\nOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\nI'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;\nBut trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,\nMy true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\nRom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-\nJul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\nRom. What shall I swear by?\nJul. Do not swear at all;\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I'll believe thee.\nRom. If my heart's dear love-\nJul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract to-night.\nIt is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!\nThis bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\nMay prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.\nGood night, good night! As sweet repose and rest\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast!\nRom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\nJul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\nRom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.\nJul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\nRom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\nJul. But to be frank and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have.\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\nI hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!\n[Nurse] calls within.\nAnon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\nStay but a little, I will come again. [Exit.]\nRom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,\nToo flattering-sweet to be substantial.\nEnter Juliet above.\nJul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\nThy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\nBy one that I'll procure to come to thee,\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\nNurse. (within) Madam!\nJul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,\nI do beseech thee-\nNurse. (within) Madam!\nJul. By-and-by I come.-\nTo cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.\nTo-morrow will I send.\nRom. So thrive my soul-\nJul. A thousand times good night! Exit.\nRom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!\nLove goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;\nBut love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\nEnter Juliet again, [above].\nJul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again!\nBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\nWith repetition of my Romeo's name.\nRomeo!\nRom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,\nLike softest music to attending ears!\nJul. Romeo!\nRom. My dear?\nJul. At what o'clock to-morrow\nShall I send to thee?\nRom. By the hour of nine.\nJul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\nRom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.\nJul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\nRememb'ring how I love thy company.\nRom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,\nForgetting any other home but this.\nJul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton's bird,\nThat lets it hop a little from her hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\nRom. I would I were thy bird.\nJul. Sweet, so would I.\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\nGood night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\n[Exit.]\nRom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!\nHence will I to my ghostly father's cell,\nHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\nExit\nScene III.",

Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\nBen. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\nMer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I\nwas\ncome to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to\noccupy\nthe argument no longer.\nRom. Here's goodly gear!\nEnter Nurse and her Man [Peter].\nMer. A sail, a sail!\nBen. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.\nNurse. Peter!\nPeter. Anon.\nNurse. My fan, Peter.\nMer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer\nface of\nthe two.\nNurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.\nMer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\nNurse. Is it good-den?\nMer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is\nnow\nupon the prick of noon.\nNurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!\nRom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\nNurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'\nquoth\n'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the\nyoung\nRomeo?\nRom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you\nhave\nfound him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest\nof\nthat name, for fault of a worse.\nNurse. You say well.\nMer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,\nwisely.\nNurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\nBen. She will endite him to some supper.\nMer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\nRom. What hast thou found?\nMer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is\nsomething stale and hoar ere it be spent\nHe walks by them and sings.\nAn old hare hoar,\nAnd an old hare hoar,\nIs very good meat in Lent;\nBut a hare that is hoar\nIs too much for a score\nWhen it hoars ere it be spent.\nRomeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner\nthither.\nRom. I will follow you.\nMer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,\n[sings] lady, lady, lady.\nExeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.\nNurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant\nwas\nthis that was so full of his ropery?\nRom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and\nwill\nspeak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\nNurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an\n'a\nwere lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I\ncannot,\nI'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his\nflirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must\nstand\nby too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!\nPeter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my\nweapon\nshould quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as\nsoon\nas another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the\nlaw\non my side.\nNurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me\nquivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told\nyou,\nmy young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I\nwill\nkeep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead\nher\ninto a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross\nkind of\nbehaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and\ntherefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were\nan\nill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak\ndealing.\nRom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\nthee-\nNurse. Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much. Lord,\nLord! she will be a joyful woman.\nRom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\nNurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I\ntake\nit, is a gentlemanlike offer.\nRom. Bid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon;\nAnd there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell\nBe shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.\nNurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.\nRom. Go to! I say you shall.\nNurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\nRom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.\nFarewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\nNurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\nRom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?\nNurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\nRom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.\nNurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!\nwhen 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in\ntown, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,\ngood\nsoul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I\nanger\nher sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;\nbut\nI'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\nclout\nin the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both\nwith\na letter?\nRom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\nNurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I\nknow\nit begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest\nsententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you\ngood\nto hear it.\nRom. Commend me to thy lady.\nNurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!\nPeter. Anon.\nNurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.\nExeunt.",

That's not so.\nO, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,\nWhich ten times faster glide than the sun's beams\nDriving back shadows over low'ring hills.\nTherefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\nOf this day's journey, and from nine till twelve\nIs three long hours; yet she is not come.\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\nShe would be as swift in motion as a ball;\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\nAnd his to me,\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead-\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\nEnter Nurse [and Peter].\nO God, she comes!

I am aweary, give me leave awhile.\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!\nJul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.\nNay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.\nNurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?\nDo you not see that I am out of breath?\nJul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that.\nSay either, and I'll stay the circumstance.\nLet me be satisfied, is't good or bad?\nNurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to\nchoose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better\nthan\nany man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a\nfoot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet\nthey\nare past compare.

What a head have I!\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\nMy back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\nTo catch my death with jauncing up and down!\nJul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\nSweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?\nNurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a\ncourteous,\nand a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where\nis\nyour mother?\nJul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest!\n'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\n\"Where is your mother?\"'\nNurse. O God's Lady dear!\nAre you so hot?

Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?\nJul. I have.\nNurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife.\nNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:\nThey'll be in scarlet straight at any news.\nHie you to church; I must another way,\nTo fetch a ladder, by the which your love\nMust climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.\nI am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\nBut you shall bear the burthen soon at night.\nGo; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\nJul.

I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\n(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.\nA piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,\nAll in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.\nJul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!\nTo prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!\nVile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,\nAnd thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!\nNurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!\nO courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman\nThat ever I should live to see thee dead!\nJul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?\nIs Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?\nMy dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?\nThen, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!\nFor who is living, if those two are gone?\nNurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;\nRomeo that kill'd him, he is banished.\nJul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?\nNurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!\nJul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!\nDid ever dragon keep so fair a cave?\nBeautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!\nDove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!\nDespised substance of divinest show!\nJust opposite to what thou justly seem'st-\nA damned saint, an honourable villain!\nO nature, what hadst thou to do in hell\nWhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend\nIn mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?\nWas ever book containing such vile matter\nSo fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell\nIn such a gorgeous palace!\nNurse. There's no trust,\nNo faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,\nAll forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.\nAh, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.\nThese griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.\nShame come to Romeo!\nJul. Blister'd be thy tongue\nFor such a wish! He was not born to shame.\nUpon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;\nFor 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd\nSole monarch of the universal earth.\nO, what a beast was I to chide at him!\nNurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?\nJul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\nAh, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name\nWhen I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?\nBut wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\nThat villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.\nBack, foolish tears, back to your native spring!\nYour tributary drops belong to woe,\nWhich you, mistaking, offer up to joy.\nMy husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;\nAnd Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.\nAll this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?\nSome word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,\nThat murd'red me. I would forget it fain;\nBut O, it presses to my memory\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!\n'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'\nThat 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there;\nOr, if sour woe delights in fellowship\nAnd needly will be rank'd with other griefs,\nWhy followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'\nThy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,\nWhich modern lamentation might have mov'd?\nBut with a rearward following Tybalt's death,\n'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\nAll slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-\nThere is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\nIn that word's death; no words can that woe sound.\nWhere is my father and my mother, nurse?\nNurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.\nWill you go to them? I will bring you thither.\nJul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,\nWhen theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.\nTake up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,\nBoth you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.\nHe made you for a highway to my bed;\nBut I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.\nCome, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;\nAnd death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!\nNurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo\nTo comfort you. I wot well where he is.\nHark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.\nI'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.\nJul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight\nAnd bid him come to take his last farewell.\nExeunt.",

      "text": "Scene III.\nFriar Laurence's cell.\nEnter Friar [Laurence].\nFriar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.\nAffliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,\nAnd thou art wedded to calamity.\nEnter Romeo.\nRom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand\nThat I yet know not?\nFriar. Too familiar\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\nI bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.\nRom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?\nFriar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-\nNot body's death, but body's banishment.\nRom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\nMuch more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'\nFriar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\nRom. There is no world without Verona walls,\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\nHence banished is banish'd from the world,\nAnd world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'\nIs death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'\nThou cut'st my head off with a golden axe\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\nFriar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!\nThy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,\nTaking thy part, hath brush'd aside the law,\nAnd turn'd that black word death to banishment.\nThis is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.\nRom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,\nWhere Juliet lives; and every cat and dog\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\nLive here in heaven and may look on her;\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\nIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty,\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;\nBut Romeo may not- he is banished.\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly;\nThey are free men, but I am banished.\nAnd sayest thou yet that exile is not death?\nHadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,\nBut 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?\nO friar, the damned use that word in hell;\nHowling attends it! How hast thou the heart,\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,\nTo mangle me with that word 'banished'?\nFriar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.\nRom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\nFriar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;\nAdversity's sweet milk, philosophy,\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\nRom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\nDisplant a town, reverse a prince's doom,\nIt helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.\nFriar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.\nRom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\nFriar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.\nRom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\nAn hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\nThen mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\nAnd fall upon the ground, as I do now,\nTaking the measure of an unmade grave.\nKnock [within].\nFriar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\nRom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,\nMist-like infold me from the search of eyes. Knock.\nFriar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;\nThou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up; Knock.\nRun to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,\nWhat simpleness is this.- I come, I come! Knock.\nWho knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will?\nNurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\nI come from Lady Juliet.\nFriar. Welcome then.\nEnter Nurse.\nNurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,\nWhere is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?\nFriar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.\nNurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,\nJust in her case!\nFriar. O woeful sympathy!\nPiteous predicament!\nNurse. Even so lies she,\nBlubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\nStand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.\nFor Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!\nWhy should you fall into so deep an O?\nRom. (rises) Nurse-\nNurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.\nRom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\nDoth not she think me an old murtherer,\nNow I have stain'd the childhood of our joy\nWith blood remov'd but little from her own?\nWhere is she? and how doth she! and what says\nMy conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?\nNurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\nAnd Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,\nAnd then down falls again.\nRom. As if that name,\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\nDid murther her; as that name's cursed hand\nMurder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,\nIn what vile part of this anatomy\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\nThe hateful mansion. [Draws his dagger.]\nFriar. Hold thy desperate hand.\nArt thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;\nThy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\nThe unreasonable fury of a beast.\nUnseemly woman in a seeming man!\nOr ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\nThou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,\nI thought thy disposition better temper'd.\nHast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\nAnd slay thy lady that in thy life lives,\nBy doing damned hate upon thyself?\nWhy railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?\nSince birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet\nIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\nFie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\nWhich, like a usurer, abound'st in all,\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax\nDigressing from the valour of a man;\nThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\nKilling that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;\nThy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\nLike powder in a skilless soldier's flask,\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\nAnd thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.\nWhat, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\nBut thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.\nThe law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend\nAnd turns it to exile. There art thou happy.\nA pack of blessings light upon thy back;\nHappiness courts thee in her best array;\nBut, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,\nThou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.\nTake heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\nGo get thee to thy love, as was decreed,\nAscend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\nBut look thou stay not till the watch be set,\nFor then thou canst not pass to Mantua,\nWhere thou shalt live till we can find a time\nTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\nBeg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\nWith twenty hundred thousand times more joy\nThan thou went'st forth in lamentation.\nGo before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\nAnd bid her hasten all the house to bed,\nWhich heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\nRomeo is coming.\nNurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night\nTo hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\nMy lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.\nRom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\nNurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.\nHie you, make haste, for it grows very late. Exit.\nRom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!\nFriar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:\nEither be gone before the watch be set,\nOr by the break of day disguis'd from hence.\nSojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,\nAnd he shall signify from time to time\nEvery good hap to you that chances here.\nGive me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.\nRom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,\nIt were a grief so brief to part with thee.\nFarewell.\nExeunt.",

Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.\nWould none but I might venge my cousin's death!\nLady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\nThen weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,\nWhere that same banish'd runagate doth live,\nShall give him such an unaccustom'd dram\nThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company;\nAnd then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\nJul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied\nWith Romeo till I behold him- dead-\nIs my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.\nMadam, if you could find out but a man\nTo bear a poison, I would temper it;\nThat Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\nSoon sleep in quiet.

Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.\nBut now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\nJul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.\nWhat are they, I beseech your ladyship?\nLady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\nOne who, to put thee from thy heaviness,\nHath sorted out a sudden day of joy\nThat thou expects not nor I look'd not for.\nJul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?\nLady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn\nThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\nThe County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,\nShall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\nJul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,\nHe shall not make me there a joyful bride!\nI wonder at this haste, that I must wed\nEre he that should be husband comes to woo.\nI pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\nI will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\nIt shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\nRather than Paris. These are news indeed!\nLady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,\nAnd see how he will take it at your hands.\nEnter Capulet and Nurse.\nCap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,\nBut for the sunset of my brother's son\nIt rains downright.\nHow now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\nEvermore show'ring? In one little body\nThou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:\nFor still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\nDo ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is\nSailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,\nWho, raging with thy tears and they with them,\nWithout a sudden calm will overset\nThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\nHave you delivered to her our decree?\nLady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\nI would the fool were married to her grave!\nCap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.\nHow? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\nIs she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\nUnworthy as she is, that we have wrought\nSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\nJul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.\nProud can I never be of what I hate,\nBut thankful even for hate that is meant love.\nCap. How now, how now, choplogic? What is this?\n'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-\nAnd yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,\nThank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\nBut fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next\nTo go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\nOut, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!\nYou tallow-face!\nLady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?\nJul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,\nHear me with patience but to speak a word.\nCap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!\nI tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday\nOr never after look me in the face.\nSpeak not, reply not, do not answer me!\nMy fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest\nThat God had lent us but this only child;\nBut now I see this one is one too much,\nAnd that we have a curse in having her.\nOut on her, hilding!\nNurse. God in heaven bless her!\nYou are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\nCap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,\nGood Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!\nNurse. I speak no treason.\nCap.

God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,\nAt home, abroad, alone, in company,\nWaking or sleeping, still my care hath been\nTo have her match'd; and having now provided\nA gentleman of princely parentage,\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,\nStuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,\nProportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-\nAnd then to have a wretched puling fool,\nA whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,\nTo answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;\nI am too young, I pray you pardon me'!\nBut, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me.\nLook to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:\nAn you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;\nAn you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\nFor, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,\nNor what is mine shall never do thee good.\nTrust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn. Exit.\nJul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds\nThat sees into the bottom of my grief?\nO sweet my mother, cast me not away!\nDelay this marriage for a month, a week;\nOr if you do not, make the bridal bed\nIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\nLady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.\nDo as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. Exit.\nJul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?\nMy husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.\nHow shall that faith return again to earth\nUnless that husband send it me from heaven\nBy leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.\nAlack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems\nUpon so soft a subject as myself!\nWhat say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?\nSome comfort, nurse.\nNurse. Faith, here it is.\nRomeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing\nThat he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;\nOr if he do, it needs must be by stealth.\nThen, since the case so stands as now it doth,\nI think it best you married with the County.\nO, he's a lovely gentleman!\nRomeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,\nHath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\nAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,\nI think you are happy in this second match,\nFor it excels your first; or if it did not,\nYour first is dead- or 'twere as good he were\nAs living here and you no use of him.\nJul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?\nNurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.\nJul. Amen!\nNurse. What?\nJul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.\nGo in; and tell my lady I am gone,\nHaving displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,\nTo make confession and to be absolv'd.\nNurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. Exit.",

My father Capulet will have it so,\nAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\nFriar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.\nUneven is the course; I like it not.\nPar. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,\nAnd therefore have I little talk'd of love;\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway,\nAnd in his wisdom hastes our marriage\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\nMay be put from her by society.\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\nFriar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\nEnter Juliet.\nPar. Happily met, my lady and my wife!\nJul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\nPar. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.\nJul. What must be shall be.\nFriar. That's a certain text.\nPar. Come you to make confession to this father?\nJul. To answer that, I should confess to you.\nPar. Do not deny to him that you love me.\nJul. I will confess to you that I love him.\nPar. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\nJul. If I do so, it will be of more price,\nBeing spoke behind your back, than to your face.\nPar. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.\nJul. The tears have got small victory by that,\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\nPar. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.\nJul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\nPar. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.\nJul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\nOr shall I come to you at evening mass?\nFriar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\nMy lord, we must entreat the time alone.\nPar. God shield I should disturb devotion!\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.\nTill then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. Exit.\nJul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\nCome weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!\nFriar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\nJul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\nIf in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\nDo thou but call my resolution wise\nAnd with this knife I'll help it presently.\nGod join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,\nShall be the label to another deed,\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\nTherefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,\nGive me some present counsel; or, behold,\n'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\nCould to no issue of true honour bring.\nBe not so long to speak. I long to die\nIf what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.\nFriar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\nA thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat cop'st with death himself to scape from it;\nAnd, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.\nJul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\nFrom off the battlements of yonder tower,\nOr walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,\nOr shut me nightly in a charnel house,\nO'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud-\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt,\nTo live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.\nFriar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.\nTo-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\nLet not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\nTake thou this vial, being then in bed,\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off;\nWhen presently through all thy veins shall run\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\nShall keep his native progress, but surcease;\nNo warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\nThe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\nTo paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall\nLike death when he shuts up the day of life;\nEach part, depriv'd of supple government,\nShall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;\nAnd in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death\nThou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\nNow, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\nThen, as the manner of our country is,\nIn thy best robes uncovered on the bier\nThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\nWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\nIn the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\nShall Romeo by my letters know our drift;\nAnd hither shall he come; and he and I\nWill watch thy waking, and that very night\nShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\nAnd this shall free thee from this present shame,\nIf no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\nAbate thy valour in the acting it.\nJul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\nFriar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous\nIn this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed\nTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\nJul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.\nFarewell, dear father.\nExeunt.",

[Dies.]\nRom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\nMercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!\nWhat said my man when my betossed soul\nDid not attend him as we rode? I think\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\nSaid he not so? or did I dream it so?\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune's book!\nI'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\nA grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.\n[Lays him in the tomb.]\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\nHave they been merry! which their keepers call\nA lightning before death. O, how may I\nCall this a lightning? O my love! my wife!\nDeath, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\nThou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\nAnd death's pale flag is not advanced there.\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\nThat unsubstantial Death is amorous,\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\nWill I set up my everlasting rest\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\nArms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death!\nCome, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\nThe dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!\nHere's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. Falls.\nEnter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.\nFriar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\nHave my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?\nBal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\nFriar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,\nWhat torch is yond that vainly lends his light\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\nIt burneth in the Capels' monument.\nBal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,\nOne that you love.\nFriar. Who is it?\nBal. Romeo.\nFriar. How long hath he been there?\nBal. Full half an hour.\nFriar. Go with me to the vault.\nBal. I dare not, sir.\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence,\nAnd fearfully did menace me with death\nIf I did stay to look on his intents.\nFriar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\nO, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.\nBal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,\nI dreamt my master and another fought,\nAnd that my master slew him.\nFriar. Romeo!\nAlack, alack, what blood is this which stains\nThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?\nWhat mean these masterless and gory swords\nTo lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]\nRomeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?",

Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\nChief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\nThese dead men's tombs.\nCap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\nThis dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\nAnd it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!\nWife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\nEnter Montague [and others].\nPrince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\nMon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!\nGrief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\nPrince. Look, and thou shalt see.\nMon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\nPrince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\nTill we can clear these ambiguities\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true descent;\nAnd then will I be general of your woes\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\nFriar. I am the greatest, able to do least,\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\nDoth make against me, of this direful murther;\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\nMyself condemned and myself excus'd.\nPrince. Then say at once what thou dost know in this.\nFriar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.\nI married them; and their stol'n marriage day\nWas Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death\nBanish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetroth'd and would have married her perforce\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me\nAnd with wild looks bid me devise some mean\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\nThen gave I her (so tutored by my art)\nA sleeping potion; which so took effect\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from her borrowed grave,\nBeing the time the potion's force should cease.\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\nWas stay'd by accident, and yesternight\nReturn'd my letter back. Then all alone\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred's vault;\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience;\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\nAll this I know, and to the marriage\nHer nurse is privy; and if aught in this\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrific'd, some hour before his time,\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\nPrince. We still have known thee for a holy man.\nWhere's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?\nBal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\nAnd threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not and left him there.\nPrince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.\nWhere is the County's page that rais'd the watch?\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\nBoy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\nAnd by-and-by my master drew on him;\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\nPrince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death;\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\nAnd I, for winking at you, discords too,\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.\nCap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter's jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\nMon. But I can give thee more;\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\nCap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity!\nPrince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\nSome shall be pardon'd, and some punished;\nFor never was a story of more woe",
