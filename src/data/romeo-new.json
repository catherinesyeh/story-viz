Many a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nShould in the farthest East bean to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\nAway from light steals home my heavy son\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\nBen. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?\nMon. I neither know it nor can learn of him.\nBen. Have you importun'd him by any means?\nMon. Both by myself and many other friends;\nBut he, his own affections' counsellor,\nIs to himself- I will not say how true-\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\nEnter Romeo.\nBen. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,\nI'll know his grievance, or be much denied.\nMon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay\nTo hear true shrift.

O loving hate!\nO anything, of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\nDost thou not laugh?\nBen. No, coz, I rather weep.\nRom. Good heart, at what?\nBen. At thy good heart's oppression.\nRom. Why, such is love's transgression.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\nWhich thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;\nBeing purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;\nBeing vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.\nWhat is it else?

Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\nRom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\nFor beauty, starv'd with her severity,\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\nShe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\nTo merit bliss by making me despair.\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\nDo I live dead that live to tell it now.\nBen. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.\nRom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\nBen. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.\nExamine other beauties.\nRom.

Thou canst not teach me to forget.\nBen. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt.",

That dreamers often lie.\nRom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\nMer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\nIn shape no bigger than an agate stone\nOn the forefinger of an alderman,\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\nAthwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\nHer wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,\nThe cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\nHer traces, of the smallest spider's web;\nHer collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;\nHer whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;\nHer wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\nNot half so big as a round little worm\nPrick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut,\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\nTime out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\nThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\nO'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;\nO'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\nO'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\nSometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\nTickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,\nThen dreams he of another benefice.\nSometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\nOf healths five fadom deep; and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\nAnd being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night\nAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,\nWhich once untangled much misfortune bodes\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\nThat presses them and learns them first to bear,\nMaking them women of good carriage.\nThis is she-\nRom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\nThou talk'st of nothing.\nMer. True, I talk of dreams;\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy;\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\nEven now the frozen bosom of the North\nAnd, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,\nTurning his face to the dew-dropping South.\nBen. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\nRom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives\nSome consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\nWith this night's revels and expire the term\nOf a despised life, clos'd in my breast,\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\nBut he that hath the steerage of my course\nDirect my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!\nBen. Strike, drum.\nThey march about the stage. [Exeunt.]",

      "text": "Scene II.\nCapulet's orchard.\nEnter Romeo.\nRom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.\nEnter Juliet above at a window.\nBut soft! What light through yonder window breaks?\nIt is the East, and Juliet is the sun!\nArise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\nWho is already sick and pale with grief\nThat thou her maid art far more fair than she.\nBe not her maid, since she is envious.\nHer vestal livery is but sick and green,\nAnd none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.\nIt is my lady; O, it is my love!\nO that she knew she were!\nShe speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\nHer eye discourses; I will answer it.\nI am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\nWhat if her eyes were there, they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\nO that I were a glove upon that hand,\nThat I might touch that cheek!\nJul. Ah me!\nRom. She speaks.\nO, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\nAs glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\nAs is a winged messenger of heaven\nUnto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes\nOf mortals that fall back to gaze on him\nWhen he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds\nAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.\nJul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name!\nOr, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I'll no longer be a Capulet.\nRom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\nJul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\nWhat's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\nBelonging to a man. O, be some other name!\nWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose\nBy any other name would smell as sweet.\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name;\nAnd for that name, which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself.\nRom. I take thee at thy word.\nCall me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\nJul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\nRom. By a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am.\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\nBecause it is an enemy to thee.\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\nJul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\nOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.\nArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\nRom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\nJul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\nRom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\nAnd what love can do, that dares love attempt.\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\nJul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.\nRom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye\nThan twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,\nAnd I am proof against their enmity.\nJul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.\nRom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here.\nMy life were better ended by their hate\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\nJul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?\nRom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\nI am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\nAs that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,\nI would adventure for such merchandise.\nJul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.\nFain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny\nWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment!\nDost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,\nThey say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\nOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\nI'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;\nBut trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,\nMy true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\nRom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-\nJul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\nRom. What shall I swear by?\nJul. Do not swear at all;\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I'll believe thee.\nRom. If my heart's dear love-\nJul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract to-night.\nIt is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!\nThis bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\nMay prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.\nGood night, good night! As sweet repose and rest\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast!\nRom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\nJul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\nRom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.\nJul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\nRom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\nJul. But to be frank and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have.\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\nI hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!\n[Nurse] calls within.\nAnon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\nStay but a little, I will come again. [Exit.]\nRom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,\nToo flattering-sweet to be substantial.\nEnter Juliet above.\nJul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\nThy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\nBy one that I'll procure to come to thee,\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\nNurse. (within) Madam!\nJul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,\nI do beseech thee-\nNurse. (within) Madam!\nJul. By-and-by I come.-\nTo cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.\nTo-morrow will I send.\nRom. So thrive my soul-\nJul. A thousand times good night! Exit.\nRom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!\nLove goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;\nBut love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\nEnter Juliet again, [above].\nJul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again!\nBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\nWith repetition of my Romeo's name.\nRomeo!\nRom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,\nLike softest music to attending ears!\nJul. Romeo!\nRom. My dear?\nJul. At what o'clock to-morrow\nShall I send to thee?\nRom. By the hour of nine.\nJul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\nRom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.\nJul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\nRememb'ring how I love thy company.\nRom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,\nForgetting any other home but this.\nJul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton's bird,\nThat lets it hop a little from her hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\nRom. I would I were thy bird.\nJul. Sweet, so would I.\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\nGood night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\n[Exit.]\nRom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!\nHence will I to my ghostly father's cell,\nHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\nExit",

A challenge, on my life.\nBen. Romeo will answer it.\nMer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.\nBen. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,\nbeing\ndared.\nMer.

Why, what is Tybalt?\nMer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the\ncourageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing\npricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his\nminim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very\nbutcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman\nof\nthe very first house, of the first and second cause.

Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a\nFrench\nsalutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit\nfairly last night.\nRom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\nMer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\nRom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such\na\ncase as mine a man may strain courtesy.\nMer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains\na\nman to bow in the hams.\nRom. Meaning, to cursy.\nMer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.\nRom. A most courteous exposition.\nMer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\nRom. Pink for flower.\nMer. Right.\nRom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.\nMer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out\nthy\npump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may\nremain, after the wearing, solely singular.\nRom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!\nMer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.\nRom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.\nMer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for\nthou\nhast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am\nsure, I\nhave in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\nRom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not\nthere\nfor the goose.\nMer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\nRom. Nay, good goose, bite not!\nMer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp\nsauce.\nRom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?\nMer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch\nnarrow to an ell broad!\nRom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to\nthe\ngoose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\nMer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now\nart\nthou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou\nart, by\nart as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a\ngreat natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his\nbauble in\na hole.\nBen. Stop there, stop there!\nMer.

Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the\nyoung\nRomeo?\nRom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you\nhave\nfound him than he was when you sought him.

An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an\n'a\nwere lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I\ncannot,\nI'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his\nflirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must\nstand\nby too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!\nPeter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my\nweapon\nshould quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as\nsoon\nas another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the\nlaw\non my side.\nNurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me\nquivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told\nyou,\nmy young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I\nwill\nkeep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead\nher\ninto a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross\nkind of\nbehaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and\ntherefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were\nan\nill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak\ndealing.\nRom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\nthee-\nNurse. Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much. Lord,\nLord! she will be a joyful woman.\nRom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\nNurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I\ntake\nit, is a gentlemanlike offer.\nRom. Bid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon;\nAnd there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell\nBe shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.\nNurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.\nRom. Go to! I say you shall.\nNurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\nRom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.\nFarewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\nNurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\nRom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?\nNurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\nRom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.\nNurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!\nwhen 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in\ntown, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,\ngood\nsoul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I\nanger\nher sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;\nbut\nI'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\nclout\nin the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both\nwith\na letter?\nRom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\nNurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I\nknow\nit begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest\nsententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you\ngood\nto hear it.\nRom. Commend me to thy lady.\nNurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!\nPeter. Anon.\nNurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.\nExeunt.",

That's not so.\nO, she is lame!

Answer to that.\nSay either, and I'll stay the circumstance.\nLet me be satisfied, is't good or bad?\nNurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to\nchoose a man. Romeo? No, not he.

And for that offence\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\nI have an interest in your hate's proceeding,\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;\nBut I'll amerce you with so strong a fine\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\nTherefore use none.

Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\nDoth not she think me an old murtherer,\nNow I have stain'd the childhood of our joy\nWith blood remov'd but little from her own?\nWhere is she? and how doth she! and what says\nMy conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?\nNurse.

Thy Juliet is alive,\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\nBut thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.\nThe law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend\nAnd turns it to exile.

You say you do not know the lady's mind.\nUneven is the course; I like it not.\nPar. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,\nAnd therefore have I little talk'd of love;\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway,\nAnd in his wisdom hastes our marriage\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\nMay be put from her by society.\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\nFriar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\nEnter Juliet.\nPar. Happily met, my lady and my wife!\nJul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\nPar. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.\nJul. What must be shall be.\nFriar. That's a certain text.\nPar. Come you to make confession to this father?\nJul. To answer that, I should confess to you.\nPar. Do not deny to him that you love me.\nJul. I will confess to you that I love him.\nPar. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\nJul. If I do so, it will be of more price,\nBeing spoke behind your back, than to your face.\nPar. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.\nJul. The tears have got small victory by that,\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\nPar. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.\nJul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\nPar. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.\nJul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\nOr shall I come to you at evening mass?\nFriar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\nMy lord, we must entreat the time alone.\nPar. God shield I should disturb devotion!\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.\nTill then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. Exit.\nJul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\nCome weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!\nFriar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\nJul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\nIf in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\nDo thou but call my resolution wise\nAnd with this knife I'll help it presently.\nGod join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,\nShall be the label to another deed,\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\nTherefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,\nGive me some present counsel; or, behold,\n'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\nCould to no issue of true honour bring.\nBe not so long to speak. I long to die\nIf what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.\nFriar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\nA thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat cop'st with death himself to scape from it;\nAnd, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.\nJul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\nFrom off the battlements of yonder tower,\nOr walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,\nOr shut me nightly in a charnel house,\nO'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud-\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt,\nTo live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.\nFriar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.\nTo-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\nLet not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\nTake thou this vial, being then in bed,\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off;\nWhen presently through all thy veins shall run\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\nShall keep his native progress, but surcease;\nNo warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\nThe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\nTo paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall\nLike death when he shuts up the day of life;\nEach part, depriv'd of supple government,\nShall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;\nAnd in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death\nThou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\nNow, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\nThen, as the manner of our country is,\nIn thy best robes uncovered on the bier\nThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\nWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\nIn the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\nShall Romeo by my letters know our drift;\nAnd hither shall he come; and he and I\nWill watch thy waking, and that very night\nShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\nAnd this shall free thee from this present shame,\nIf no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\nAbate thy valour in the acting it.\nJul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\nFriar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous\nIn this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed\nTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\nJul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.\nFarewell, dear father.\nExeunt.",

Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law\nIs death to any he that utters them.\nRom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness\nAnd fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\nNeed and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich;\nThen be not poor, but break it and take this.\nApoth. My poverty but not my will consents.\nRom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.\nApoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will\nAnd drink it off, and if you had the strength\nOf twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.\nRom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,\nDoing more murther in this loathsome world,\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\nI sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.\nFarewell.

Early in the morning\nSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.\nGive me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,\nWhate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof\nAnd do not interrupt me in my course.\nWhy I descend into this bed of death\nIs partly to behold my lady's face,\nBut chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\nA precious ring- a ring that I must use\nIn dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\nBut if thou, jealous, dost return to pry\nIn what I farther shall intend to do,\nBy heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild,\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\nBal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\nRom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\nLive, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.\nBal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.\nHis looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [Retires.]\nRom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\nGorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,\nThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\nAnd in despite I'll cram thee with more food.\nRomeo opens the tomb.\nPar. This is that banish'd haughty Montague\nThat murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief\nIt is supposed the fair creature died-\nAnd here is come to do some villanous shame\nTo the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\nStop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!\nCan vengeance be pursu'd further than death?\nCondemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\nObey, and go with me; for thou must die.\nRom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\nGood gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.\nFly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\nPut not another sin upon my head\nBy urging me to fury. O, be gone!\nBy heaven, I love thee better than myself,\nFor I come hither arm'd against myself.\nStay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say\nA madman's mercy bid thee run away.\nPar. I do defy thy conjuration\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.\nRom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\nThey fight.\nPage. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\n[Exit. Paris falls.]\nPar. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,\nOpen the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [Dies.]\nRom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\nMercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!\nWhat said my man when my betossed soul\nDid not attend him as we rode? I think\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\nSaid he not so? or did I dream it so?\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune's book!\nI'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\nA grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.\n[Lays him in the tomb.]\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\nHave they been merry! which their keepers call\nA lightning before death. O, how may I\nCall this a lightning? O my love! my wife!\nDeath, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\nThou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\nAnd death's pale flag is not advanced there.\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\nThat unsubstantial Death is amorous,\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\nWill I set up my everlasting rest\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\nArms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death!\nCome, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\nThe dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!\nHere's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. Falls.\nEnter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.\nFriar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\nHave my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?\nBal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\nFriar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,\nWhat torch is yond that vainly lends his light\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\nIt burneth in the Capels' monument.\nBal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,\nOne that you love.\nFriar. Who is it?\nBal. Romeo.\nFriar. How long hath he been there?\nBal. Full half an hour.\nFriar. Go with me to the vault.\nBal. I dare not, sir.\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence,\nAnd fearfully did menace me with death\nIf I did stay to look on his intents.\nFriar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\nO, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.\nBal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,\nI dreamt my master and another fought,\nAnd that my master slew him.\nFriar. Romeo!\nAlack, alack, what blood is this which stains\nThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?\nWhat mean these masterless and gory swords\nTo lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]\nRomeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\nAnd steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour\nIs guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.\nJuliet rises.\nJul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?\nI do remember well where I should be,\nAnd there I am. Where is my Romeo?\nFriar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\nOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\nA greater power than we can contradict\nHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\nThy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\nAnd Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee\nAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns.\nStay not to question, for the watch is coming.\nCome, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\nJul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.\nExit [Friar].\nWhat's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?\nPoison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\nO churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop\nTo help me after? I will kiss thy lips.\nHaply some poison yet doth hang on them\nTo make me die with a restorative. [Kisses him.]\nThy lips are warm!\nChief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?\nYea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!\n[Snatches Romeo's dagger.]\nThis is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.\nShe stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].",

Search about the\nchurchyard.\nGo, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.\n[Exeunt some of the Watch.]\nPitiful sight! here lies the County slain;\nAnd Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\nWho here hath lain this two days buried.\nGo, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;\nRaise up the Montagues; some others search.\n[Exeunt others of the Watch.]\nWe see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\nBut the true ground of all these piteous woes\nWe cannot without circumstance descry.\nEnter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].\n2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.\nChief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\nEnter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.\n3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\nWe took this mattock and this spade from him\nAs he was coming from this churchyard side.\nChief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.\nEnter the Prince [and Attendants].\nPrince. What misadventure is so early up,\nThat calls our person from our morning rest?\nEnter Capulet and his Wife [with others].\nCap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?\nWife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'\nSome 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,\nWith open outcry, toward our monument.\nPrince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?\nChief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;\nAnd Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,\nWarm and new kill'd.\nPrince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\nChief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\nThese dead men's tombs.\nCap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\nThis dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\nAnd it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!\nWife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\nEnter Montague [and others].\nPrince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\nMon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!\nGrief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\nPrince. Look, and thou shalt see.\nMon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\nPrince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\nTill we can clear these ambiguities\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true descent;\nAnd then will I be general of your woes\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\nFriar. I am the greatest, able to do least,\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\nDoth make against me, of this direful murther;\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\nMyself condemned and myself excus'd.\nPrince. Then say at once what thou dost know in this.\nFriar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.\nI married them; and their stol'n marriage day\nWas Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death\nBanish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetroth'd and would have married her perforce\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me\nAnd with wild looks bid me devise some mean\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\nThen gave I her (so tutored by my art)\nA sleeping potion; which so took effect\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from her borrowed grave,\nBeing the time the potion's force should cease.\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\nWas stay'd by accident, and yesternight\nReturn'd my letter back. Then all alone\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred's vault;\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience;\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\nAll this I know, and to the marriage\nHer nurse is privy; and if aught in this\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrific'd, some hour before his time,\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\nPrince. We still have known thee for a holy man.\nWhere's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?\nBal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\nAnd threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not and left him there.\nPrince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.\nWhere is the County's page that rais'd the watch?\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\nBoy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\nAnd by-and-by my master drew on him;\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\nPrince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death;\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\nAnd I, for winking at you, discords too,\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.\nCap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter's jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\nMon. But I can give thee more;\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\nCap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity!\nPrince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\nSome shall be pardon'd, and some punished;\nFor never was a story of more woe\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.",
