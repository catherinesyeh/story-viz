            "text": "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\nof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that\nNetherfield Park is let at last?\"\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\ntold me all about it.\"\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\n\"Do not you want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently.\n\"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\"\nThis was invitation enough.\n\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\nin the house by the end of next week.\"\n\"What is his name?\"\n\"Bingley.\"\n\"Is he married or single?\"\n\"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four\nor five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\n\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\nsoon as he comes.\"\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.\"\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\nI do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has\nfive grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own\nbeauty.\"\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.\"\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\nmerely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\nhim, if you do not.\"\n\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\ngood humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the\npreference.\"\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.\"\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\nthese twenty years at least.\"\n\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\nvisit them.\"\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.\"\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.",

            "text": "Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\npaid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\nsuddenly addressed her with,\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.\"\n\"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother\nresentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\n\"But you forget, mama,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\"\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\nof her.\"\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that you do\nnot depend on her serving you.\"\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she times\nthem ill.\"\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come back\ntill the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,\nfor she will not know him herself.\"\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\nMr. Bingley to _her_.\"\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\nmyself; how can you be so teazing?\"\n\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as\nshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\ntake it on myself.\"\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \"Nonsense,\nnonsense!\"\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried he. \"Do\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\nMary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great\nbooks, and make extracts.\"\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return to Mr.\nBingley.\"\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\n\"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\nwhile.\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said\na word about it till now.\"\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,\" said Mr. Bennet; and,\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.",

Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\nbook he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife's\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\nhad a very different story to hear.\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\nher twice. Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\ndown the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----\"\n\"If he had had any compassion for _me_,\" cried her husband impatiently,\n\"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of\nhis partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!\"\n\"Oh! my dear,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"I am quite delighted with him. He\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\nin my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown----\"\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\ndear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.\"",

But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good\nof every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of\nthe bad--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man's sisters too,\ndo you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\n\"Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\nneighbour in her.\"\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\nwith a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very\nlittle disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not\ndeficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of\nbeing agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were\nrather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private\nseminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the\nhabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\nof rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\nthemselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\nmemories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been\nacquired by trade.",

            "text": "Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\nbut did not live to do it.--Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\nsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\npurchase.\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\nage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an\nhour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\ngreat opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\neasiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could\noffer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never\nappeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the\nfirmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\nunderstanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,\nbut Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\nfastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In\nthat respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of\nbeing liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\ngirls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too\nmuch.\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\nestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.",

For\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\ncontrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,\nfriendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him\ncourteous.\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.--They had several children. The\neldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,\nwas Elizabeth's intimate friend.\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.",

If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\ndark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\ndiscover it too.\"\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.\"\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\nit, he must find it out.\"\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\nin love as much as she chuses.\"\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\nthese are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\nand has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\nenough to make her understand his character.\"\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\nevenings may do a great deal.\"\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\nchance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\never so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\nlife.\"",

To the civil enquiries which then\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\nattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\neat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish\nto a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\npronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;\nshe had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\nthought the same, and added,\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\nlooked almost wild.\"\n\"She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!\"\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\nin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\nhide it, not doing its office.\"\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but this was\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\nwell, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat\nquite escaped my notice.\"\n\"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\nan exhibition.\"\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\nit? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,\na most country town indifference to decorum.\"\n\"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\nBingley.\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n\"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\neyes.\"\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"--A\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.\n\"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet\ngirl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\nchance of it.\"\n\"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in\nMeryton.\"\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\nconsideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\ntheir dear friend's vulgar relations.",

            "text": "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\ndown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\nthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\nbelow with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\nreader and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am\n_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.\"\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\nothers; all that his library afforded.\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\nthan I ever look into.\"\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\nin the room.\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left\nso small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\ngenerations.\"\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\nbooks.\"\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\nthese.\"\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.\"\n\"I wish it may.\"\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.\"\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\nattention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\nsister, to observe the game.\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will\nshe be as tall as I am?\"\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or\nrather taller.\"\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely\naccomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is\nexquisite.\"\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\nto be so very accomplished, as they all are.\"\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net\npurses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I\nnever heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\ninformed that she was very accomplished.\"\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\notherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\ncannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my\nacquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your\nidea of an accomplished woman.\"\n\"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\nesteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\nwill be but half deserved.\"\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must yet\nadd something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\nextensive reading.\"\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\"\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all\nthis?\"\n\"_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.\"\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\nroom.\n\"Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \"is\none of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\nsex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\nsucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\n\"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\ndespicable.\"\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\ncontinue the subject.\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\nthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\neminent physicians. This, she would not hear of; but she was not so\nunwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\nwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\ndeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\nhowever, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to\nhis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every",

She longed to\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\neach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own\neasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\nequal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\nabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\nshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\nsudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\nyour sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.\"\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to\nwait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\nwould be at Meryton again.

            "text": "The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\nattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\nHe made no answer.\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\n\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the\nyear! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!\"\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.\"\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\npens remarkably well.\"\n\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\"\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\nHe was silent.\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\nGrantley's.\"\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At\npresent I have not room to do them justice.\"\n\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\nto determine.\"\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with\nease, cannot write ill.\"\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried her\nbrother--\"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for\nwords of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?\"\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way\nimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\nindirect boast.\"\n\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\"\n\"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\nthought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think\nat least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with\nquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\nBennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?\"\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\nprecipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.\"\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\nwould be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\ndependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay\ntill next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month.\"\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much\nmore than he did himself.\"\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\nintend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a\ncircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\ncould.\"\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\n\"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for\nhimself.\"\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but\nwhich I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand\naccording to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that\nthe friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the\ndelay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one\nargument in favour of its propriety.\"\n\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\nwith you.\"\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\neither.\"\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\ncircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\nbetween the parties?\"\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\nknow a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening\nwhen he has nothing to do.\"\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\nrather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\nbrother for talking such nonsense.\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.--\"You dislike an\nargument, and want to silence this.\"\n\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.\"\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.",

Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\nthe piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead\nthe way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\nseated herself.\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed\nElizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed\non her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\nadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because\nhe disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine however\nat last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about\nher more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than\nin any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\nhim too little to care for his approbation.\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\nlively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\nElizabeth, said to her--\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\nopportunity of dancing a reel?\"\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\nsurprise at her silence.\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before; but I could not immediately\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\ntheir premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell\nyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\nyou dare.\"\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\nmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had\nnever been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\nbelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\nshould be in some danger.\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some\nassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\ntheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\nnext day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\nand if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\nthe officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\nwhich your lady possesses.\"\n\"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\n\"Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle\nthe judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different\nlines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it\ntaken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\"\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\ncolour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be\ncopied.\"\nAt that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and\nElizabeth herself.\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley, in some\nconfusion, lest they had been overheard.\n\"You used us abominably ill,\" answered Mrs. Hurst, \"in running away\nwithout telling us that you were coming out.\"\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\nby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness\nand immediately said,--\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\navenue.\"\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\nlaughingly answered,\n\"No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to\nuncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\nfourth. Good bye.\"\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\nbeing at home again in a day or two.

She\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\nquestion, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\nis to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a\nbook!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\nan excellent library.\"\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\ncast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\ntowards him and said,\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\nNetherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\nsome among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\npleasure.\"\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he chuses,\nbefore it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and\nas soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my\ncards.\"\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\ntedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\nday.\"\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\nnear so much like a ball.\"\nMiss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about\nthe room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at\nwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation\nof her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to\nElizabeth, said,\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\nturn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting\nso long in one attitude.\"\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,\nthat he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and\ndown the room together, with either of which motives his joining them\nwould interfere. \"What could he mean? she was dying to know what could\nbe his meaning\"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand\nhim?\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe\non us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing\nabout it.\"\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any\nthing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two\nmotives.\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon\nas she allowed him to speak. \"You either chuse this method of passing\nthe evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be\ncompletely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better\nas I sit by the fire.\"",

But pride--where there is a real\nsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\"\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss\nBingley;--\"and pray what is the result?\"\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\nhimself without disguise.\"\n\"No\"--said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\nfor.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\nothers so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\nfeelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\nwould perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost\nfor ever.\"\n\"_That_ is a failing indeed!\"--cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well.--I\nreally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\"\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\nevil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\n\"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body.\"\n\"And yours,\" he replied with a smile, \"is wilfully to misunderstand\nthem.\"\n\"Do let us have a little music,\"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\nconversation in which she had no share.--\"Louisa, you will not mind my\nwaking Mr. Hurst.\"",

Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\nleast not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\nwell.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\ncontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\nJane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\nthen sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike\nof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\nshe felt herself to be right.\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at\nNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss\nBingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.\nHe wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\nshould _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been\nsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\nin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at\none time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\nall, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\nsee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most",

It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,\nmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\"\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\nPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\nin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\nchildren; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\nto do something or other about it.\"\nJane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.\nThey had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.\nBennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of\nhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\nfriends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father\ndid before him?\"\n\"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\nhead, as you will hear.\"\n_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\n15th October._\nDEAR SIR,\nThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured\nfather, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the\nmisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the\nbreach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing\nlest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good\nterms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at\nvariance.--\"There, Mrs. Bennet.\"--My mind however is now made up on\nthe subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been\nso fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right\nHonourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,\nwhose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable\nrectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to\ndemean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be\never ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are\ninstituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I\nfeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\nall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds\nI flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\nentail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,\nand not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be\notherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your\namiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to\nassure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but\nof this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me\ninto your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on\nyou and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and\nshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday\nse'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as\nLady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a\nSunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the\nduty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to\nyour lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,\nWILLIAM COLLINS.\"",

I have great hopes of finding him quite the\nreverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\nletter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\"\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"his letter does not seem\ndefective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\nthink it is well expressed.\"\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any\ndegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which\nastonished her husband and daughters.\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\npoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need\nof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,\nheavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\ninstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did\nnot doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.\nThis gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but\nMrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,\n\"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\nprove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\noddly.\"\n\"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.\"\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things\nI know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.\"\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\nforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\nprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps\nwhen we are better acquainted----\"\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\nother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;\nand his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet's\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\nown future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\nhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\nhim with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\npardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a\nquarter of an hour.",

Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\nto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\napprove of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\npeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\nneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\ntwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and I\ndare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\"\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane\nfrom Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.\"\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?\"\n\"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\nextensive property.\"\n\"Ah!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?\"\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\nthat in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the\nhandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\nthe young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\nconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\naccomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\ncourt.\"\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\nthe British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased\nwith the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\nladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\nher.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\npay.\"\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?\"\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\nMr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\nas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,",

You could not have met with a person more capable of\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\nconnected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.\"\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\nyesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth warmly,--\"I have spent\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\ndisagreeable.\"\n\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\nastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\nanywhere else.--Here you are in your own family.\"\n\"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\nHertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\nhim more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.\"\n\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\nill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\nlikely to be in this country much longer.\"\n\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\n\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of\nvery great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every\nthing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory\nof his father.\"",

            "text": "Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but\nvery intelligible gallantry.\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\n\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be a\nmost respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\nfarther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\nwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\nwere speaking of just now.\"\n\"Indeed!\"\n\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\nelsewhere.\"\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be?--How could\nhis will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?\"\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.\nCertain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\nany thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\nfreely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.\"\n\"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\n\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\never as he expressed them.\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?--what\ncan have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\nattachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not\na temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of\npreference which was often given me.\"\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\nthis!\"\nAfter a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_ remember\nhis boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his\nresentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must\nbe dreadful.\"\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham, \"_I_ can\nhardly be just to him.\"\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\ntreat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his\nfather!\"--She could have added, \"A young man too, like _you_, whose very\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented\nherself with \"And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\nmanner!\"\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest\npart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\nappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,\nand when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself.\"\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable!--I wonder that the very\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\ndishonesty I must call it.\"\n\"It _is_ wonderful,\"--replied Wickham,--\"for almost all his actions may\nbe traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend. It has\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger\nimpulses even than pride.\"\n\"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?\"\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve\nthe poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what\nhis father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\nwhich with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful\nguardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the\nmost attentive and best of brothers.\"\n\"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?\"\nHe shook his head.--\"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain\nto speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,--very,\nvery proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and\nextremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her\namusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about\nfifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished. Since her\nfather's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,",

His pride\nnever deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,\nsincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing\nsomething for fortune and figure.\"\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\nthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\nElizabeth and Mrs. Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\nher with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\nmake herself uneasy.\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\ncard table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\nare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\nlittle matters.\"\nMr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him a\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\n\"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's\nconnections.

Interested people have perhaps\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\nwithout actual blame on either side.\"\n\"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\nbusiness?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\nsomebody.\"\n\"Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a\nmanner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\nexcessively deceived in him? oh! no.\"\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than\nthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me\nlast night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it\nbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his\nlooks.\"\n\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to\nthink.\"\n\"I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.\"\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.\nBingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the\naffair became public.\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\nthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their",

Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy's\nlooks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,\ndepended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though\nthey each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.\nWickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\na ball was at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family\nthat she had no disinclination for it.\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is enough.--I\nthink it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every\nbody.\"\nElizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he\ndid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\neither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\ndance.\n\"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a ball of\nthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\nhave any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself\nthat I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins\nin the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting\nyours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr. Collins\ninstead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\nfor it however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth however did not chuse to\ntake the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,\nfor from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\naunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\ntrial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the\nimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than\na dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and",

She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\nturned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly\nsurmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality\nprovoked her.\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\nspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\nnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to\nthe oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\nnotice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;\nthey were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\naware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\npartner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\nhim was ecstacy.\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\nwere over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\nknowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\nmind; Charlotte tried to console her.\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\n\"Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To\nfind a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me\nsuch an evil.\"\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a\nsimpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\nin the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\nreading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\nfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would",

He replied, and was again silent.\nAfter a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with\n\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.--_I_ talked about\nthe dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of\nthe room, or the number of couples.\"\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\nsaid.\n\"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public\nones.--But _now_ we may be silent.\"\n\"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?\"\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\nentirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.\"\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\nposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\nsaid he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_\nthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\nthe temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.\"\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his\nfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\nconstrained manner said,\n\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\n_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\nis less certain.\"\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\nwith emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\nhis life.\"\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\nDarcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his\ndancing and his partner.\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing\nat her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,\nSir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching\nconverse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\nWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\nhe turned to his partner, and said,\n\"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.\"\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\nthemselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\n\"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\nfeelings.\"\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions.\"\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\nsomething else.\"\n\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\nwith a look of doubt.\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\nby her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\nthat you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\ncreated_.\"\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\n\"I hope not.\"\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\nto be secure of judging properly at first.\"\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\n\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\nto shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\n\"And what is your success?\"\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that report may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.\"\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in",

My total\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?\"\n\"Indeed I am.

It will be in my power to\nassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night.\"\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her\nwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she\nceased speaking, replied thus,\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\nwhich regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\nsame time maintained.

Her cousin prefaced his speech with\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\"\n\"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"--It vexed her to see him\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained\nwonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied\nwith an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\nthat very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\ncould bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of\nendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\nshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\nventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\nopenly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be\nsoon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.\nBennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of\nthe match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living\nbut three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\nshe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\nchance of it.\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\n\"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you\nto offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\nso doing.\"\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother\nwould talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed\nand blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\nsteady gravity.\nAt length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\nElizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\nElizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she\nwatched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\namongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\nbegan another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\nher voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.\nShe looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\ntalking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\nsigns of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however\nimpenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\nand when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\n\"That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\nLet the other young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and",

            "text": "Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\nher anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to\nassert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\nrector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make\nsuch an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not\noffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every\nbody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot\nacquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should\nomit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected\nwith the family.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,\nwhich had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many\nstared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet\nhimself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having\nspoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that\nhe was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\nTo Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\nsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\nHe assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\nthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\nher, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\nthe whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\nher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\ngood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\nShe was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice;\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\nit.\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\nmanoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of\nan hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\nlong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord,\nhow tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\naddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\npleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\nwaiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\ngo the next day for a short time.\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\nsettlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.",

            "text": "The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,\n\"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\ncourse of this morning?\"\nBefore Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\nBennet instantly answered,\n\"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am\nsure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\" And\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\ncalled out,\n\"Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr. Collins must excuse\nme.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear. I am\ngoing away myself.\"\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are.\"--And\nupon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\nto escape, she added, \"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\nMr. Collins.\"\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\nto conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided\nbetween distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\nsoon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\nmother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\nfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\nmarrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of\nselecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\nhe continued:\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\nof matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add\nvery greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have\nmentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation\nof the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.\nTwice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\nsubject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\nHunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\narranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any\nthing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\nassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\nfather, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy\nmyself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\nin the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother's\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n\"You are too hasty, Sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no\nanswer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\nthem.\"\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\nhand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\nthird time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\nsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\n\"Upon my word, Sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is rather an\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\nwould make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\nsituation.\"\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins\nvery gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.\"\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\nbelieving what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she thus\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\naddressed her,\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\nfirst application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\nfemale character.\"\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\nmay convince you of its being one.\"\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\nrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\nbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\nis unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\nbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\nwith the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther\nconsideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\nportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the\neffects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\ntherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\nshall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\n\"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\nfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\ntruth from her heart.\"\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\nbeing acceptable.\"\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\nreply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he\npersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\nin such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.",

Mr. Collins\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe\nit, and could not help saying so.\n\"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\nbrought to reason.

I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\nhusband, called out as she entered the library,\n\"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\nnot have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\nnot have _her_.\"\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\non her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\nher communication.\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had\nfinished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business.\"\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\nmarrying him.\"\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\nlibrary.\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?\" Elizabeth replied that it was.\n\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\n\"I have, Sir.\"\n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\naccepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\nbe a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\nif you _do_.\"\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.",

The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are\non their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.\nYou shall hear what she says.\"\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words. \"I do not pretend to\nregret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my\ndearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many\nreturns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean\nwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these high\nflown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\nsaw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\ncease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful",

I will read it to you--\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\ntook him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\nCharles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\nalready there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of\nwhom we shall deprive you.\"\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\nwinter.\"\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.\"\n\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.\nBut you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\" \"Mr. Darcy\nis impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are\nscarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana\nDarcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the\naffection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of\nher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to\nfavour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\nof so many?\"\n\"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"--said Jane as she\nfinished it. \"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare\nthat Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she\nis perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\nput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?\"\n\"Most willingly.\"\n\"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\ndoes not care about you.\"\nJane shook her head.\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you\ntogether, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is\nnot such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy\nfor herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is\nthis. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the\nmore anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\nwhen there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in\nachieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\ndare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of\nbeing in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\nrepresentation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any\none; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\nherself.\"\n\"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\nwill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means.\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\nelsewhere?\"\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth, \"and if upon mature\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\nall means to refuse him.\"\n\"How can you talk so?\"--said Jane faintly smiling,--\"You must know that\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\nnot hesitate.\"\n\"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider\nyour situation with much compassion.\"\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\nso totally independent of every one.\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\nJane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\nBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\nto go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\nlamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking\nthat Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,\nand the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though\nhe had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have\ntwo full courses.",

Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor\nagreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be\nimaginary. But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly\neither of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it\nwas the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small\nfortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their\npleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been\nhandsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable\ncircumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to\nElizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other\nperson. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though\nher resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such\ndisapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and\ntherefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise\nof secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept\nwithout difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst\nforth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some\ningenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great\nself-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.",

Mrs. Bennet wished\nto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\nher younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a\nsolidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and\nimprove himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\nthat Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from\npossibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the\nbounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!\"\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\nstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon\nregained her composure, and calmly replied,\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\nfor it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect\nof their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished\nher all imaginable happiness.\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte,--\"you must be\nsurprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to\nmarry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you\nwill be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I\nnever was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\nchance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on\nentering the marriage state.\"\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\"--and after an awkward pause,\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\nlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\nwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\nof marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being\nnow accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony\nwas not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it\npossible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every\nbetter feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,\nwas a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing\nherself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot",

Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy.\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\ntogether; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\nconsole and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\nor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\ncould at all forgive their daughter.",

The chief of every day was spent by\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of any\nthing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and\nwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\nMiss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\nthem she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\nand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\nmake way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!\"\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.\"\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of\nmaking any answer, she went on as before,\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\nnot for the entail I should not mind it.\"\n\"What should not you mind?\"\n\"I should not mind any thing at all.\"\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\ninsensibility.\"\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.\nHow any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from\none's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.\nCollins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\"",
