The threads seemed alive, writhing in her\nfingers as though guiding her. She paused, staring at the fabric taking shape\nbefore her, the colors blending in ways she had not intended. Her heart raced\nas her fingers followed the threads' pull, creating patterns that whispered of\nsomething more\u2014something far beyond her understanding.\nHer curiosity grew as the hours slipped by unnoticed. The tapestry was larger\nthan any she had woven before, intricate patterns intertwining, hinting at\nstories she could not fully grasp. She felt a pull deep in her chest, an\ninstinct to keep weaving, to let the threads lead her where they wished. Yet a\nsmall part of her was frightened\u2014she had never heard of such a thing happening\nto a weaver. Magic was a rarity, something spoken of only in the old tales.\nCould this be the first signs of it within her?",

She had\nstayed up late, staring at the tapestry, wondering what it could mean. Was it a\nvision of the future? A warning? She wasn't sure.\n\"Elara!\" A voice cut through her thoughts, and she turned to see Tomis, her\nchildhood friend, approaching with a wide grin. He was tall and\nbroad-shouldered, his hands calloused from years of working the fields. \"You\nlook lost in thought. Something on your mind?\"\nElara forced a smile, shaking her head. \"Just thinking about my work.\"\nTomis chuckled. \"You and your tapestries. I swear, one day you'll weave\nsomething so grand that even the king will want it.\"\nElara's smile faltered. If only he knew. \"Maybe,\" she replied, trying to sound\nlighthearted. \"But for now, I'll settle for selling enough to keep me fed.\"\nTomis eyed her for a moment, his smile fading. \"You know, Elara, you've been\ndifferent lately. Since your grandmother started teaching you those old\ntechniques\u2026\" He trailed off, scratching the back of his neck. \"I'm not saying I\nbelieve in all that magic nonsense, but people are starting to talk.\"\n\"Talk?\" Elara's stomach tightened. \"What kind of talk?\"\n\"Just rumors. That maybe you're meddling with things you shouldn't.\" He looked\naround, lowering his voice. \"I'm not saying I believe it, but\u2026 be careful,\nalright?\"\nElara nodded, her throat tight. She wanted to dismiss his words, to laugh it\noff like she always did. But after what had happened in her cottage, she wasn't\nso sure anymore.",

The\ntavern keeper, Edric, paused mid-conversation with a regular and gave the man a\nwary look. \"What can I get you?\" Edric asked, his jovial tone dampened by the\nstranger's presence.\nThe man didn't respond right away, instead pulling back his hood slightly to\nreveal sharp, angular features and eyes that seemed to pierce through the dim\nlight of the tavern. \"Ale,\" he finally said, his voice low and smooth, but\nthere was something else in it\u2014something Elara couldn't quite place. Edric,\nseemingly unfazed by the oddity, nodded and poured the drink.\nElara kept her gaze down, but she couldn't help the prickle of curiosity\ncreeping up her spine. She wasn't the only one who noticed him. Conversations\nresumed, but she saw how the regulars stole glances at the stranger, their\nwhispers hushed and cautious. It wasn't often that outsiders passed through\ntheir quiet village, especially ones with such an air of mystery.\nThe stranger didn't linger at the bar. With his drink in hand, he scanned the\nroom before settling in the darkest corner of the tavern, away from the fire\nand the warmth of the crowd. Elara tried to ignore him, focusing instead on the\ncrackling fire before her, but her mind kept drifting back to him. Who was he?\nAnd why did he seem to bring a shadow into the room with him?\nAfter a while, she finished her drink and stood to leave, but as she passed the\ntable where the stranger sat, she felt his gaze on her. Her steps faltered for\na moment, and she hesitated, glancing over her shoulder. His eyes were on\nher\u2014sharp, unblinking, and filled with an intensity that made her heart skip a\nbeat.

His face was still\npartially obscured, but up close, she could see the sharpness of his features,\nthe shadow of stubble along his jaw, and the cold, calculating look in his eyes.\n\"Elara, the weaver,\" he said, his voice low but carrying a strange, undeniable\nauthority.\nElara's heart raced. \"That's me,\" she said cautiously, gripping the doorframe\nto steady herself. \"Who are you?\"\n\"That's not important,\" he replied, stepping past her into the cottage as\nthough he owned the place. Elara's skin prickled at his intrusion, but before\nshe could protest, he turned to face her, his eyes glinting in the morning\nlight. \"What's important is what I need you to do.\"\nShe swallowed hard, glancing toward the loom in the corner of the room. \"And\nwhat might that be?\"\n\"I need you to weave something for me,\" the man said, his voice as smooth as\nsilk but laced with something darker. He reached into his cloak and pulled out\na small pouch, tossing it onto her worktable. The sound of clinking coins\nechoed through the cottage, the weight of the gold unmistakable.\n\"I don't just weave for anyone,\" Elara replied, crossing her arms over her\nchest, trying to maintain some semblance of control. \"What are you asking me to\nmake?\"\nThe man's gaze drifted toward the loom, then back to her. \"I need you to weave\nthe future.\"\nElara blinked, sure she had misheard him. \"The future?\" she repeated,\nincredulous. \"You can't be serious.\"\n\"I am,\" he said, his tone never wavering. \"I've heard of your... talents. I\nknow you can see things in the threads\u2014things no ordinary weaver can. I need\nyou to weave a tapestry that shows what is to come.\"\nElara's breath caught in her throat. How could he know about her visions? She\nhad told no one, not even her grandmother, about the strange things she had\nwoven recently. Her thoughts raced as she considered her options. Refusing him\ndidn't seem wise, but agreeing to such a task felt dangerous, like meddling\nwith forces she barely understood.\n\"What exactly do you want to see?\" she asked cautiously.\n\"The fate of a village,\" he replied. \"One not far from here. Glenth, I believe\nit's called.\"\nElara's blood ran cold at the name. Glenth was a neighboring village, just over\nthe hills, a place she had visited only once. \"Why Glenth?\"\n\"That's none of your concern,\" the man said, his voice hardening. \"Do we have a\ndeal or not?\"\nElara hesitated, her eyes flicking between the man and the gold on her table.\nShe knew this was a terrible idea\u2014knew that whatever power had awakened in her\nwas not meant to be used this way. But the lure of the unknown, the possibility\nof discovering more about her abilities, was too strong to resist.\n\"We have a deal,\" she whispered.",

She had not woven since the fire in Glenth.\nThe memory of it still haunted her, filling her with a gnawing guilt she\ncouldn't shake. Her hands had been the ones to create that tapestry, to bring\nabout that destruction, even if she hadn't fully understood what she was doing.\nNow, the loom seemed like a thing of menace, its threads fraught with danger.\nThe door creaked open, and Elara looked up to see her grandmother stepping\ninside, carrying a basket of herbs from the garden. Grandmother Nira set the\nbasket down and gave Elara a long, searching look. \"You've been brooding too\nmuch, child,\" she said, her voice soft but firm. \"Sitting by the fire won't\nchange anything.\"\nElara sighed, dropping her gaze to her hands. \"What else can I do? I brought\nruin to Glenth. I... I didn't mean to, but it happened because of me.\"\nNira's eyes softened, though her expression remained grave. \"Fate is a delicate\nthing, Elara. It's not something that can be controlled easily, even by those\nwho have the gift.\"\nElara's head snapped up, her heart thudding in her chest. \"Gift?\" she repeated,\nincredulous. \"This doesn't feel like a gift. It feels like a curse.\"\nNira crossed the room and sat beside her, her hands clasped tightly in her lap.\n\"That's because you don't yet understand it. You're still learning, and you're\nfrightened, as you should be. But our family has always had this gift\u2014the\nability to weave fate into the fabric of the world.\"\nElara blinked, her mind reeling from her grandmother's words. \"Our family?\"\nNira nodded slowly, her expression solemn. \"For generations, the women in our\nfamily have been fate-weavers. It's why I've kept you so close, why I've taught\nyou the old ways. You're not the first to have seen things in the threads. But\nyou are the first in a long time to be able to truly shape them.\"\nElara's throat tightened. \"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\"\nNira's eyes flickered with something that looked like regret. \"I had hoped...\nyou wouldn't need to know. I had hoped the gift would remain dormant in you.\nBut now that it's awakened, you need to be careful, Elara. The power to weave\nfate is dangerous, not just to others but to yourself as well.\"\nThe weight of her grandmother's words settled heavily on Elara's shoulders. She\nhad always known there was something special about her family's weaving,\nsomething that set them apart from the other seamstresses in the village. But\nto learn that they had been manipulating fate, shaping the destinies of\nothers\u2014it was almost too much to comprehend.",

The\nshrine had always been a place of solace for Elara, a quiet refuge where she\ncould clear her mind. She sank down onto the moss-covered stone bench, her\nthoughts still racing.\nThe idea of weaving fate, of controlling the threads of people's lives,\nfrightened her. She had never wanted such power. All she had ever wanted was to\ncreate beautiful tapestries, to bring joy to the villagers with her craft. But\nnow, her hands were stained with the weight of fate, and she didn't know how to\nfree herself from it.\nHer mind drifted back to Glenth\u2014the fire, the destruction, the cries of the\nvillagers as they fled their homes. It had all happened exactly as she had seen\nit in her tapestry. How could she have known? How could she have stopped it? A\npart of her wished she had never touched that loom, never discovered the\nstrange power lurking within the threads.\nBut another part of her\u2014a quiet, insistent part\u2014wondered if there was a way to\nuse this power for good. Could she shape the threads in a way that helped\npeople, that brought about positive change instead of ruin?\nThe sound of rustling leaves drew her attention, and Elara looked up to see a\ndeer emerging from the trees. It stood at the edge of the clearing, its dark\neyes fixed on her. For a moment, they simply watched each other in silence.\nThen, without warning, the deer darted back into the forest, vanishing among\nthe shadows.\nElara exhaled slowly, her heart still pounding in her chest. She didn't have\nall the answers\u2014not yet\u2014but she knew one thing for certain: she couldn't ignore\nthis gift. It was part of her now, whether she liked it or not.

Her thoughts were\nclearer now, though the weight of her newfound responsibility still pressed\nheavily on her. She had spent the day reflecting at the shrine, trying to come\nto terms with everything her grandmother had revealed. But there was still so\nmuch she didn't know, so much she didn't understand.\nWhen she pushed open the door, she was greeted by the sight of her younger\nsister, Lysa, sitting at the table, her small hands working diligently at a\nsimple piece of embroidery. Lysa looked up and smiled brightly when she saw\nElara, her innocent face full of warmth and curiosity. \"Elara! I was wondering\nwhen you'd come back.\"\nElara forced a smile and sat down across from her sister. \"What are you working\non?\" she asked, though her mind was still elsewhere.\n\"Just a flower,\" Lysa said, holding up the fabric to show her. \"I wanted to\nmake something pretty to give to Grandmother.\"\nElara nodded, her heart aching at the simplicity of it all. Lysa had no idea of\nthe burden their family carried, no idea of the power that ran through their\nbloodline. Elara wanted to protect her from it, to shield her from the weight\nof fate, but she knew it was only a matter of time before Lysa started asking\nquestions.\n\"Can you show me how to do that fancy stitch you use on your tapestries?\" Lysa\nasked, her wide eyes filled with admiration.\nElara hesitated, her fingers twitching as memories of the loom flooded back.\nShe didn't want Lysa to become entangled in the same web of fate that she was.\nBut she also couldn't bear to refuse her sister's request. \"Maybe another\ntime,\" she said softly. \"It's... a little more complicated than what you're\nused to.\"\nLysa's face fell, but she nodded in understanding. \"Okay,\" she said quietly,\nreturning to her embroidery. \"But someday, I want to make something as\nbeautiful as your tapestries.\"\nElara swallowed the lump in her throat, guilt washing over her. Her\ntapestries\u2014once a source of pride\u2014now felt like a dangerous tool, capable of\nshaping destinies in ways she could barely comprehend. \"Maybe someday,\" she\nwhispered, though she wasn't sure if that was a promise she could keep.",

Didn't want to curse us with your magic? You should have\nleft well enough alone, Elara. But now... now it's too late.\"\nElara took a step back, her heart pounding in her chest. She could feel the\nanger radiating from Rurik, the distrust that had taken root in his heart. And\nshe knew, deep down, that he wasn't the only one who felt this way.\nBefore she could respond, Rurik turned and stormed off, his heavy footsteps\nechoing in the quiet field. Elara stood there, her hands trembling at her\nsides, her mind racing. She had no answers, no solutions. All she had was the\nterrible knowledge that something had gone horribly wrong\u2014and she was powerless\nto stop it.",

But they were just stories, passed down through generations.\nShe had never imagined they were real, let alone that they would come looking\nfor her.\n\"What do you want with me?\" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.\nMaelis stepped closer, his gaze never wavering. \"You've been weaving fate,\nhaven't you?\" he said softly, though there was no judgment in his tone, only\ncuriosity. \"The things you've done\u2014both intentional and unintentional\u2014have not\ngone unnoticed.

The idea that she had been observed, that her actions\nhad been tracked, sent a wave of fear through her. \"I never meant to\u2014\"\n\"It doesn't matter what you meant,\" Maelis interrupted, his voice calm but\nfirm. \"What matters is what you can do. And the guild is very interested in\nyour talents.\"\nShe took a step back, her mind racing. \"I don't want anything to do with your\nguild.\"\nHis smile widened, but there was no warmth in it. \"It's not a matter of what\nyou want, Elara. It's a matter of what is meant to be.\"\nBefore she could respond, Maelis turned and began walking toward the edge of\nthe village. \"Think carefully,\" he called over his shoulder. \"The guild offers\npower, control over your gift.

She had\ncome to the shrine again, hoping that the quiet would help her think, would\ngive her some clarity about what she should do. The trees loomed around her,\ntheir branches forming a canopy that blocked out much of the sky, casting the\nforest in a muted, green light.\nAs she neared the shrine, she felt the familiar sense of peace wash over her,\nthe weight of her worries lifting slightly. But this time, the peace didn't\nlast long. Maelis's words echoed in her mind, the threat of the guild hanging\nover her like a dark cloud. She couldn't shake the feeling that no matter what\nshe chose, it would change everything.\nShe knelt before the shrine, her hands resting on the cool stone as she closed\nher eyes and let her thoughts drift. What would it mean to join the guild?\nCould she trust them? Could she trust herself with the power they promised to\ngive her? And if she refused, what consequences would she face?\nA rustling sound in the underbrush startled her, and she opened her eyes to see\na figure emerging from the shadows. Maelis stood at the edge of the clearing,\nwatching her with an unreadable expression. \"You're thinking about it, aren't\nyou?\" he said, his voice low and smooth.\nElara stood, her heart pounding in her chest. \"You followed me.\"\nMaelis smiled, though there was no humor in it. \"I'm not here to pressure you,\nElara. I'm here to remind you of the reality you face. The guild can offer you\na way to control your gift, to use it for more than just small changes in a\nvillage square. You could shape the world.\"\nElara's jaw tightened. \"But at what cost?\"\nMaelis's eyes darkened. \"Every choice has a cost. But what is freedom if you\ncannot control your own fate?\"\nShe hesitated, the weight of his words pressing down on her. The idea of\ncontrol was tempting\u2014terrifying, but tempting. \"I need time to think,\" she\nsaid, her voice wavering slightly.\nMaelis nodded, though his gaze remained sharp. \"Take all the time you need. But\ndon't wait too long. Fate waits for no one.\"",

It was simple, a peaceful village scene, but she knew it\nrepresented so much more than that. It represented the life she had built here,\nthe quiet simplicity of it, the connections she had with the people around her.\nJoining the guild would mean leaving all of that behind.\nA soft knock at the door drew her from her thoughts, and she turned to see Nira\nstanding in the doorway, her face lined with concern. \"Have you made your\ndecision?\" Nira asked quietly.\nElara shook her head. \"I don't know what to do. If I join the guild, I'll have\ncontrol over my gift. But if I stay, I'll always be afraid of it, afraid of\nwhat I might do.\"\nNira stepped into the room, her eyes filled with a deep sadness. \"The guild may\noffer control, but it comes at a price. They will use you, Elara. They will\nshape you to fit their needs. And once you're part of them, there is no escape.\"\nElara felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes. \"But I don't know if I can\nhandle this on my own. I've already caused so much damage.\"\nNira's expression softened, and she placed a gentle hand on Elara's cheek. \"You\nare stronger than you know. You have the power to choose your own path, to\ndecide how you want to use your gift. The guild doesn't own your fate. You do.\"\nElara blinked back the tears, her heart aching with the weight of her decision.\n\"I'm scared, Grandmother.\"\nNira smiled, her eyes soft. \"We all are, child. But fear is not the enemy. It's\nwhat we do with it that matters.\"\nElara took a deep breath, her resolve hardening. She knew what she had to do.\nThe guild had come for her, offering power and control, but they couldn't offer\nher the one thing she valued most: her freedom.\n\"I won't join them,\" she whispered, the words steady and firm.\nNira nodded, her eyes filled with pride. \"Then you have already chosen the\nright path.\"",

The\ndecision to reject the guild's offer had been clear, but what lay ahead was\nanything but. She could feel the weight of Maelis's presence lingering like a\nshadow in her life, a reminder that the guild would not give up so easily. Even\nnow, the threads beneath her fingers seemed to pull her in directions she could\nnot fully control, as if fate itself were resisting her choice.\nSuddenly, the door to her cottage creaked open, and Elara looked up to see\nMaelis standing in the threshold, his expression unreadable. She stood quickly,\nher pulse quickening. She hadn't expected him to return so soon, not after she\nhad refused his offer.\n\"You've made your decision, then,\" Maelis said, his voice smooth, though there\nwas a coldness in his tone that hadn't been there before.\n\"I have,\" Elara replied, her voice steadier than she felt. \"I don't want any\npart of the guild.\"\nMaelis stepped inside, his eyes narrowing as he studied her. \"You think you can\ncontrol your gift on your own? You think you can defy the will of the guild?\"\nElara's heart pounded in her chest, but she stood her ground. \"I don't need the\nguild. I'll find my own way.\"\nMaelis's smile was thin, almost mocking. \"You are playing a dangerous game,\nElara. The guild has been weaving the fate of this world for centuries. We do\nnot take kindly to defiance.\"\nElara swallowed hard, her throat tight with fear. \"I'm not trying to defy\nanyone. I just want to be free.\"\nMaelis's expression darkened, and he stepped closer, his presence filling the\nroom. \"Freedom is an illusion. You think you can control fate, but fate\ncontrols you. The guild understands this. You do not.\"\nElara's pulse quickened, but she met his gaze with as much resolve as she could\nmuster. \"I understand enough to know that I won't be controlled by you.\"\nMaelis's eyes flashed with something\u2014anger, perhaps, or something deeper,\ndarker. \"Very well,\" he said, his voice low and dangerous. \"But know this,\nElara: the guild does not forget. And it does not forgive.\"\nBefore she could respond, Maelis turned and strode out of the cottage, leaving\nher standing there, her hands trembling.

The sky above was overcast, casting a gray\npall over the village that mirrored the unease swirling inside her. She had\nreturned from the guild with more questions than answers, and now, as she\nlooked around at the familiar faces of her neighbors, she couldn't help but\nwonder if her weaving had already begun to unravel their lives in ways she\ncouldn't control.\nThe villagers went about their business, but something was off. The tension in\nthe air was palpable, a quiet current of suspicion and distrust running through\nevery interaction. Elara had hoped her small weavings\u2014her attempts to ease\ntensions\u2014would help, but it seemed that the opposite was happening. The more\nshe tried to fix things, the worse they became.\nAs she made her way toward the market stalls, she caught sight of Mayor Felin\nspeaking with a group of villagers. His expression was stern, his voice low but\ninsistent. Elara couldn't hear what he was saying, but the looks on the\nvillagers' faces\u2014fear, doubt, anger\u2014made her stomach churn.\nShe took a deep breath and approached, hoping to diffuse the situation before\nit spiraled further out of control. \"Mayor Felin,\" she called, her voice steady\ndespite the unease gnawing at her.\nFelin turned to face her, his eyes narrowing. \"Elara,\" he said, his tone\nclipped. \"I was just speaking with some of the villagers about the... strange\nevents we've been experiencing.\"\nElara's heart skipped a beat. She knew what he was referring to. The crops\nfailing, the animals falling ill, the fires in Glenth\u2014everything pointed to her\nweaving, even if unintentionally. \"I've been trying to help,\" she said quietly,\nglancing around at the gathered crowd. \"But I never meant for any of this to\nhappen.\"\nFelin crossed his arms, his gaze hardening. \"You mean well, Elara. But you have\nto understand, people are scared. They've seen what happens when fate is\ntampered with.\"\nElara's throat tightened, and she nodded. \"I know. I've been trying to control\nit, but...\"\n\"But it's out of your hands,\" Felin finished for her, his voice grim. \"That's\nwhat we're afraid of.\"\nThe crowd murmured in agreement, their eyes fixed on Elara with a mix of\nsuspicion and fear. She felt a wave of guilt wash over her. Everything she had\ndone\u2014everything she had tried to fix\u2014was slipping away from her grasp. And now,\nit seemed, the village itself was turning against her.",

The loom had controlled the fate of the\nworld for centuries, and in a single moment, she had undone it all. The weight\nof her decision pressed down on her, making it hard to breathe.\nValeria stepped forward, her face calm but her eyes filled with quiet\nadmiration. \"You did it,\" she said softly, her voice breaking the silence. \"You\nset the world free.\"\nElara turned to her, her chest tight. \"I don't know what comes next,\" she\nadmitted, her voice trembling. \"I've undone so much.

It will be difficult at first, but in the end, this was the right thing\nto do.\"\nElara nodded, though her heart still felt heavy.

But\nwithout the loom, they won't have the same power. The guild as it was is over.\"\nElara's gaze drifted to the shattered remains of the loom. The guild had been\nher enemy, but now that their power was broken, she couldn't help but feel a\npang of sadness. So much had been lost\u2014so much history, so much tradition.
