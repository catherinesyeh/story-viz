She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.\nHe could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind\nor body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\neverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\ntemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\nsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\nreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\nthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\nIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\nand give her pleasant society again.\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\nname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were\nfirst in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for\neven half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but\nsigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,\nand made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He\nwas a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was\nused to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.\nMatrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was\nby no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could\never speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a\nmatch of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor\ntoo; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able\nto suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he\nwas very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for\nherself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she\nhad spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and\nchatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but\nwhen tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had\nsaid at dinner,\n\"Poor Miss Taylor!\u2014I wish she were here again.

I am afraid you must\nhave had a shocking walk.\"\n\"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\nmust draw back from your great fire.\"\n\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\ncatch cold.\"\n\"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.\"\n\"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"\n\"By the bye\u2014I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\nsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\nall behave? Who cried most?\"\n\"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.\"\n\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\n'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\ncomes to the question of dependence or independence!\u2014At any rate, it\nmust be better to have only one to please than two.\"\n\"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\ncreature!\" said Emma playfully. \"That is what you have in your head, I\nknow\u2014and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"\n\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, with\na sigh. \"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"\n\"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\nKnightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know\u2014in a\njoke\u2014it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.\"\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\nin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\nthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it\nwould be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\nreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\nevery body.\n\"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I meant no\nreflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be\na gainer.\"\n\"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass\u2014\"you want to hear about the\nwedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:\nnot a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that\nwe were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting\nevery day.\"\n\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father. \"But, Mr.\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\nsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\"\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. \"It is\nimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\" said Mr.\nKnightley. \"We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.\"",

I made the match,\nyou know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in\nthe right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,\nmay comfort me for any thing.\"\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, \"Ah! my\ndear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\nmatches.\"\n\"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\nother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\nsuccess, you know!\u2014Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful\u2014Mr. Weston need not spend\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\nWeston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\n\"Ever since the day\u2014about four years ago\u2014that Miss Taylor and I met\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\nFarmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the\nmatch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this\ninstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off\nmatch-making.\"\n\"I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'\" said Mr. Knightley.\n\"Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But\nif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,\nmeans only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I\nthink it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were\nto marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then\nafterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are\nyou proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be\nsaid.\"\n\"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?\u2014I\npity you.\u2014I thought you cleverer\u2014for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor\nword 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\nbut I think there may be a third\u2014a something between the do-nothing and\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\nnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\nenough to comprehend that.\"\n\"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\ngood to them, by interference.\"\n\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\" rejoined\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. \"But, my dear, pray do not\nmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family\ncircle grievously.\"\n\"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\nElton, papa,\u2014I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\nHighbury who deserves him\u2014and he has been here a whole year, and has\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have\nhim single any longer\u2014and I thought when he was joining their hands\nto-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same\nkind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is\nthe only way I have of doing him a service.\"",

Had it taken place only once a year, it\nwould have been a grievance.\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was\ndevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a\nsmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and\na woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal\ngood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved\nevery body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to\nevery body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and\nsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good\nneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The\nsimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful\nspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to\nherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly\nsuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\ngossip.\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School\u2014not of a seminary, or an\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant\nmorality, upon new principles and new systems\u2014and where young ladies\nfor enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity\u2014but a\nreal, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where\ngirls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into\na little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.\nGoddard's school was in high repute\u2014and very deservedly; for Highbury\nwas reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and\ngarden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about\na great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with\nher own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now\nwalked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to\nthe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to\nMr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her\nneat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win\nor lose a few sixpences by his fireside.",

This was all that was generally known of her history.\nShe had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\nwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\nladies who had been at school there with her.\nShe was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\nwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\nfine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of\ngreat sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much\npleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to\ncontinue the acquaintance.\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging\u2014not\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk\u2014and yet so far from pushing,\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by\nthe appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\nbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\nEncouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\nnatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of\nHighbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed\nwere unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though\nvery good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of\nthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a\nlarge farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell\u2014very\ncreditably, she believed\u2014she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\nthem\u2014but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\nintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and\nelegance to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve\nher; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\ninto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.

With an alacrity beyond the common\nimpulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of\ndoing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a\nmind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of\nthe meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped\noysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the\nearly hours and civil scruples of their guests.\nUpon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare.\nHe loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\nyouth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\nrather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality\nwould have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their\nhealth made him grieve that they would eat.\nSuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he\ncould, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might\nconstrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer\nthings, to say:\n\"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\nboiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg\nbetter than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body\nelse; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see\u2014one of\nour small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a\n_little_ bit of tart\u2014a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You\nneed not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the\ncustard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A\n_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it\ncould disagree with you.\"\nEmma allowed her father to talk\u2014but supplied her visitors in a much\nmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\npleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\nquite equal to her intentions.

Quick\nand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\nand telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance\nincreased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking\ncompanion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\nIn that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never\nwent beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed\nhim for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.\nWeston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had\nventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet\nSmith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,\nwould be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect,\nas she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her\nkind designs.\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\nguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was\nvery amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\nappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want\nof taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\nAltogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the\nyoung friend she wanted\u2014exactly the something which her home required.\nSuch a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\nnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\nsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was\nthe object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\nHarriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs.\nWeston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.",

She had been satisfied to hear and believe just\nwhat Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.\nMrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\nschool in general, formed naturally a great part of the\nconversation\u2014and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\nAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole.

She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\ndaughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it\nappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\nalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\nsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\nMartin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were\nnot taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.",

Harriet was very ready to\nspeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\nevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very\ngood-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in\norder to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was\nof them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his\nshepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\nShe was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She\nbelieved he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very\nfine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his\nwool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well\nof him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had\ntold her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was\nimpossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,\nwhenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she\n_wanted_ him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.\n\"Well done, Mrs. Martin!\" thought Emma. \"You know what you are about.\"\n\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose\u2014the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\nseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\nher.\"\n\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\nhis own business? He does not read?\"\n\"Oh yes!\u2014that is, no\u2014I do not know\u2014but I believe he has read a good\ndeal\u2014but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the\nwindow seats\u2014but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an\nevening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of\nthe Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the\nVicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The\nChildren of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I\nmentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he\ncan.\"\nThe next question was\u2014\n\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"\n\"Oh! not handsome\u2014not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now\nand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to\nKingston. He has passed you very often.\"\n\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\nis the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to\ndo. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest\nme; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.\nBut a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,\nas much above my notice as in every other he is below it.\"\n\"To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed\nhim; but he knows you very well indeed\u2014I mean by sight.\"\n\"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\nhis age to be?\"\n\"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\n23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference\u2014which is very odd.\"\n\"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as\nthey are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would\nprobably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort\nof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it\nmight be very desirable.\"\n\"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\"\n\"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are\nnot born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune\nentirely to make\u2014cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever\nmoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of\nthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his\nstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may\nbe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised\nany thing yet.\"\n\"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\nof taking a boy another year.\"\n\"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\nmarry;\u2014I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife\u2014for though his\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\ncareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\ngentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station\nby every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people",

He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\nher, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\nnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\nyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\nsufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\nneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\nother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she\nthought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet's\ninclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\nnoticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\nMartin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\nkept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\nand in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\ncompose.\n\"Only think of our happening to meet him!\u2014How very odd! It was quite a\nchance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\nthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\nmost days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\nHe was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot\nit, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet!\nWell, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think\nof him? Do you think him so very plain?\"\n\"He is very plain, undoubtedly\u2014remarkably plain:\u2014but that is nothing\ncompared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\nvery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\ndegree or two nearer gentility.\"\n\"To be sure,\" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \"he is not so genteel\nas real gentlemen.\"\n\"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At\nHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred\nmen. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in\ncompany with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very\ninferior creature\u2014and rather wondering at yourself for having ever\nthought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?\nWere not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward\nlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to\nbe wholly unmodulated as I stood here.\"",

Exactly so. No husbands and wives,\" with so interesting a\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a\nwhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable\nstation over the mantelpiece.\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\nkeeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\nyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\ndoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\ntouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\nand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\nit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\nto employ him in reading.\n\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith's.\"\nMr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\nShe must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing\nless would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready\nat the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the\nprogress, and be charmed.\u2014There was no being displeased with such an\nencourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost\nbefore it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and\nhis complaisance were unexceptionable.\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\npleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\nto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its\nbeing in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its\ndestined place with credit to them both\u2014a standing memorial of the\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with\nas many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising\nattachment was likely to add.",

My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\ndoubt as to that? I thought\u2014but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\nunder a mistake.

If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No'\ndirectly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful\nfeelings, with half a heart.

The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had\nsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace\nher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much\nconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of\nwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\nthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the\nyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been\naccepted after all.\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.

He came to ask me whether I\nthought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I\nthought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\nbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son\nand brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to\nme that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\nhim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had.

My only scruple in advising the match was on\nhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.\nI felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;\nand that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do\nworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to\ntrust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of\ndisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright\nand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on\nher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\nwould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_\nsatisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you\nwould not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her\nbeing settled so well. I remember saying to myself, 'Even Emma, with\nall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'\"\n\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\nany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\nwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you\nshould think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you\nmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.\nYou are not just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very\ndifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\nof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\nsociety.\u2014The sphere in which she moves is much above his.\u2014It would be a\ndegradation.\"\n\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\"\n\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\nwhom she is brought up.\u2014There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\nis a gentleman\u2014and a gentleman of fortune.\u2014Her allowance is very\nliberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\ncomfort.\u2014That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that\nshe associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\ndeny.\u2014She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"",

The possibility\nof the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting\nwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\nreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\nwoman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\nwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite\nof Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on\nsuch a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,\nshe was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished\nresentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly\nmight have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever\ndone, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate\ndisposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive\nthan otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due\nallowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all\ninterested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course\nthought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a\ndoubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence\nmight originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree\nof prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\nHarriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\nLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\nto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\n_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very\nenviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very\nsure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr.\nElton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great\nspirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal\nmore about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\n\"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but\nshe only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should\nthink the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton",

It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\nwho might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He\nis so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses\u2014'To Miss \u2014\u2014\u2014.'\nDear me, how clever!\u2014Could it really be meant for me?\"\n\"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a\ncertainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the\nplay, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\nmatter-of-fact prose.\"\n\"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a\nmonth ago, I had no more idea myself!\u2014The strangest things do take\nplace!\"\n\"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted\u2014they do indeed\u2014and\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so\nevidently, so palpably desirable\u2014what courts the pre-arrangement of\nother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\nanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\nwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\nsomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\ndirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.\nThe course of true love never did run smooth\u2014\nA Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\npassage.\"\n\"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,\u2014me, of all people,\nwho did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\nhandsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,\nquite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body\nsays he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;\nthat he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so\nexcellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has\never preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back\nto the first time I saw him! How little did I think!\u2014The two Abbots and\nI ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\nwas going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\nthrough herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look\ntoo, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\nlooked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\"\n\"This is an alliance which, whoever\u2014whatever your friends may be, must\nbe agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\nare not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to\nsee you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives\nevery assurance of it;\u2014if they wish to have you settled in the same\ncountry and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will\nbe accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the\ncommon phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the\nrespectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy\nthem.\"",

This charade!\u2014If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have\nmade any thing like it.\"\n\"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\nyesterday.\"\n\"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\"\n\"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\"\n\"It is as long again as almost all we have had before.\"\n\"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such\nthings in general cannot be too short.\"\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\n\"It is one thing,\" said she, presently\u2014her cheeks in a glow\u2014\"to have\nvery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\nany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\nmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\nthis.\"\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's\nprose.\n\"Such sweet lines!\" continued Harriet\u2014\"these two last!\u2014But how shall I\never be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?\u2014Oh! Miss\nWoodhouse, what can we do about that?\"\n\"Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\npass between us, and you shall not be committed.\u2014Your soft eyes shall\nchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.\"\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.\"\n\"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should\nnot write it into your book.\"\n\"Oh! but those two lines are\"\u2014\n\u2014\"The best of all. Granted;\u2014for private enjoyment; and for private\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\nvery pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend\nupon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better\nthan his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities,\nor neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can\nbe no possible reflection on you.\"\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so\nas to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\ndeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\nof publicity.\n\"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\" said she.\n\"Very well,\" replied Emma; \"a most natural feeling; and the longer it\nlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\nwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\nso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\nthing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\ngallantry towards us all!\u2014You must let me read it to him.\"\nHarriet looked grave.\n\"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.\u2014You\nwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\nquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\nwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\nhave left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\nthan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\nencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\nthis charade.\"\n\"Oh! no\u2014I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.\"\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \"Well, my dears, how does\nyour book go on?\u2014Have you got any thing fresh?\"\n\"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning\u2014(dropt, we suppose,\nby a fairy)\u2014containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\nit in.\"\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\npart as she proceeded\u2014and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\n\"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.\n'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can\neasily guess what fairy brought it.\u2014Nobody could have written so\nprettily, but you, Emma.\"\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.\u2014After a little thinking, and a very\ntender sigh, he added,\n\"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\nremember nothing;\u2014not even that particular riddle which you have heard\nme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\nseveral.\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid,\nKindled a flame I yet deplore,\nThe hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,\nThough of his near approach afraid,\nSo fatal to my suit before.\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it\u2014but it is very clever all\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\"\n\"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.\"\n\"Aye, very true.\u2014I wish I could recollect more of it.\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid.\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her\u2014and what\nroom there will be for the children?\"\n\"Oh! yes\u2014she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\nhas;\u2014and there is the nursery for the children,\u2014just as usual, you\nknow. Why should there be any change?\"\n\"I do not know, my dear\u2014but it is so long since she was here!\u2014not since\nlast Easter, and then only for a few days.\u2014Mr. John Knightley's being a\nlawyer is very inconvenient.\u2014Poor Isabella!\u2014she is sadly taken away\nfrom us all!\u2014and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss\nTaylor here!\"\n\"She will not be surprized, papa, at least.\"\n\"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\nfirst heard she was going to be married.\"\n\"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\nhere.\"\n\"Yes, my dear, if there is time.\u2014But\u2014(in a very depressed tone)\u2014she is\ncoming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.\"\n\"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer\u2014but it seems a case of\nnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be\ntaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim\nthis Christmas\u2014though you know it is longer since they were with him,\nthan with us.\"\n\"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\nanywhere but at Hartfield.\"\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his\nbrother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat\nmusing a little while, and then said,\n\"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.\"\n\"Ah! papa\u2014that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do\nnot think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\nhusband.\"\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\nby the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she\nimmediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\n\"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my\nbrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the\nchildren. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder\nwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\"\n\"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\"\n\"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.\"",

            "text": "Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\nof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of\nMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,\nabout a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and\nnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\neyes.\u2014Emma's remark was\u2014\n\"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\ndays.\"\u2014Harriet's was\u2014\n\"Oh, what a sweet house!\u2014How very beautiful!\u2014There are the yellow\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\"\n\"I do not often walk this way _now_,\" said Emma, as they proceeded,\n\"but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of\nthis part of Highbury.\"\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and\nher curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and\nprobabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.\nElton's seeing ready wit in her.\n\"I wish we could contrive it,\" said she; \"but I cannot think of any\ntolerable pretence for going in;\u2014no servant that I want to inquire\nabout of his housekeeper\u2014no message from my father.\"\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of\nsome minutes, Harriet thus began again\u2014\n\"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!\"\u2014\nEmma laughed, and replied,\n\"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\nI must find other people charming\u2014one other person at least. And I am\nnot only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\nintention of ever marrying at all.\"\n\"Ah!\u2014so you say; but I cannot believe it.\"\n\"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather\nnot be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to\nmarry, I must expect to repent it.\"\n\"Dear me!\u2014it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\"\u2014\n\"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been\nin love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever\nshall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\nmistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never,\nnever could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always\nfirst and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.\"\n\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"\n\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly\u2014so satisfied\u2014so\nsmiling\u2014so prosing\u2014so undistinguishing and unfastidious\u2014and so apt to\ntell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.\"\n\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!\"\n\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable\nold maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of\ngood fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and\npleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much\nagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;\nfor a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour\nthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\nsmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\ncross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\ngood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\ncertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\nonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\nsixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.\"\n\"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\ngrow old?\"\n\"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\nto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be\nenough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation\nthat declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and\nevery fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a\nparent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and\nblinder. My nephews and nieces!\u2014I shall often have a niece with me.\"\n\"Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\na hundred times\u2014but are you acquainted?\"\n\"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter\nfrom her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go\nround and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of\na stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears\nof nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she\ntires me to death.\"\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\n\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\nevery thing else appear!\u2014I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?\"",

Her wish of shewing you attention could not\nbe doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all\neasy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of\nthe change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and\nnow you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.\"\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse\u2014\"yes, certainly\u2014I cannot deny\nthat Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\noften\u2014but then\u2014she is always obliged to go away again.\"\n\"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.\u2014You quite\nforget poor Mr. Weston.\"\n\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston has\nsome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of\nthe poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the\nclaims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for\nIsabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of\nputting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"\n\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.\u2014\n\"Are you talking about me?\u2014I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\ngreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\nthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of\nMiss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to\nslighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is\nnothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very\nbest-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your\nbrother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his\nflying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last Easter\u2014and ever\nsince his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing\nthat note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that\nthere was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could\nnot be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.\u2014If any body\ncan deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.\"\n\"Where is the young man?\" said John Knightley. \"Has he been here on\nthis occasion\u2014or has he not?\"\n\"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma. \"There was a strong\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\nnothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\"\n\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father. \"He\nwrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps\u2014\"\n\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\"\n\"Three-and-twenty!\u2014is he indeed?\u2014Well, I could not have thought it\u2014and\nhe was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does\nfly indeed!\u2014and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding\ngood, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of\npleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\n28th\u2014and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it\nwas signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'\u2014I remember that perfectly.\"\n\"How very pleasing and proper of him!\" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\nKnightley. \"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\nhow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\nsomething so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents\nand natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part\nwith him. To give up one's child! I really never could think well of\nany body who proposed such a thing to any body else.\"\n\"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\" observed Mr.\nJohn Knightley coolly. \"But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have\nfelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is\nrather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;\nhe takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow\nor other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society\nfor his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and\nplaying whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family\naffection, or any thing that home affords.\"",

They joined company and\nproceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's\ncomplaint;\u2014\"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\nabout her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\nGoddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\nalarmed her with them.\" Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\nhe exclaimed,\n\"A sore-throat!\u2014I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\nyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\nWhy does not Perry see her?\"\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and\ncare; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\ncould not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\nthan not, she added soon afterwards\u2014as if quite another subject,\n\"It is so cold, so very cold\u2014and looks and feels so very much like\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\nshould really try not to go out to-day\u2014and dissuade my father from\nventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel\nthe cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so\ngreat a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.\nElton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me\na little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\nwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\ncommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.\"\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\nwhich was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's,\nhe had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;\u2014but Emma,\ntoo eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear\nhim impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied\nwith his muttering acknowledgment of its being \"very cold, certainly\nvery cold,\" and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from\nRandalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet\nevery hour of the evening.",

It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\nmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to\nplease, every feature works.\"\n\"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there\nis a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a\ngreat deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\nwill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such\nperfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but\nvalue.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, \"he seems\nto have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"\n\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining me\nto be Mr. Elton's object?\"\n\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration\nnow.\"\n\"Mr. Elton in love with me!\u2014What an idea!\"\n\"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is\nso or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.\"\n\"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I\nare very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on, amusing\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of\nhigh pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very\nwell pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and\nin want of counsel. He said no more.\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\nspite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of\nshrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his\neldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness\nof the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his\nown going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it\nwas cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was\nsevere; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes\nof snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of\nbeing so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very\nwhite world in a very short time.\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\ndiscontent.\n\"A man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when he\nasks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\nabsurdity\u2014Actually snowing at this moment!\u2014The folly of not allowing\npeople to be comfortable at home\u2014and the folly of people's not staying\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an\nevening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\nshould deem it;\u2014and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\nthat he can;\u2014here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\nanother man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;\u2014four horses and\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\nat home.\"",

            "text": "Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never\nmarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank\nChurchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\nthought\u2014especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor\u2014that if\nshe _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\ncharacter and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\nfamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a\nmatch that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not\nmeaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\nchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided\nintention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain\ndegree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in\ntheir friends' imaginations.\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\ncross\u2014and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\npass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\nsubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.\u2014So it proved;\u2014for\nwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at\ndinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\nhospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say\nto her,\n\"We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to\nsee two more here,\u2014your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my\nson\u2014and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not\nhear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting\nFrank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us\nwithin a fortnight.\"\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\nhis proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their\nparty quite complete.\n\"He has been wanting to come to us,\" continued Mr. Weston, \"ever since\nSeptember: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\nown time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\nourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\nBut now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\nJanuary.\"\n\"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\nyourself.\"\n\"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\nShe does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\nknow the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is\u2014(but this is\nquite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the\nother room. There are secrets in all families, you know)\u2014The case is,\nthat a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in\nJanuary; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If\nthey are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it\nis a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has\na particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite\nthem once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes\nto the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as\nconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of\nbeing here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the\nupper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so\nlittle used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their\neffects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.\"",

Mr. Weston was chatty\nand convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at\nlast the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in\nvery good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and\nEmma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,\nwith scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the\nexpectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\nmaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\nfriendly smiles.\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend\u2014her fair,\nlovely, amiable friend. \"Did she know?\u2014had she heard any thing about\nher, since their being at Randalls?\u2014he felt much anxiety\u2014he must\nconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.\" And\nin this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\nattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the\nterror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if\nhe were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than\non Harriet's\u2014more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\nagain, for the present\u2014to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\nthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\nproper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\nabout her. She was vexed. It did appear\u2014there was no concealing\nit\u2014exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\nHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\nand she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs.\nWeston to implore her assistance, \"Would not she give him her\nsupport?\u2014would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss\nWoodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss\nSmith's disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a\npromise\u2014would not she give him her influence in procuring it?\"\n\"So scrupulous for others,\" he continued, \"and yet so careless for\nherself!

Mrs. Weston and\nEmma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\nson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\n\"I admired your resolution very much, sir,\" said he, \"in venturing out\nin such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\nEvery body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit;\nand I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow\ncan hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one\nis blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the\nother at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before\nmidnight.\"\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it\nshould make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid\nthey would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,\nthat he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\ngood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\n\"What is to be done, my dear Emma?\u2014what is to be done?\" was Mr.\nWoodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.\nTo her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\nHis eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\nin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\nadventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was\neager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at\nRandalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all\nthe possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\n\"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she; \"I\ndare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if\nwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at\nall afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my\nshoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing\nthat gives me cold.\"\n\"Indeed!\" replied he. \"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\ndoes give you cold. Walk home!\u2014you are prettily shod for walking home,\nI dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.\"\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\nand they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\nleft the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow,\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to\nexamine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty\nin their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour\nhence. He had gone beyond the sweep\u2014some way along the Highbury\nroad\u2014the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep\u2014in many places hardly\nenough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present,\nbut the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its\nbeing soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with\nhim in there being nothing to apprehend.\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\nscarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who was\nimmediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\nreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\nto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus\u2014\n\"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?\"\n\"I am ready, if the others are.\"\n\"Shall I ring the bell?\"\n\"Yes, do.\"\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.

It would not have been\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\nhim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\none. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he\nwould want to be talking nonsense.\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\nthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\nthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\nfound her subject cut up\u2014her hand seized\u2014her attention demanded, and\nMr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the\nprecious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well\nknown, hoping\u2014fearing\u2014adoring\u2014ready to die if she refused him; but\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\nreally was so. Without scruple\u2014without apology\u2014without much apparent\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\nreplied,\n\"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\nyourself\u2014you take me for my friend\u2014any message to Miss Smith I shall be\nhappy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\"\n\"Miss Smith!\u2014message to Miss Smith!\u2014What could she possibly mean!\"\u2014And\nhe repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\npretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\n\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\"\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\nall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,\u2014but\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,\u2014he\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\nfavourable answer.\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\nreplied,\n\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\nmonth, to Miss Smith\u2014such attentions as I have been in the daily habit\nof observing\u2014to be addressing me in this manner\u2014this is an unsteadiness\nof character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,\nsir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such\nprofessions.\"\n\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?\u2014Miss\nSmith!\u2014I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\nexistence\u2014never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has\nfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\nsorry\u2014extremely sorry\u2014But, Miss Smith, indeed!\u2014Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who\ncan think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself.

No!\u2014(in an accent meant to be\ninsinuating)\u2014I am sure you have seen and understood me.\"\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this\u2014which of\nall her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\noverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\nbeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he\ntried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed\u2014\n\"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\nsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.\"\n\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing. So far from having\nlong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\nshould have been giving way to any feelings\u2014Nothing could be farther\nfrom my wishes\u2014your attachment to my friend Harriet\u2014your pursuit of\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were\nnot your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you\njudged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you\nhave never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss\nSmith?\u2014that you have never thought seriously of her?\"\n\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn: \"never, I assure you.\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!\u2014Miss Smith is a very good sort of\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her\nextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\nto\u2014Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!\u2014No, madam, my\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement\nI received\u2014\"\n\"Encouragement!\u2014I give you encouragement!\u2014Sir, you have been entirely\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\ntrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at\npresent.\"\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\nsupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\ndeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\nfor the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\nthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\nawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\nlittle zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\nturned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,\nall at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\nsyllable passed.\u2014Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\nnight. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\nindescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to",

Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\nother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she\nwould gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken\u2014more in\nerror\u2014more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\neffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\n\"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne\nany thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me\u2014but poor\nHarriet!\"\nHow she could have been so deceived!\u2014He protested that he had never\nthought seriously of Harriet\u2014never! She looked back as well as she\ncould; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\nsupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\nhave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\nmisled.\nThe picture!\u2014How eager he had been about the picture!\u2014and the\ncharade!\u2014and an hundred other circumstances;\u2014how clearly they had\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its \"ready\nwit\"\u2014but then the \"soft eyes\"\u2014in fact it suited neither; it was a\njumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\nthick-headed nonsense?\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\nthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\nhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the\nconviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It was\ndreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\nconcerned about the feelings of others.\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she\nwas perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need\nbe cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language\nor manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she\ncould hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\nless allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him.\nHe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\nelse with twenty, or with ten.\nBut\u2014that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\nhim!\u2014should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!\u2014look down\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\npresumption in addressing her!\u2014It was most provoking.\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know\nthat the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family\u2014and that the\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\ninconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses\nhad long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood\nwhich Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as\nhe could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend\nhim to notice but his situation and his civility.\u2014But he had fancied\nher in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and\nadmit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\ndelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\nhers.\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought\nto be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\nconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\n\"Here have I,\" said she, \"actually talked poor Harriet into being very\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her\nnot to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\nof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel\nthis disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any\nbody else who would be at all desirable for her;\u2014William Coxe\u2014Oh! no, I\ncould not endure William Coxe\u2014a pert young lawyer.\"\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a\nmore serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might\nbe, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to\nHarriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the\nawkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or\ndiscontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing\nresentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most\nunmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last\nwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most\ndreadfully.",

The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\nand of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough\nto keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\nsoftened pain and brighter hope.\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\nto bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\ndepend on getting tolerably out of it.\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love\nwith her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\ndisappoint him\u2014that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior\nsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive\u2014and that there\ncould be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the\nthree principals, and especially for her father's being given a\nmoment's uneasiness about it.\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of\nsnow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome\nthat might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.\nThe weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\ncould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\ndaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\nor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\nwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\nthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\nmorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\nfreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No\nintercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on\nSunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for\nMr. Elton's absenting himself.\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and\nthough she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some\nsociety or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well\nsatisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir\nout; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep\nentirely from them,\u2014\n\"Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\"\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his\ncompanions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\nill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during\nthe rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and\nobliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes\nof cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still\nsuch an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet,",

            "text": "She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite\nas much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\nmore,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\nproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\nsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\nlooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\nsight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\nChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\nwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\ntaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\nuse of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.\n\"The Churchills are very likely in fault,\" said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\n\"but I dare say he might come if he would.\"\n\"I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come;\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him.\"\n\"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\npoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.\"\n\"How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature?\"\n\"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very\nlittle for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who\nhave always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural\nthan one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are\nproud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish\ntoo. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have\ncontrived it between September and January. A man at his age\u2014what is\nhe?\u2014three or four-and-twenty\u2014cannot be without the means of doing as\nmuch as that. It is impossible.\"\n\"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\nown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\nto manage.\"\n\"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\nmoney\u2014he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts\nin the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or\nother. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can\nleave the Churchills.\"\n\"Yes, sometimes he can.\"\n\"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.\"\n\"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\nfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\nChurchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can\nat others.\"\n\"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill\u2014'Every sacrifice of mere\npleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but\nI must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my\nfailing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I\nshall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'\u2014If he would say so to her at\nonce, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\nopposition made to his going.\"\n\"No,\" said Emma, laughing; \"but perhaps there might be some made to his\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\nuse!\u2014Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite\nto your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\nhim!\u2014Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\nloud as he could!\u2014How can you imagine such conduct practicable?\"\n\"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\nHe would feel himself in the right; and the declaration\u2014made, of\ncourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner\u2014would do\nhim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the\npeople he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients\ncan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that\nthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his\nfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as\nwell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his\nfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their\nhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.\nRespect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in\nthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their\nlittle minds would bend to his.\"\n\"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they\nhave a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as\ngreat ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were\nto be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's\nsituation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been\nrecommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The\nChurchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would\nhave no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.\nTo him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\nperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and\nregard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,\nas you can have, without being so equal, under particular\ncircumstances, to act up to it.\"\n\"Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.\"\n\"Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\nopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\nlife.\"\n\"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\nwill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\nfollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\nthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\nought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\ntheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\nside to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\nwould have been no difficulty now.\"\n\"We shall never agree about him,\" cried Emma; \"but that is nothing\nextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\nthough in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\ncomplying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's\nperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\nadvantages, it will secure him many others.\"\n\"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of\nleading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\nexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\nflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\nhimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\npreserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right\nto complain. His letters disgust me.\"\n\"Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.\"\n\"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a\nwoman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's\nplace, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her\naccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\nfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\nwould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he\ndid or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\nconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\nherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in\nFrench, not in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good\nmanners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy\ntowards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about\nhim.\"\n\"You seem determined to think ill of him.\"\n\"Me!\u2014not at all,\" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \"I do not\nwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his\nmerits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely\npersonal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\nplausible manners.\"\n\"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\nat Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\nagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\nbargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\ncoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\nparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest\u2014one object of\ncuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\nof nobody else.\"\n\"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\"\n\"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\nand so on to every body, having that general information on all\nsubjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead,\njust as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each;\nthat is my idea of him.\"\n\"And mine,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"is, that if he turn out any\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company\u2014the great man\u2014the\npractised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make\nevery body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\nbe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\nfools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could\nnot endure such a puppy when it came to the point.\"\n\"I will say no more about him,\" cried Emma, \"you turn every thing to\nevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.\"",
