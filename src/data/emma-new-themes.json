The Woodhouses were\nfirst in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for\neven half a day.

I made the match,\nyou know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in\nthe right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,\nmay comfort me for any thing.\"\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, \"Ah! my\ndear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\nmatches.\"\n\"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\nother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\nsuccess, you know!\u2014Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful\u2014Mr. Weston need not spend\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\nWeston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\n\"Ever since the day\u2014about four years ago\u2014that Miss Taylor and I met\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\nFarmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the\nmatch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this\ninstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off\nmatch-making.\"\n\"I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'\" said Mr. Knightley.\n\"Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But\nif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,\nmeans only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I\nthink it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were\nto marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then\nafterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are\nyou proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be\nsaid.\"\n\"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?\u2014I\npity you.\u2014I thought you cleverer\u2014for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor\nword 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\nbut I think there may be a third\u2014a something between the do-nothing and\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\nnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\nenough to comprehend that.\"\n\"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\ngood to them, by interference.\"\n\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\" rejoined\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. \"But, my dear, pray do not\nmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family\ncircle grievously.\"\n\"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\nElton, papa,\u2014I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\nHighbury who deserves him\u2014and he has been here a whole year, and has\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have\nhim single any longer\u2014and I thought when he was joining their hands\nto-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same\nkind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is\nthe only way I have of doing him a service.\"",

Had it taken place only once a year, it\nwould have been a grievance.\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was\ndevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a\nsmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and\na woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal\ngood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved\nevery body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to\nevery body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and\nsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good\nneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The\nsimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful\nspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to\nherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly\nsuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\ngossip.\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School\u2014not of a seminary, or an\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant\nmorality, upon new principles and new systems\u2014and where young ladies\nfor enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity\u2014but a\nreal, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where\ngirls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into\na little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.\nGoddard's school was in high repute\u2014and very deservedly; for Highbury\nwas reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and\ngarden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about\na great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with\nher own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now\nwalked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to\nthe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to\nMr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her\nneat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win\nor lose a few sixpences by his fireside.",

She was short, plump, and fair, with a\nfine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of\ngreat sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much\npleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to\ncontinue the acquaintance.\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging\u2014not\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk\u2014and yet so far from pushing,\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by\nthe appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\nbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\nEncouragement should be given.

Quick\nand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\nand telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance\nincreased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking\ncompanion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\nIn that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never\nwent beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed\nhim for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.\nWeston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had\nventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet\nSmith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,\nwould be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect,\nas she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her\nkind designs.\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\nguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was\nvery amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\nappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want\nof taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\nAltogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the\nyoung friend she wanted\u2014exactly the something which her home required.\nSuch a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\nnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\nsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was\nthe object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\nHarriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.

Harriet was very ready to\nspeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\nevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very\ngood-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in\norder to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was\nof them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his\nshepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\nShe was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She\nbelieved he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very\nfine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his\nwool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well\nof him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had\ntold her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was\nimpossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,\nwhenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she\n_wanted_ him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.\n\"Well done, Mrs. Martin!\" thought Emma. \"You know what you are about.\"\n\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose\u2014the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\nseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\nher.\"\n\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\nhis own business? He does not read?\"\n\"Oh yes!\u2014that is, no\u2014I do not know\u2014but I believe he has read a good\ndeal\u2014but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the\nwindow seats\u2014but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an\nevening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of\nthe Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the\nVicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The\nChildren of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I\nmentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he\ncan.\"\nThe next question was\u2014\n\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"\n\"Oh! not handsome\u2014not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now\nand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to\nKingston. He has passed you very often.\"\n\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\nis the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to\ndo. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest\nme; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.\nBut a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,\nas much above my notice as in every other he is below it.\"\n\"To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed\nhim; but he knows you very well indeed\u2014I mean by sight.\"\n\"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\nhis age to be?\"\n\"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\n23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference\u2014which is very odd.\"\n\"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as\nthey are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would\nprobably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort\nof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it\nmight be very desirable.\"\n\"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\"\n\"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are\nnot born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune\nentirely to make\u2014cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever\nmoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of\nthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his\nstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may\nbe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised\nany thing yet.\"\n\"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\nof taking a boy another year.\"\n\"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\nmarry;\u2014I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife\u2014for though his\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\ncareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\ngentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station\nby every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people",

I had no right to expect\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\nvery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\ndegree or two nearer gentility.\"\n\"To be sure,\" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \"he is not so genteel\nas real gentlemen.\"\n\"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At\nHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred\nmen. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in\ncompany with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very\ninferior creature\u2014and rather wondering at yourself for having ever\nthought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?\nWere not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward\nlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to\nbe wholly unmodulated as I stood here.\"",

Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\"\n\"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will\nexpress yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your\nnot being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\nunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and\nconcern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\npresent themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\nnot be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\ndisappointment.\"\n\"You think I ought to refuse him then,\" said Harriet, looking down.\n\"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\ndoubt as to that? I thought\u2014but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\nunder a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you\nfeel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you\nwere consulting me only as to the wording of it.\"\nHarriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\n\"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\"\n\"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean\u2014What shall I do? What would you\nadvise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to\ndo.\"\n\"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\nwith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\"\n\"I had no notion that he liked me so very much,\" said Harriet,\ncontemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\nsilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\nletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\n\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\nto whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to\nrefuse him. If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No'\ndirectly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful\nfeelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and\nolder than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I\nwant to influence you.\"",

Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him.\nBut how shall I do? What shall I say?\"\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and\nadvised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of\nher assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any\nassistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every\nsentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had\nsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace\nher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much\nconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of\nwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\nthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the\nyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been\naccepted after all.\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\nwas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\nEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them\nby speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the\nidea of Mr. Elton.\n\"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\" was said in rather a\nsorrowful tone.\n\"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\nare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to\nAbbey-Mill.\"\n\"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy\nbut at Hartfield.\"\nSome time afterwards it was, \"I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\nsurprized if she knew what had happened.

I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\nopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\nvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\nis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\namong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are\nthe only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\nthemselves.\"\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\npeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.\n\"Now he has got my letter,\" said she softly. \"I wonder what they are\nall doing\u2014whether his sisters know\u2014if he is unhappy, they will be\nunhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.\"\n\"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\nemployed,\" cried Emma. \"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\nyour picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\nallowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\"\n\"My picture!\u2014But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\"\n\"Has he so!\u2014Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton.

It is his companion all this\nevening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\nit introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\npleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\nprepossession.

He told me every\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son\nand brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to\nme that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\nhim away very happy.

Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\nHarriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as\nparlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a\ngirl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too\nyoung and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she\ncan have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely\never to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good\ntempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on\nhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.\nI felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;\nand that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do\nworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to\ntrust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of\ndisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright\nand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on\nher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\nwould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_\nsatisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you\nwould not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her\nbeing settled so well. I remember saying to myself, 'Even Emma, with\nall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'\"\n\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\nany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\nwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you\nshould think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you\nmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.\nYou are not just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very\ndifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\nof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\nsociety.\u2014The sphere in which she moves is much above his.\u2014It would be a\ndegradation.\"\n\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\"\n\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\nwhom she is brought up.\u2014There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\nis a gentleman\u2014and a gentleman of fortune.\u2014Her allowance is very\nliberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\ncomfort.\u2014That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that\nshe associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\ndeny.\u2014She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"",

She\ndid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\njudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\nbut yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\nwhich made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\nsitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\nSome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\non Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\nthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\n\"Robert Martin has no great loss\u2014if he can but think so; and I hope it\nwill not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\nto yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it\nis fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;\u2014and as\na friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\nwill be all labour in vain.\"\nEmma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\n\"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\nan imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\nbody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\nas well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet's.\nHe knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\nwherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\nmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\nnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\nanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\nintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.\"\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again. \"If I had\nset my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very\nkind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\nmyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.\"\n\"Good morning to you,\"\u2014said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\nvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\nmortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he\nhad given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the\naffair, was provoking him exceedingly.",

The possibility\nof the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting\nwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\nreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\nwoman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\nwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite\nof Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on\nsuch a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,\nshe was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished\nresentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly\nmight have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever\ndone, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate\ndisposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive\nthan otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due\nallowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all\ninterested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course\nthought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a\ndoubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence\nmight originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree\nof prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\nHarriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\nLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\nto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\n_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very\nenviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very\nsure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr.\nElton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great\nspirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal\nmore about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\n\"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but\nshe only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should\nthink the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton",

      "text": "\"Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You\nunderstand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the\nother. This charade!\u2014If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have\nmade any thing like it.\"\n\"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\nyesterday.\"\n\"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\"\n\"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\"\n\"It is as long again as almost all we have had before.\"\n\"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such\nthings in general cannot be too short.\"\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\n\"It is one thing,\" said she, presently\u2014her cheeks in a glow\u2014\"to have\nvery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\nany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\nmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\nthis.\"\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's\nprose.\n\"Such sweet lines!\" continued Harriet\u2014\"these two last!\u2014But how shall I\never be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?\u2014Oh! Miss\nWoodhouse, what can we do about that?\"\n\"Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\npass between us, and you shall not be committed.\u2014Your soft eyes shall\nchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.\"\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.\"\n\"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should\nnot write it into your book.\"\n\"Oh! but those two lines are\"\u2014\n\u2014\"The best of all. Granted;\u2014for private enjoyment; and for private\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\nvery pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend\nupon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better\nthan his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities,\nor neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can\nbe no possible reflection on you.\"\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so\nas to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\ndeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\nof publicity.\n\"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\" said she.\n\"Very well,\" replied Emma; \"a most natural feeling; and the longer it\nlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\nwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\nso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\nthing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\ngallantry towards us all!\u2014You must let me read it to him.\"\nHarriet looked grave.\n\"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.\u2014You\nwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\nquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\nwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\nhave left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\nthan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\nencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\nthis charade.\"\n\"Oh! no\u2014I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.\"\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \"Well, my dears, how does\nyour book go on?\u2014Have you got any thing fresh?\"\n\"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning\u2014(dropt, we suppose,\nby a fairy)\u2014containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\nit in.\"\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\npart as she proceeded\u2014and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\n\"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.\n'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can\neasily guess what fairy brought it.\u2014Nobody could have written so\nprettily, but you, Emma.\"\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.\u2014After a little thinking, and a very\ntender sigh, he added,\n\"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\nremember nothing;\u2014not even that particular riddle which you have heard\nme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\nseveral.\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid,\nKindled a flame I yet deplore,\nThe hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,\nThough of his near approach afraid,\nSo fatal to my suit before.\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it\u2014but it is very clever all\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\"\n\"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.\"\n\"Aye, very true.\u2014I wish I could recollect more of it.\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid.\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her\u2014and what\nroom there will be for the children?\"\n\"Oh! yes\u2014she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\nhas;\u2014and there is the nursery for the children,\u2014just as usual, you\nknow. Why should there be any change?\"\n\"I do not know, my dear\u2014but it is so long since she was here!\u2014not since\nlast Easter, and then only for a few days.\u2014Mr. John Knightley's being a\nlawyer is very inconvenient.\u2014Poor Isabella!\u2014she is sadly taken away\nfrom us all!\u2014and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss\nTaylor here!\"\n\"She will not be surprized, papa, at least.\"\n\"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\nfirst heard she was going to be married.\"\n\"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\nhere.\"\n\"Yes, my dear, if there is time.\u2014But\u2014(in a very depressed tone)\u2014she is\ncoming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.\"\n\"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer\u2014but it seems a case of\nnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be\ntaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim\nthis Christmas\u2014though you know it is longer since they were with him,\nthan with us.\"\n\"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\nanywhere but at Hartfield.\"\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his\nbrother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat\nmusing a little while, and then said,\n\"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.\"\n\"Ah! papa\u2014that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do\nnot think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\nhusband.\"\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\nby the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she\nimmediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\n\"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my\nbrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the\nchildren. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder\nwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\"\n\"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\"\n\"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.\"",

Some people are surprized, I believe, that\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed.

If he were, every thing else must give\nway; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\ndining with him\u2014had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\nconditionally to come.",

      "text": "Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\nof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of\nMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,\nabout a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and\nnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\neyes.\u2014Emma's remark was\u2014\n\"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\ndays.\"\u2014Harriet's was\u2014\n\"Oh, what a sweet house!\u2014How very beautiful!\u2014There are the yellow\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\"\n\"I do not often walk this way _now_,\" said Emma, as they proceeded,\n\"but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of\nthis part of Highbury.\"\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and\nher curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and\nprobabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.\nElton's seeing ready wit in her.\n\"I wish we could contrive it,\" said she; \"but I cannot think of any\ntolerable pretence for going in;\u2014no servant that I want to inquire\nabout of his housekeeper\u2014no message from my father.\"\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of\nsome minutes, Harriet thus began again\u2014\n\"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!\"\u2014\nEmma laughed, and replied,\n\"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\nI must find other people charming\u2014one other person at least. And I am\nnot only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\nintention of ever marrying at all.\"\n\"Ah!\u2014so you say; but I cannot believe it.\"\n\"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather\nnot be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to\nmarry, I must expect to repent it.\"\n\"Dear me!\u2014it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\"\u2014\n\"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been\nin love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever\nshall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\nmistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never,\nnever could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always\nfirst and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.\"\n\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"\n\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly\u2014so satisfied\u2014so\nsmiling\u2014so prosing\u2014so undistinguishing and unfastidious\u2014and so apt to\ntell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.\"\n\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!\"\n\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable\nold maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of\ngood fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and\npleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much\nagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;\nfor a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour\nthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\nsmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\ncross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\ngood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\ncertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\nonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\nsixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.\"\n\"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\ngrow old?\"\n\"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\nto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be\nenough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation\nthat declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and\nevery fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a\nparent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and\nblinder. My nephews and nieces!\u2014I shall often have a niece with me.\"\n\"Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\na hundred times\u2014but are you acquainted?\"\n\"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter\nfrom her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go\nround and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of\na stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears\nof nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she\ntires me to death.\"\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\n\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\nevery thing else appear!\u2014I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?\"",

The room they\nwere taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards;\nbehind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door\nbetween them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to\nreceive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged\nto leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr.\nElton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained\najar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she\nhoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the\nadjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It\ncould be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and\nmake her appearance.\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of\nhaving schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to\nthe point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told\nHarriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;\nother little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing\nserious.\n\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch, and\nwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading\nthem forward to the great event.",

I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of\nthe change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and\nnow you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.\"\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse\u2014\"yes, certainly\u2014I cannot deny\nthat Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\noften\u2014but then\u2014she is always obliged to go away again.\"\n\"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.\u2014You quite\nforget poor Mr. Weston.\"\n\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston has\nsome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of\nthe poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the\nclaims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for\nIsabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of\nputting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"\n\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.\u2014\n\"Are you talking about me?\u2014I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\ngreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\nthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of\nMiss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to\nslighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is\nnothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very\nbest-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your\nbrother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his\nflying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last Easter\u2014and ever\nsince his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing\nthat note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that\nthere was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could\nnot be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.\u2014If any body\ncan deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.\"\n\"Where is the young man?\" said John Knightley. \"Has he been here on\nthis occasion\u2014or has he not?\"\n\"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma. \"There was a strong\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\nnothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\"\n\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father. \"He\nwrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps\u2014\"\n\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\"\n\"Three-and-twenty!\u2014is he indeed?\u2014Well, I could not have thought it\u2014and\nhe was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does\nfly indeed!\u2014and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding\ngood, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of\npleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\n28th\u2014and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it\nwas signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'\u2014I remember that perfectly.\"\n\"How very pleasing and proper of him!\" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\nKnightley. \"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\nhow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\nsomething so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents\nand natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part\nwith him. To give up one's child! I really never could think well of\nany body who proposed such a thing to any body else.\"\n\"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\" observed Mr.\nJohn Knightley coolly. \"But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have\nfelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is\nrather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;\nhe takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow\nor other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society\nfor his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and\nplaying whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family\naffection, or any thing that home affords.\"",

I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\nassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\nsent us off altogether, in such good case.

      "text": "\"What is the matter, sir?\u2014Did you speak to me?\" cried Mr. John\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\n\"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\nwell\u2014but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before\nyou left home.\"\n\"My dear Isabella,\"\u2014exclaimed he hastily\u2014\"pray do not concern yourself\nabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\nthe children, and let me look as I chuse.\"\n\"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\"\ncried Emma, \"about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\nnot the old prejudice be too strong?\"\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\nto give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\nworse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\nFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\nmoment very happy to assist in praising.\n\"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\" said Mrs. John Knightley.\u2014\"It is so\nlong since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\naccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\nregret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more at\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\ndelightful companion for Emma.\"\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\n\"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\nkind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\nbetter companion than Harriet.\"\n\"I am most happy to hear it\u2014but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\nvery accomplished and superior!\u2014and exactly Emma's age.\"\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\nmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\nclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\na great deal to be said\u2014much praise and many comments\u2014undoubting\ndecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe\nPhilippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\ntolerably;\u2014but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\nhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\nher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\nhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\ngruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\nit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\ndangerous opening.\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\nwith tender concern.\u2014The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, \"Ah!\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\ndoes not bear talking of.\" And for a little while she hoped he would\nnot talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore\nhim to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some\nminutes, however, he began with,\n\"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\ninstead of coming here.\"\n\"But why should you be sorry, sir?\u2014I assure you, it did the children a\ngreat deal of good.\"\n\"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\nto South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\nhear you had fixed upon South End.\"\n\"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\na mistake, sir.\u2014We all had our health perfectly well there, never found\nthe least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\nentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\nbe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air,\nand his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.\"\n\"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.\u2014Perry\nwas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\nsea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And,\nby what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\nthe sea\u2014a quarter of a mile off\u2014very comfortable. You should have\nconsulted Perry.\"\n\"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;\u2014only consider how\ngreat it would have been.\u2014An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\"\n\"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.\u2014Better not move at all,\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a\nworse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\nill-judged measure.\"\nEmma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had\nreached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\nbrother-in-law's breaking out.\n\"Mr. Perry,\" said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, \"would do\nas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\nany business of his, to wonder at what I do?\u2014at my taking my family to\none part of the coast or another?\u2014I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\nmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.\u2014I want his directions no more than\nhis drugs.\" He paused\u2014and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\nsarcastic dryness, \"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\nfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\nexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.\"",

This is quite\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body\ninvites their friends about them, and people think little of even the\nworst weather.

She had frequently\nthought\u2014especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor\u2014that if\nshe _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\ncharacter and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\nfamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a\nmatch that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not\nmeaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\nchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided\nintention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain\ndegree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in\ntheir friends' imaginations.\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\ncross\u2014and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\npass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\nsubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.\u2014So it proved;\u2014for\nwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at\ndinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\nhospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say\nto her,\n\"We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to\nsee two more here,\u2014your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my\nson\u2014and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not\nhear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting\nFrank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us\nwithin a fortnight.\"\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\nhis proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their\nparty quite complete.\n\"He has been wanting to come to us,\" continued Mr. Weston, \"ever since\nSeptember: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\nown time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\nourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\nBut now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\nJanuary.\"\n\"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\nyourself.\"\n\"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\nShe does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\nknow the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is\u2014(but this is\nquite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the\nother room. There are secrets in all families, you know)\u2014The case is,\nthat a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in\nJanuary; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If\nthey are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it\nis a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has\na particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite\nthem once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes\nto the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as\nconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of\nbeing here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the\nupper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so\nlittle used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their\neffects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.\"",

Even\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\nsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\nany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the\nChurchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are\njealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.\"\n\"He ought to come,\" said Emma. \"If he could stay only a couple of days,\nhe ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having\nit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall\ninto bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she\nwants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being under\nsuch restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if\nhe likes it.\"\n\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\none decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston. \"One ought to\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\nindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\nnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and\nevery thing gives way to her.\"\n\"But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.\nNow, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to\nwhom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\ntowards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom\nshe owes nothing at all.\"\n\"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\na bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\nI have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\nmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\nbe.\"\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied, unless\nhe comes.\"\n\"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,\" continued Mrs.\nWeston, \"and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\nbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance",

Without scruple\u2014without apology\u2014without much apparent\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\nreplied,\n\"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\nyourself\u2014you take me for my friend\u2014any message to Miss Smith I shall be\nhappy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\"\n\"Miss Smith!\u2014message to Miss Smith!\u2014What could she possibly mean!\"\u2014And\nhe repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\npretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\n\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\"\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\nall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,\u2014but\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,\u2014he\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\nfavourable answer.\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\nreplied,\n\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\nmonth, to Miss Smith\u2014such attentions as I have been in the daily habit\nof observing\u2014to be addressing me in this manner\u2014this is an unsteadiness\nof character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,\nsir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such\nprofessions.\"\n\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?\u2014Miss\nSmith!\u2014I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\nexistence\u2014never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has\nfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\nsorry\u2014extremely sorry\u2014But, Miss Smith, indeed!\u2014Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who\ncan think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot\nreally, seriously, doubt it. No!\u2014(in an accent meant to be\ninsinuating)\u2014I am sure you have seen and understood me.\"\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this\u2014which of\nall her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\noverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\nbeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he\ntried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed\u2014\n\"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\nsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.\"\n\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing. So far from having\nlong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\nshould have been giving way to any feelings\u2014Nothing could be farther\nfrom my wishes\u2014your attachment to my friend Harriet\u2014your pursuit of\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were\nnot your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you\njudged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you\nhave never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss\nSmith?\u2014that you have never thought seriously of her?\"\n\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn: \"never, I assure you.\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!\u2014Miss Smith is a very good sort of\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her\nextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\nto\u2014Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!\u2014No, madam, my\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement\nI received\u2014\"\n\"Encouragement!\u2014I give you encouragement!\u2014Sir, you have been entirely\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\ntrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at\npresent.\"\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\nsupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\ndeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,",

Who could have seen through such\nthick-headed nonsense?\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\nthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\nhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the\nconviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It was\ndreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\nconcerned about the feelings of others.\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she\nwas perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need\nbe cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language\nor manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she\ncould hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\nless allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him.\nHe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\nelse with twenty, or with ten.\nBut\u2014that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\nhim!\u2014should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!\u2014look down\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\npresumption in addressing her!\u2014It was most provoking.\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know\nthat the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family\u2014and that the\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\ninconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses\nhad long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood\nwhich Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as\nhe could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend\nhim to notice but his situation and his civility.\u2014But he had fancied\nher in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and\nadmit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\ndelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\nhers.\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought\nto be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\nconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\n\"Here have I,\" said she, \"actually talked poor Harriet into being very\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her\nnot to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\nof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel\nthis disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any\nbody else who would be at all desirable for her;\u2014William Coxe\u2014Oh! no, I\ncould not endure William Coxe\u2014a pert young lawyer.\"\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a\nmore serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might\nbe, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to\nHarriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the\nawkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or\ndiscontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing\nresentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most\nunmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last\nwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most\ndreadfully.",

The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\nand of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough\nto keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\nsoftened pain and brighter hope.\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\nto bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\ndepend on getting tolerably out of it.\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love\nwith her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\ndisappoint him\u2014that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior\nsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive\u2014and that there\ncould be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the\nthree principals, and especially for her father's being given a\nmoment's uneasiness about it.\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of\nsnow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome\nthat might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.\nThe weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\ncould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\ndaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\nor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\nwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\nthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\nmorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\nfreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No\nintercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on\nSunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for\nMr. Elton's absenting himself.\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and\nthough she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some\nsociety or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well\nsatisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir\nout; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep\nentirely from them,\u2014\n\"Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\"\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his\ncompanions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\nill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during\nthe rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and\nobliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.

      "text": "She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite\nas much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\nmore,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\nproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\nsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\nlooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\nsight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\nChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\nwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\ntaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\nuse of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.\n\"The Churchills are very likely in fault,\" said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\n\"but I dare say he might come if he would.\"\n\"I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come;\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him.\"\n\"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\npoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.\"\n\"How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature?\"\n\"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very\nlittle for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who\nhave always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural\nthan one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are\nproud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish\ntoo. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have\ncontrived it between September and January. A man at his age\u2014what is\nhe?\u2014three or four-and-twenty\u2014cannot be without the means of doing as\nmuch as that. It is impossible.\"\n\"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\nown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\nto manage.\"\n\"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\nmoney\u2014he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts\nin the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or\nother. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can\nleave the Churchills.\"\n\"Yes, sometimes he can.\"\n\"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.\"\n\"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\nfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\nChurchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can\nat others.\"\n\"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill\u2014'Every sacrifice of mere\npleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but\nI must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my\nfailing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I\nshall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'\u2014If he would say so to her at\nonce, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\nopposition made to his going.\"\n\"No,\" said Emma, laughing; \"but perhaps there might be some made to his\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\nuse!\u2014Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite\nto your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\nhim!\u2014Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\nloud as he could!\u2014How can you imagine such conduct practicable?\"\n\"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\nHe would feel himself in the right; and the declaration\u2014made, of\ncourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner\u2014would do\nhim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the\npeople he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients\ncan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that\nthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his\nfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as\nwell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his\nfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their\nhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.\nRespect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in\nthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their\nlittle minds would bend to his.\"\n\"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they\nhave a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as\ngreat ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were\nto be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's\nsituation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been\nrecommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The\nChurchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would\nhave no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.\nTo him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\nperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and\nregard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,\nas you can have, without being so equal, under particular\ncircumstances, to act up to it.\"\n\"Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.\"\n\"Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\nopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\nlife.\"\n\"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\nwill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\nfollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\nthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\nought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\ntheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\nside to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\nwould have been no difficulty now.\"\n\"We shall never agree about him,\" cried Emma; \"but that is nothing\nextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\nthough in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\ncomplying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's\nperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\nadvantages, it will secure him many others.\"\n\"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of\nleading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\nexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\nflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\nhimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\npreserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right\nto complain. His letters disgust me.\"\n\"Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.\"\n\"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a\nwoman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's\nplace, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her\naccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\nfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\nwould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he\ndid or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\nconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\nherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in\nFrench, not in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good\nmanners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy\ntowards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about\nhim.\"\n\"You seem determined to think ill of him.\"\n\"Me!\u2014not at all,\" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \"I do not\nwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his\nmerits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely\npersonal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\nplausible manners.\"\n\"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\nat Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\nagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\nbargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\ncoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\nparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest\u2014one object of\ncuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\nof nobody else.\"\n\"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\"\n\"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\nand so on to every body, having that general information on all\nsubjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead,\njust as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each;\nthat is my idea of him.\"\n\"And mine,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"is, that if he turn out any\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company\u2014the great man\u2014the\npractised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make\nevery body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\nbe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\nfools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could\nnot endure such a puppy when it came to the point.\"\n\"I will say no more about him,\" cried Emma, \"you turn every thing to\nevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.\"",
