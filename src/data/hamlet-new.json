A figure like your father,\nArmed at point exactly, cap-\u00e0-pie,\nAppears before them, and with solemn march\nGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd\nBy their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,\nWithin his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd\nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,\nStand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch,\nWhere, as they had deliver'd, both in time,\nForm of the thing, each word made true and good,\nThe apparition comes. I knew your father;\nThese hands are not more like.\nHAMLET.\nBut where was this?\nMARCELLUS.\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch.\nHAMLET.\nDid you not speak to it?\nHORATIO.\nMy lord, I did;\nBut answer made it none: yet once methought\nIt lifted up it head, and did address\nItself to motion, like as it would speak.\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\nAnd vanish'd from our sight.\nHAMLET.\n'Tis very strange.\nHORATIO.\nAs I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\nTo let you know of it.\nHAMLET.\nIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\nHold you the watch tonight?\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\nWe do, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nArm'd, say you?\nBoth.\nArm'd, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nFrom top to toe?\nBOTH.\nMy lord, from head to foot.\nHAMLET.\nThen saw you not his face?\nHORATIO.\nO yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.\nHAMLET.\nWhat, look'd he frowningly?\nHORATIO.\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\nHAMLET.\nPale, or red?\nHORATIO.\nNay, very pale.\nHAMLET.\nAnd fix'd his eyes upon you?\nHORATIO.\nMost constantly.\nHAMLET.\nI would I had been there.\nHORATIO.\nIt would have much amaz'd you.\nHAMLET.\nVery like, very like. Stay'd it long?\nHORATIO.\nWhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\nLonger, longer.\nHORATIO.\nNot when I saw't.\nHAMLET.\nHis beard was grizzled, no?\nHORATIO.\nIt was, as I have seen it in his life,\nA sable silver'd.\nHAMLET.\nI will watch tonight;\nPerchance 'twill walk again.\nHORATIO.\nI warrant you it will.\nHAMLET.\nIf it assume my noble father's person,\nI'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\nIf you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,\nLet it be tenable in your silence still;\nAnd whatsoever else shall hap tonight,\nGive it an understanding, but no tongue.\nI will requite your loves. So, fare ye well.\nUpon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve,\nI'll visit you.\nALL.\nOur duty to your honour.\nHAMLET.\nYour loves, as mine to you: farewell.\n[_Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo._]\nMy father's spirit in arms! All is not well;\nI doubt some foul play: would the night were come!\nTill then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,\nThough all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.",

Farewell.\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\nAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,\nBut let me hear from you.\nOPHELIA.\nDo you doubt that?\nLAERTES.\nFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,\nHold it a fashion and a toy in blood;\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute;\nNo more.\nOPHELIA.\nNo more but so?\nLAERTES.\nThink it no more.\nFor nature crescent does not grow alone\nIn thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\nThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,\nHis greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;\nFor he himself is subject to his birth:\nHe may not, as unvalu'd persons do,\nCarve for himself; for on his choice depends\nThe sanctity and health of this whole state;\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\nWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\nAs he in his particular act and place\nMay give his saying deed; which is no further\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\nThen weigh what loss your honour may sustain\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\nTo his unmaster'd importunity.\nFear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.\nVirtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\nToo oft before their buttons be disclos'd,\nAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\nBe wary then, best safety lies in fear.\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\nOPHELIA.\nI shall th'effect of this good lesson keep\nAs watchman to my heart. But good my brother,\nDo not as some ungracious pastors do,\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven;\nWhilst like a puff'd and reckless libertine\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads,\nAnd recks not his own rede.\nLAERTES.\nO, fear me not.\nI stay too long. But here my father comes.\nEnter Polonius.\nA double blessing is a double grace;\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\nPOLONIUS.\nYet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame.\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\nAnd you are stay'd for. There, my blessing with you.\n[_Laying his hand on Laertes's head._]\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\nLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\nNor any unproportion'd thought his act.\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\nGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\nOf each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware\nOf entrance to a quarrel; but being in,\nBear't that th'opposed may beware of thee.\nGive every man thine ear, but few thy voice:\nTake each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement.\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\nBut not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man;\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be:\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend;\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\nThis above all: to thine own self be true;\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\nFarewell: my blessing season this in thee.\nLAERTES.\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\nPOLONIUS.\nThe time invites you; go, your servants tend.\nLAERTES.\nFarewell, Ophelia, and remember well\nWhat I have said to you.\nOPHELIA.\n'Tis in my memory lock'd,\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\nLAERTES.\nFarewell.\n[_Exit._]\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\nOPHELIA.\nSo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.\nPOLONIUS.\nMarry, well bethought:\n'Tis told me he hath very oft of late\nGiven private time to you; and you yourself\nHave of your audience been most free and bounteous.\nIf it be so,\u2014as so 'tis put on me,\nAnd that in way of caution,\u2014I must tell you\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\nAs it behoves my daughter and your honour.\nWhat is between you? Give me up the truth.\nOPHELIA.\nHe hath, my lord, of late made many tenders\nOf his affection to me.\nPOLONIUS.\nAffection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl,\nUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.\nDo you believe his tenders, as you call them?\nOPHELIA.\nI do not know, my lord, what I should think.\nPOLONIUS.\nMarry, I'll teach you; think yourself a baby;\nThat you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,\nWhich are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;\nOr,\u2014not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\nRunning it thus,\u2014you'll tender me a fool.\nOPHELIA.\nMy lord, he hath importun'd me with love\nIn honourable fashion.\nPOLONIUS.\nAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\nOPHELIA.\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\nPOLONIUS.\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\nLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,\nGiving more light than heat, extinct in both,\nEven in their promise, as it is a-making,\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence;\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\nThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\nBelieve so much in him that he is young;\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\nThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,\nDo not believe his vows; for they are brokers,\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\nThe better to beguile. This is for all:\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\nLook to't, I charge you; come your ways.\nOPHELIA.\nI shall obey, my lord.\n[_Exeunt._]",

Now, Hamlet, hear.\n'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\nA serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark\nIs by a forged process of my death\nRankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,\nThe serpent that did sting thy father's life\nNow wears his crown.\nHAMLET.\nO my prophetic soul!\nMine uncle!\nGHOST.\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\nWith witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,\u2014\nO wicked wit, and gifts, that have the power\nSo to seduce!\u2014won to his shameful lust\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.\nO Hamlet, what a falling off was there,\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\nI made to her in marriage; and to decline\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\nTo those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;\nSo lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed\nAnd prey on garbage.\nBut soft! methinks I scent the morning air;\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole\nWith juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\nThe leperous distilment, whose effect\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body;\nAnd with a sudden vigour it doth posset\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\nThe thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;\nAnd a most instant tetter bark'd about,\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\nAll my smooth body.\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,\nOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatch'd:\nCut off even in the blossoms of my sin,\nUnhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;\nNo reckoning made, but sent to my account\nWith all my imperfections on my head.\nO horrible! O horrible! most horrible!\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\nBut howsoever thou pursu'st this act,\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\nAgainst thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!\nThe glow-worm shows the matin to be near,\nAnd 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.\nAdieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.\n[_Exit._]\nHAMLET.\nO all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?\nAnd shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart;\nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\nBut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?\nAy, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat\nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee?\nYea, from the table of my memory\nI'll wipe away all trivial fond records,\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\nThat youth and observation copied there;\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\nUnmix'd with baser matter.

Come, bird, come.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\nMARCELLUS.\nHow is't, my noble lord?\nHORATIO.\nWhat news, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nO, wonderful!\nHORATIO.\nGood my lord, tell it.\nHAMLET.\nNo, you'll reveal it.\nHORATIO.\nNot I, my lord, by heaven.\nMARCELLUS.\nNor I, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nHow say you then, would heart of man once think it?\u2014\nBut you'll be secret?\nHORATIO and MARCELLUS.\nAy, by heaven, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nThere's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark\nBut he's an arrant knave.\nHORATIO.\nThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\nTo tell us this.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, right; you are i' the right;\nAnd so, without more circumstance at all,\nI hold it fit that we shake hands and part:\nYou, as your business and desire shall point you,\u2014\nFor every man hath business and desire,\nSuch as it is;\u2014and for my own poor part,\nLook you, I'll go pray.\nHORATIO.\nThese are but wild and whirling words, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI'm sorry they offend you, heartily;\nYes faith, heartily.\nHORATIO.\nThere's no offence, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nYes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,\nAnd much offence too. Touching this vision here,\nIt is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.\nFor your desire to know what is between us,\nO'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,\nAs you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,\nGive me one poor request.\nHORATIO.\nWhat is't, my lord? We will.\nHAMLET.\nNever make known what you have seen tonight.\nHORATIO and MARCELLUS.\nMy lord, we will not.\nHAMLET.\nNay, but swear't.\nHORATIO.\nIn faith, my lord, not I.\nMARCELLUS.\nNor I, my lord, in faith.\nHAMLET.\nUpon my sword.\nMARCELLUS.\nWe have sworn, my lord, already.\nHAMLET.\nIndeed, upon my sword, indeed.\nGHOST.\n[_Cries under the stage._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\nHa, ha boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?\nCome on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.\nConsent to swear.\nHORATIO.\nPropose the oath, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nNever to speak of this that you have seen.\nSwear by my sword.\nGHOST.\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\n_Hic et ubique?_ Then we'll shift our ground.\nCome hither, gentlemen,\nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword.\nNever to speak of this that you have heard.\nSwear by my sword.\nGHOST.\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\nWell said, old mole! Canst work i' th'earth so fast?\nA worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.\nHORATIO.\nO day and night, but this is wondrous strange.\nHAMLET.\nAnd therefore as a stranger give it welcome.\nThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come,\nHere, as before, never, so help you mercy,\nHow strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,\u2014\nAs I perchance hereafter shall think meet\nTo put an antic disposition on\u2014\nThat you, at such times seeing me, never shall,\nWith arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,\nOr by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,\nAs 'Well, we know', or 'We could and if we would',\nOr 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be and if they might',\nOr such ambiguous giving out, to note\nThat you know aught of me:\u2014this not to do.\nSo grace and mercy at your most need help you,\nSwear.\nGHOST.\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\nRest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen,\nWith all my love I do commend me to you;\nAnd what so poor a man as Hamlet is\nMay do t'express his love and friending to you,\nGod willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,\nAnd still your fingers on your lips, I pray.\nThe time is out of joint. O cursed spite,\nThat ever I was born to set it right.\nNay, come, let's go together.\n[_Exeunt._]",

Long stay'd he so,\nAt last,\u2014a little shaking of mine arm,\nAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,\nHe rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound\nAs it did seem to shatter all his bulk\nAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,\nAnd with his head over his shoulder turn'd\nHe seem'd to find his way without his eyes,\nFor out o' doors he went without their help,\nAnd to the last bended their light on me.\nPOLONIUS.\nCome, go with me. I will go seek the King.\nThis is the very ecstasy of love,\nWhose violent property fordoes itself,\nAnd leads the will to desperate undertakings,\nAs oft as any passion under heaven\nThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry,\u2014\nWhat, have you given him any hard words of late?\nOPHELIA.\nNo, my good lord; but as you did command,\nI did repel his letters and denied\nHis access to me.\nPOLONIUS.\nThat hath made him mad.\nI am sorry that with better heed and judgement\nI had not quoted him.

And all for nothing!\nFor Hecuba?\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech;\nMake mad the guilty, and appal the free,\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\nAnd can say nothing. No, not for a king\nUpon whose property and most dear life\nA damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?\nWho calls me villain, breaks my pate across?\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\nTweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i' th' throat\nAs deep as to the lungs?

Fie upon't! Foh!\nAbout, my brain! I have heard\nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play,\nHave by the very cunning of the scene,\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\nThey have proclaim'd their malefactions.\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\nWith most miraculous organ. I'll have these players\nPlay something like the murder of my father\nBefore mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;\nI'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\nMay be the devil, and the devil hath power\nT'assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\nAbuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds\nMore relative than this. The play's the thing\nWherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.",

This play is the image of a\nmurder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Duke's name, his wife Baptista:\nyou shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o' that?\nYour majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not.

Pox, leave thy damnable\nfaces, and begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.\nLUCIANUS.\nThoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing,\nConfederate season, else no creature seeing;\nThou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,\nWith Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,\nThy natural magic and dire property\nOn wholesome life usurp immediately.\n[_Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears._]\nHAMLET.\nHe poisons him i' th'garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago. The story\nis extant, and written in very choice Italian. You shall see anon how\nthe murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.\nOPHELIA.\nThe King rises.\nHAMLET.\nWhat, frighted with false fire?\nQUEEN.\nHow fares my lord?\nPOLONIUS.\nGive o'er the play.\nKING.\nGive me some light.

O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.\nHe took my father grossly, full of bread,\nWith all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;\nAnd how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?\nBut in our circumstance and course of thought,\n'Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng'd,\nTo take him in the purging of his soul,\nWhen he is fit and season'd for his passage? No.\nUp, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:\nWhen he is drunk asleep; or in his rage,\nOr in th'incestuous pleasure of his bed,\nAt gaming, swearing; or about some act\nThat has no relish of salvation in't,\nThen trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,\nAnd that his soul may be as damn'd and black\nAs hell, whereto it goes.

You are my mother.\nQUEEN.\nNay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.\nHAMLET.\nCome, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.\nYou go not till I set you up a glass\nWhere you may see the inmost part of you.\nQUEEN.\nWhat wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?\nHelp, help, ho!\nPOLONIUS.\n[_Behind._] What, ho! help, help, help!\nHAMLET.\nHow now? A rat? [_Draws._]\nDead for a ducat, dead!\n[_Makes a pass through the arras._]\nPOLONIUS.\n[_Behind._] O, I am slain!\n[_Falls and dies._]\nQUEEN.\nO me, what hast thou done?\nHAMLET.\nNay, I know not. Is it the King?\n[_Draws forth Polonius._]\nQUEEN.\nO what a rash and bloody deed is this!\nHAMLET.\nA bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother,\nAs kill a king and marry with his brother.\nQUEEN.\nAs kill a king?\nHAMLET.\nAy, lady, 'twas my word.\u2014\n[_To Polonius._] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!\nI took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,\nThou find'st to be too busy is some danger.\u2014\nLeave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,\nAnd let me wring your heart, for so I shall,\nIf it be made of penetrable stuff;\nIf damned custom have not braz'd it so,\nThat it is proof and bulwark against sense.\nQUEEN.\nWhat have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue\nIn noise so rude against me?\nHAMLET.\nSuch an act\nThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,\nCalls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love,\nAnd sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows\nAs false as dicers' oaths. O such a deed\nAs from the body of contraction plucks\nThe very soul, and sweet religion makes\nA rhapsody of words. Heaven's face doth glow,\nYea this solidity and compound mass,\nWith tristful visage, as against the doom,\nIs thought-sick at the act.\nQUEEN.\nAy me, what act,\nThat roars so loud, and thunders in the index?\nHAMLET.\nLook here upon this picture, and on this,\nThe counterfeit presentment of two brothers.\nSee what a grace was seated on this brow,\nHyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself,\nAn eye like Mars, to threaten and command,\nA station like the herald Mercury\nNew lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:\nA combination and a form indeed,\nWhere every god did seem to set his seal,\nTo give the world assurance of a man.\nThis was your husband. Look you now what follows.\nHere is your husband, like a mildew'd ear\nBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?\nCould you on this fair mountain leave to feed,\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?\nYou cannot call it love; for at your age\nThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,\nAnd waits upon the judgement: and what judgement\nWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,\nElse could you not have motion; but sure that sense\nIs apoplex'd, for madness would not err\nNor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd\nBut it reserv'd some quantity of choice\nTo serve in such a difference. What devil was't\nThat thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?\nEyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\nEars without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\nOr but a sickly part of one true sense\nCould not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?\nRebellious hell,\nIf thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,\nTo flaming youth let virtue be as wax,\nAnd melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame\nWhen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,\nSince frost itself as actively doth burn,\nAnd reason panders will.\nQUEEN.\nO Hamlet, speak no more.\nThou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,\nAnd there I see such black and grained spots\nAs will not leave their tinct.\nHAMLET.\nNay, but to live\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\nStew'd in corruption, honeying and making love\nOver the nasty sty.\nQUEEN.\nO speak to me no more;\nThese words like daggers enter in mine ears;\nNo more, sweet Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nA murderer and a villain;\nA slave that is not twentieth part the tithe\nOf your precedent lord. A vice of kings,\nA cutpurse of the empire and the rule,\nThat from a shelf the precious diadem stole\nAnd put it in his pocket!\nQUEEN.\nNo more.\nHAMLET.\nA king of shreds and patches!\u2014\nEnter Ghost.\nSave me and hover o'er me with your wings,\nYou heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?\nQUEEN.\nAlas, he's mad.\nHAMLET.\nDo you not come your tardy son to chide,\nThat, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by\nThe important acting of your dread command?\nO say!\nGHOST.\nDo not forget. This visitation\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\nBut look, amazement on thy mother sits.\nO step between her and her fighting soul.\nConceit in weakest bodies strongest works.\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nHow is it with you, lady?\nQUEEN.\nAlas, how is't with you,\nThat you do bend your eye on vacancy,\nAnd with the incorporal air do hold discourse?\nForth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,\nYour bedded hairs, like life in excrements,\nStart up and stand an end. O gentle son,\nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper\nSprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?\nHAMLET.\nOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,\nHis form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,\nWould make them capable.\u2014Do not look upon me,\nLest with this piteous action you convert\nMy stern effects. Then what I have to do\nWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.\nQUEEN.\nTo whom do you speak this?\nHAMLET.\nDo you see nothing there?\nQUEEN.\nNothing at all; yet all that is I see.\nHAMLET.\nNor did you nothing hear?\nQUEEN.\nNo, nothing but ourselves.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, look you there! look how it steals away!\nMy father, in his habit as he liv'd!\nLook where he goes even now out at the portal.\n[_Exit Ghost._]\nQUEEN.\nThis is the very coinage of your brain.\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\nIs very cunning in.\nHAMLET.\nEcstasy!\nMy pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,\nAnd makes as healthful music. It is not madness\nThat I have utter'd. Bring me to the test,\nAnd I the matter will re-word; which madness\nWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,\nLay not that flattering unction to your soul\nThat not your trespass, but my madness speaks.\nIt will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\nWhilst rank corruption, mining all within,\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,\nRepent what's past, avoid what is to come;\nAnd do not spread the compost on the weeds,\nTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;\nFor in the fatness of these pursy times\nVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,\nYea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\nQUEEN.\nO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.\nHAMLET.\nO throw away the worser part of it,\nAnd live the purer with the other half.\nGood night. But go not to mine uncle's bed.\nAssume a virtue, if you have it not.\nThat monster custom, who all sense doth eat,\nOf habits evil, is angel yet in this,\nThat to the use of actions fair and good\nHe likewise gives a frock or livery\nThat aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,\nAnd that shall lend a kind of easiness\nTo the next abstinence. The next more easy;\nFor use almost can change the stamp of nature,\nAnd either curb the devil, or throw him out\nWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night,\nAnd when you are desirous to be bles'd,\nI'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord\n[_Pointing to Polonius._]\nI do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,\nTo punish me with this, and this with me,\nThat I must be their scourge and minister.\nI will bestow him, and will answer well\nThe death I gave him. So again, good night.\nI must be cruel, only to be kind:\nThus bad begins, and worse remains behind.\nOne word more, good lady.\nQUEEN.\nWhat shall I do?\nHAMLET.\nNot this, by no means, that I bid you do:\nLet the bloat King tempt you again to bed,\nPinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,\nAnd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,\nOr paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,\nMake you to ravel all this matter out,\nThat I essentially am not in madness,\nBut mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,\nFor who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\nWould from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\nSuch dear concernings hide? Who would do so?\nNo, in despite of sense and secrecy,\nUnpeg the basket on the house's top,\nLet the birds fly, and like the famous ape,\nTo try conclusions, in the basket creep\nAnd break your own neck down.\nQUEEN.\nBe thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,\nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe\nWhat thou hast said to me.\nHAMLET.\nI must to England, you know that?\nQUEEN.\nAlack,\nI had forgot. 'Tis so concluded on.\nHAMLET.\nThere's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,\nWhom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,\u2014\nThey bear the mandate, they must sweep my way\nAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work;\nFor 'tis the sport to have the enginer\nHoist with his own petard, and 't shall go hard\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\nAnd blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet,\nWhen in one line two crafts directly meet.\nThis man shall set me packing.\nI'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.\nMother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor\nIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,\nWho was in life a foolish prating knave.\nCome, sir, to draw toward an end with you.\nGood night, mother.\n[_Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius._]",

Your worm is your only emperor for diet.\nWe fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots.\nYour fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service,\u2014two dishes,\nbut to one table. That's the end.\nKING.\nAlas, alas!\nHAMLET.\nA man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the\nfish that hath fed of that worm.\nKING.\nWhat dost thou mean by this?\nHAMLET.\nNothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts\nof a beggar.\nKING.\nWhere is Polonius?\nHAMLET.\nIn heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there,\nseek him i' th'other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not\nwithin this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the\nlobby.\nKING.\n[_To some Attendants._] Go seek him there.\nHAMLET.\nHe will stay till you come.\n[_Exeunt Attendants._]\nKING.\nHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,\u2014\nWhich we do tender, as we dearly grieve\nFor that which thou hast done,\u2014must send thee hence\nWith fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself;\nThe bark is ready, and the wind at help,\nTh'associates tend, and everything is bent\nFor England.\nHAMLET.\nFor England?\nKING.\nAy, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nGood.\nKING.\nSo is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.\nHAMLET.\nI see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear\nmother.\nKING.\nThy loving father, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nMy mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one\nflesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England.\n[_Exit._]\nKING.\nFollow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard;\nDelay it not; I'll have him hence tonight.\nAway, for everything is seal'd and done\nThat else leans on th'affair. Pray you make haste.\n[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]\nAnd England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,\u2014\nAs my great power thereof may give thee sense,\nSince yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red\nAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awe\nPays homage to us,\u2014thou mayst not coldly set\nOur sovereign process, which imports at full,\nBy letters conjuring to that effect,\nThe present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;\nFor like the hectic in my blood he rages,\nAnd thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,\nHowe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.\n[_Exit._]\nSCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.\nEnter Fortinbras and Forces marching.\nFORTINBRAS.\nGo, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.\nTell him that by his license, Fortinbras\nCraves the conveyance of a promis'd march\nOver his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.\nIf that his Majesty would aught with us,\nWe shall express our duty in his eye;\nAnd let him know so.\nCAPTAIN.\nI will do't, my lord.\nFORTINBRAS.\nGo softly on.\n[_Exeunt all but the Captain._]\nEnter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern &c.\nHAMLET.\nGood sir, whose powers are these?\nCAPTAIN.\nThey are of Norway, sir.\nHAMLET.\nHow purpos'd, sir, I pray you?\nCAPTAIN.\nAgainst some part of Poland.\nHAMLET.\nWho commands them, sir?\nCAPTAIN.\nThe nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.\nHAMLET.\nGoes it against the main of Poland, sir,\nOr for some frontier?\nCAPTAIN.\nTruly to speak, and with no addition,\nWe go to gain a little patch of ground\nThat hath in it no profit but the name.\nTo pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;\nNor will it yield to Norway or the Pole\nA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, then the Polack never will defend it.\nCAPTAIN.\nYes, it is already garrison'd.\nHAMLET.\nTwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats\nWill not debate the question of this straw!\nThis is th'imposthume of much wealth and peace,\nThat inward breaks, and shows no cause without\nWhy the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.\nCAPTAIN.\nGod b' wi' you, sir.\n[_Exit._]\nROSENCRANTZ.\nWill't please you go, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nI'll be with you straight. Go a little before.\n[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]\nHow all occasions do inform against me,\nAnd spur my dull revenge. What is a man\nIf his chief good and market of his time\nBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.\nSure he that made us with such large discourse,\nLooking before and after, gave us not\nThat capability and godlike reason\nTo fust in us unus'd. Now whether it be\nBestial oblivion, or some craven scruple\nOf thinking too precisely on th'event,\u2014\nA thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom\nAnd ever three parts coward,\u2014I do not know\nWhy yet I live to say this thing's to do,\nSith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means\nTo do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me,\nWitness this army of such mass and charge,\nLed by a delicate and tender prince,\nWhose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,\nMakes mouths at the invisible event,\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\nEven for an eggshell. Rightly to be great\nIs not to stir without great argument,\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\nWhen honour's at the stake. How stand I then,\nThat have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\nAnd let all sleep, while to my shame I see\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men\nThat, for a fantasy and trick of fame,\nGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plot\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\nTo hide the slain? O, from this time forth,\nMy thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.\n[_Exit._]\nSCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the Castle.\nEnter Queen, Horatio and a Gentleman.\nQUEEN.\nI will not speak with her.\nGENTLEMAN.\nShe is importunate, indeed distract.\nHer mood will needs be pitied.\nQUEEN.\nWhat would she have?\nGENTLEMAN.\nShe speaks much of her father; says she hears\nThere's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,\nSpurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt,\nThat carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,\nYet the unshaped use of it doth move\nThe hearers to collection; they aim at it,\nAnd botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,\nWhich, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,\nIndeed would make one think there might be thought,\nThough nothing sure, yet much unhappily.\n'Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew\nDangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.\nQUEEN.\nLet her come in.\n[_Exit Gentleman._]\nTo my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,\nEach toy seems prologue to some great amiss.\nSo full of artless jealousy is guilt,\nIt spills itself in fearing to be spilt.\nEnter Ophelia.\nOPHELIA.\nWhere is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?\nQUEEN.\nHow now, Ophelia?\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nHow should I your true love know\nFrom another one?\nBy his cockle hat and staff\nAnd his sandal shoon.\nQUEEN.\nAlas, sweet lady, what imports this song?\nOPHELIA.\nSay you? Nay, pray you mark.\n[_Sings._]\nHe is dead and gone, lady,\nHe is dead and gone,\nAt his head a grass green turf,\nAt his heels a stone.\nQUEEN.\nNay, but Ophelia\u2014\nOPHELIA.\nPray you mark.\n[_Sings._]\nWhite his shroud as the mountain snow.\nEnter King.\nQUEEN.\nAlas, look here, my lord!\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nLarded all with sweet flowers;\nWhich bewept to the grave did not go\nWith true-love showers.\nKING.\nHow do you, pretty lady?\nOPHELIA.\nWell, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we\nknow what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!\nKING.\nConceit upon her father.\nOPHELIA.\nPray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it\nmeans, say you this:\n[_Sings._]\nTomorrow is Saint Valentine's day,\nAll in the morning betime,\nAnd I a maid at your window,\nTo be your Valentine.\nThen up he rose and donn'd his clothes,\nAnd dupp'd the chamber door,\nLet in the maid, that out a maid\nNever departed more.\nKING.\nPretty Ophelia!\nOPHELIA.\nIndeed la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't.\n[_Sings._]\nBy Gis and by Saint Charity,\nAlack, and fie for shame!\nYoung men will do't if they come to't;\nBy Cock, they are to blame.\nQuoth she, before you tumbled me,\nYou promis'd me to wed.\nSo would I ha' done, by yonder sun,\nAn thou hadst not come to my bed.\nKING.\nHow long hath she been thus?\nOPHELIA.\nI hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot choose but\nweep, to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground. My brother shall\nknow of it. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach!\nGood night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.\n[_Exit._]\nKING.\nFollow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.\n[_Exit Horatio._]\nO, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs\nAll from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,\nWhen sorrows come, they come not single spies,\nBut in battalions. First, her father slain;\nNext, your son gone; and he most violent author\nOf his own just remove; the people muddied,\nThick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers\nFor good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly\nIn hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia\nDivided from herself and her fair judgement,\nWithout the which we are pictures or mere beasts.\nLast, and as much containing as all these,\nHer brother is in secret come from France,\nFeeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,\nAnd wants not buzzers to infect his ear\nWith pestilent speeches of his father's death,\nWherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,\nWill nothing stick our person to arraign\nIn ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,\nLike to a murdering piece, in many places\nGives me superfluous death.\n[_A noise within._]\nQUEEN.\nAlack, what noise is this?\nKING.\nWhere are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.\nEnter a Gentleman.\nWhat is the matter?\nGENTLEMAN.\nSave yourself, my lord.\nThe ocean, overpeering of his list,\nEats not the flats with more impetuous haste\nThan young Laertes, in a riotous head,\nO'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord,\nAnd, as the world were now but to begin,\nAntiquity forgot, custom not known,\nThe ratifiers and props of every word,\nThey cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'\nCaps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,\n'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.'\nQUEEN.\nHow cheerfully on the false trail they cry.\nO, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.\n[_A noise within._]\nKING.\nThe doors are broke.\nEnter Laertes, armed; Danes following.\nLAERTES.\nWhere is this king?\u2014Sirs, stand you all without.\nDanes.\nNo, let's come in.\nLAERTES.\nI pray you, give me leave.\nDANES.\nWe will, we will.\n[_They retire without the door._]\nLAERTES.\nI thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king,\nGive me my father.\nQUEEN.\nCalmly, good Laertes.\nLAERTES.\nThat drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;\nCries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot\nEven here between the chaste unsmirched brow\nOf my true mother.\nKING.\nWhat is the cause, Laertes,\nThat thy rebellion looks so giant-like?\u2014\nLet him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.\nThere's such divinity doth hedge a king,\nThat treason can but peep to what it would,\nActs little of his will.\u2014Tell me, Laertes,\nWhy thou art thus incens'd.\u2014Let him go, Gertrude:\u2014\nSpeak, man.\nLAERTES.\nWhere is my father?\nKING.\nDead.\nQUEEN.\nBut not by him.\nKING.\nLet him demand his fill.\nLAERTES.\nHow came he dead? I'll not be juggled with.\nTo hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!\nConscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!\nI dare damnation. To this point I stand,\nThat both the worlds, I give to negligence,\nLet come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd\nMost throughly for my father.\nKING.\nWho shall stay you?\nLAERTES.\nMy will, not all the world.\nAnd for my means, I'll husband them so well,\nThey shall go far with little.\nKING.\nGood Laertes,\nIf you desire to know the certainty\nOf your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge\nThat, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,\nWinner and loser?\nLAERTES.\nNone but his enemies.\nKING.\nWill you know them then?\nLAERTES.\nTo his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;\nAnd, like the kind life-rendering pelican,\nRepast them with my blood.\nKING.\nWhy, now you speak\nLike a good child and a true gentleman.\nThat I am guiltless of your father's death,\nAnd am most sensibly in grief for it,\nIt shall as level to your judgement 'pear\nAs day does to your eye.\nDANES.\n[_Within._] Let her come in.\nLAERTES.\nHow now! What noise is that?\nRe-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.\nO heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt,\nBurn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.\nBy heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,\nTill our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!\nDear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!\nO heavens, is't possible a young maid's wits\nShould be as mortal as an old man's life?\nNature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,\nIt sends some precious instance of itself\nAfter the thing it loves.\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nThey bore him barefac'd on the bier,\nHey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny\nAnd on his grave rain'd many a tear.\u2014\nFare you well, my dove!\nLAERTES.\nHadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,\nIt could not move thus.\nOPHELIA.\nYou must sing 'Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O, how the\nwheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master's\ndaughter.\nLAERTES.\nThis nothing's more than matter.\nOPHELIA.\nThere's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray love, remember. And\nthere is pansies, that's for thoughts.\nLAERTES.\nA document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.\nOPHELIA.\nThere's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you; and here's\nsome for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays. O you must wear\nyour rue with a difference. There's a daisy. I would give you some\nviolets, but they wither'd all when my father died. They say he made a\ngood end.\n[_Sings._]\nFor bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.\nLAERTES.\nThought and affliction, passion, hell itself\nShe turns to favour and to prettiness.\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nAnd will he not come again?\nAnd will he not come again?\nNo, no, he is dead,\nGo to thy death-bed,\nHe never will come again.\nHis beard was as white as snow,\nAll flaxen was his poll.\nHe is gone, he is gone,\nAnd we cast away moan.\nGod ha' mercy on his soul.\nAnd of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' ye.\n[_Exit._]\nLAERTES.\nDo you see this, O God?\nKING.\nLaertes, I must commune with your grief,\nOr you deny me right. Go but apart,\nMake choice of whom your wisest friends you will,\nAnd they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.\nIf by direct or by collateral hand\nThey find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,\nOur crown, our life, and all that we call ours\nTo you in satisfaction; but if not,\nBe you content to lend your patience to us,\nAnd we shall jointly labour with your soul\nTo give it due content.\nLAERTES.\nLet this be so;\nHis means of death, his obscure burial,\u2014\nNo trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,\nNo noble rite, nor formal ostentation,\u2014\nCry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,\nThat I must call't in question.\nKING.\nSo you shall.\nAnd where th'offence is let the great axe fall.\nI pray you go with me.",

They say they have letters for you.\nHORATIO.\nLet them come in.\n[_Exit Servant._]\nI do not know from what part of the world\nI should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.\nEnter Sailors.\nFIRST SAILOR.\nGod bless you, sir.\nHORATIO.\nLet him bless thee too.\nFIRST SAILOR.\nHe shall, sir, and't please him. There's a letter for you, sir. It\ncomes from th'ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be\nHoratio, as I am let to know it is.\nHORATIO.\n[_Reads._] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these\nfellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we were\ntwo days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us\nchase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled\nvalour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got\nclear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt\nwith me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I am to do\na good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and\nrepair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have\nwords to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too\nlight for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee\nwhere I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England:\nof them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.\nHe that thou knowest thine,\nHAMLET.'\nCome, I will give you way for these your letters,\nAnd do't the speedier, that you may direct me\nTo him from whom you brought them.\n[_Exeunt._]\nSCENE VII. Another room in the Castle.\nEnter King and Laertes.\nKING.\nNow must your conscience my acquittance seal,\nAnd you must put me in your heart for friend,\nSith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\nThat he which hath your noble father slain\nPursu'd my life.\nLAERTES.\nIt well appears. But tell me\nWhy you proceeded not against these feats,\nSo crimeful and so capital in nature,\nAs by your safety, wisdom, all things else,\nYou mainly were stirr'd up.\nKING.\nO, for two special reasons,\nWhich may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,\nBut yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother\nLives almost by his looks; and for myself,\u2014\nMy virtue or my plague, be it either which,\u2014\nShe's so conjunctive to my life and soul,\nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\nI could not but by her. The other motive,\nWhy to a public count I might not go,\nIs the great love the general gender bear him,\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\nWould like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\nConvert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,\nToo slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\nAnd not where I had aim'd them.\nLAERTES.\nAnd so have I a noble father lost,\nA sister driven into desperate terms,\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\nFor her perfections. But my revenge will come.\nKING.\nBreak not your sleeps for that. You must not think\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger,\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.\nI lov'd your father, and we love ourself,\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine\u2014\nEnter a Messenger.\nHow now? What news?\nMESSENGER.\nLetters, my lord, from Hamlet.\nThis to your Majesty; this to the Queen.\nKING.\nFrom Hamlet! Who brought them?\nMESSENGER.\nSailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.\nThey were given me by Claudio. He receiv'd them\nOf him that brought them.\nKING.\nLaertes, you shall hear them.\nLeave us.\n[_Exit Messenger._]\n[_Reads._] 'High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your\nkingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I\nshall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my\nsudden and more strange return.\nHAMLET.'\nWhat should this mean? Are all the rest come back?\nOr is it some abuse, and no such thing?\nLAERTES.\nKnow you the hand?\nKING.\n'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'\nAnd in a postscript here he says 'alone.'\nCan you advise me?\nLAERTES.\nI am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,\nIt warms the very sickness in my heart\nThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth,\n'Thus diest thou.'\nKING.\nIf it be so, Laertes,\u2014\nAs how should it be so? How otherwise?\u2014\nWill you be rul'd by me?\nLAERTES.\nAy, my lord;\nSo you will not o'errule me to a peace.\nKING.\nTo thine own peace. If he be now return'd,\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\nTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\nAnd for his death no wind shall breathe,\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\nAnd call it accident.\nLAERTES.\nMy lord, I will be rul'd;\nThe rather if you could devise it so\nThat I might be the organ.\nKING.\nIt falls right.\nYou have been talk'd of since your travel much,\nAnd that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality\nWherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\nOf the unworthiest siege.\nLAERTES.\nWhat part is that, my lord?\nKING.\nA very riband in the cap of youth,\nYet needful too, for youth no less becomes\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy,\u2014\nI've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,\nAnd they can well on horseback, but this gallant\nHad witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\nAs had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd\nWith the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought\nThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks,\nCome short of what he did.\nLAERTES.\nA Norman was't?\nKING.\nA Norman.\nLAERTES.\nUpon my life, Lamord.\nKING.\nThe very same.\nLAERTES.\nI know him well. He is the brooch indeed\nAnd gem of all the nation.\nKING.\nHe made confession of you,\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\nFor art and exercise in your defence,\nAnd for your rapier most especially,\nThat he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed\nIf one could match you. The scrimers of their nation\nHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\nIf you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\nYour sudden coming o'er to play with him.\nNow, out of this,\u2014\nLAERTES.\nWhat out of this, my lord?\nKING.\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\nA face without a heart?\nLAERTES.\nWhy ask you this?\nKING.\nNot that I think you did not love your father,\nBut that I know love is begun by time,\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\nThere lives within the very flame of love\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still,\nFor goodness, growing to a pleurisy,\nDies in his own too much. That we would do,\nWe should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\nAnd then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th'ulcer:\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake\nTo show yourself your father's son in deed,\nMore than in words?\nLAERTES.\nTo cut his throat i' th' church.\nKING.\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\nRevenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,\nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.\nHamlet return'd shall know you are come home:\nWe'll put on those shall praise your excellence,\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\nThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together\nAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\nWill not peruse the foils; so that with ease,\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,\nRequite him for your father.\nLAERTES.\nI will do't.\nAnd for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.\nI bought an unction of a mountebank\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\nThis is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point\nWith this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,\nIt may be death.\nKING.\nLet's further think of this,\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\nMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance.\n'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project\nShould have a back or second, that might hold\nIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.\nWe'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,\u2014\nI ha't! When in your motion you are hot and dry,\nAs make your bouts more violent to that end,\nAnd that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him\nA chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,\nIf he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,\nOur purpose may hold there.\nEnter Queen.\nHow now, sweet Queen?\nQUEEN.\nOne woe doth tread upon another's heel,\nSo fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.\nLAERTES.\nDrown'd! O, where?\nQUEEN.\nThere is a willow grows aslant a brook,\nThat shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.\nThere with fantastic garlands did she make\nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\nThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\nBut our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.\nThere on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds\nClamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,\nAnd mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,\nWhich time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,\nAs one incapable of her own distress,\nOr like a creature native and indued\nUnto that element. But long it could not be\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\nPull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay\nTo muddy death.\nLAERTES.\nAlas, then she is drown'd?\nQUEEN.\nDrown'd, drown'd.\nLAERTES.\nToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,\nAnd therefore I forbid my tears. But yet\nIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,\nLet shame say what it will. When these are gone,\nThe woman will be out. Adieu, my lord,\nI have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,\nBut that this folly douts it.\n[_Exit._]\nKING.\nLet's follow, Gertrude;\nHow much I had to do to calm his rage!\nNow fear I this will give it start again;\nTherefore let's follow.\n[_Exeunt._]",

I have done you wrong;\nBut pardon't as you are a gentleman.\nThis presence knows, and you must needs have heard,\nHow I am punish'd with sore distraction.\nWhat I have done\nThat might your nature, honour, and exception\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\nWas't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,\nAnd when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,\nThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\nWho does it, then? His madness. If't be so,\nHamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;\nHis madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\nSir, in this audience,\nLet my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts\nThat I have shot my arrow o'er the house\nAnd hurt my brother.\nLAERTES.\nI am satisfied in nature,\nWhose motive in this case should stir me most\nTo my revenge. But in my terms of honour\nI stand aloof, and will no reconcilement\nTill by some elder masters of known honour\nI have a voice and precedent of peace\nTo keep my name ungor'd. But till that time\nI do receive your offer'd love like love,\nAnd will not wrong it.\nHAMLET.\nI embrace it freely,\nAnd will this brother's wager frankly play.\u2014\nGive us the foils; come on.\nLAERTES.\nCome, one for me.\nHAMLET.\nI'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance\nYour skill shall like a star i' th' darkest night,\nStick fiery off indeed.\nLAERTES.\nYou mock me, sir.\nHAMLET.\nNo, by this hand.\nKING.\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\nYou know the wager?\nHAMLET.\nVery well, my lord.\nYour Grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.\nKING.\nI do not fear it. I have seen you both;\nBut since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.\nLAERTES.\nThis is too heavy. Let me see another.\nHAMLET.\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\n[_They prepare to play._]\nOSRIC.\nAy, my good lord.\nKING.\nSet me the stoups of wine upon that table.\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit,\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire;\nThe King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw\nRicher than that which four successive kings\nIn Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;\nAnd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\nThe trumpet to the cannoneer without,\nThe cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,\n'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.\nAnd you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\nHAMLET.\nCome on, sir.\nLAERTES.\nCome, my lord.\n[_They play._]\nHAMLET.\nOne.\nLAERTES.\nNo.\nHAMLET.\nJudgement.\nOSRIC.\nA hit, a very palpable hit.\nLAERTES.\nWell; again.\nKING.\nStay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;\nHere's to thy health.\n[_Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within._]\nGive him the cup.\nHAMLET.\nI'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.\n[_They play._]\nCome. Another hit; what say you?\nLAERTES.\nA touch, a touch, I do confess.\nKING.\nOur son shall win.\nQUEEN.\nHe's fat, and scant of breath.\nHere, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.\nThe Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nGood madam.\nKING.\nGertrude, do not drink.\nQUEEN.\nI will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.\nKING.\n[_Aside._] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.\nHAMLET.\nI dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.\nQUEEN.\nCome, let me wipe thy face.\nLAERTES.\nMy lord, I'll hit him now.\nKING.\nI do not think't.\nLAERTES.\n[_Aside._] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.\nHAMLET.\nCome for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.\nI pray you pass with your best violence.\nI am afeard you make a wanton of me.\nLAERTES.\nSay you so? Come on.\n[_They play._]\nOSRIC.\nNothing neither way.\nLAERTES.\nHave at you now.\n[_Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and\nHamlet wounds Laertes._]\nKING.\nPart them; they are incens'd.\nHAMLET.\nNay, come again!\n[_The Queen falls._]\nOSRIC.\nLook to the Queen there, ho!\nHORATIO.\nThey bleed on both sides.

Hamlet, thou art slain.\nNo medicine in the world can do thee good.\nIn thee there is not half an hour of life;\nThe treacherous instrument is in thy hand,\nUnbated and envenom'd. The foul practice\nHath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,\nNever to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.\nI can no more. The King, the King's to blame.\nHAMLET.\nThe point envenom'd too!\nThen, venom, to thy work.\n[_Stabs the King._]\nOSRIC and LORDS.\nTreason! treason!\nKING.\nO yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.\nHAMLET.\nHere, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,\nDrink off this potion. Is thy union here?\nFollow my mother.\n[_King dies._]\nLAERTES.\nHe is justly serv'd.\nIt is a poison temper'd by himself.\nExchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.\nMine and my father's death come not upon thee,\nNor thine on me.\n[_Dies._]\nHAMLET.\nHeaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.\nI am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu.\nYou that look pale and tremble at this chance,\nThat are but mutes or audience to this act,\nHad I but time,\u2014as this fell sergeant, death,\nIs strict in his arrest,\u2014O, I could tell you,\u2014\nBut let it be. Horatio, I am dead,\nThou liv'st; report me and my cause aright\nTo the unsatisfied.\nHORATIO.\nNever believe it.\nI am more an antique Roman than a Dane.\nHere's yet some liquor left.\nHAMLET.\nAs th'art a man,\nGive me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I'll have't.\nO good Horatio, what a wounded name,\nThings standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.\nIf thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,\nAbsent thee from felicity awhile,\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,\nTo tell my story.\n[_March afar off, and shot within._]\nWhat warlike noise is this?\nOSRIC.\nYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,\nTo the ambassadors of England gives\nThis warlike volley.\nHAMLET.\nO, I die, Horatio.\nThe potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:\nI cannot live to hear the news from England,\nBut I do prophesy th'election lights\nOn Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.\nSo tell him, with the occurrents more and less,\nWhich have solicited. The rest is silence.\n[_Dies._]\nHORATIO.\nNow cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,\nAnd flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\nWhy does the drum come hither?\n[_March within._]\nEnter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors and others.\nFORTINBRAS.\nWhere is this sight?\nHORATIO.\nWhat is it you would see?\nIf aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.\nFORTINBRAS.\nThis quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,\nWhat feast is toward in thine eternal cell,\nThat thou so many princes at a shot\nSo bloodily hast struck?\nFIRST AMBASSADOR.\nThe sight is dismal;\nAnd our affairs from England come too late.\nThe ears are senseless that should give us hearing,\nTo tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,\nThat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\nWhere should we have our thanks?\nHORATIO.\nNot from his mouth,\nHad it th'ability of life to thank you.\nHe never gave commandment for their death.\nBut since, so jump upon this bloody question,\nYou from the Polack wars, and you from England\nAre here arriv'd, give order that these bodies\nHigh on a stage be placed to the view,\nAnd let me speak to th' yet unknowing world\nHow these things came about. So shall you hear\nOf carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,\nOf accidental judgements, casual slaughters,\nOf deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause,\nAnd, in this upshot, purposes mistook\nFall'n on the inventors' heads. All this can I\nTruly deliver.\nFORTINBRAS.\nLet us haste to hear it,\nAnd call the noblest to the audience.\nFor me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.\nI have some rights of memory in this kingdom,\nWhich now to claim my vantage doth invite me.\nHORATIO.\nOf that I shall have also cause to speak,\nAnd from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.\nBut let this same be presently perform'd,\nEven while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance\nOn plots and errors happen.\nFORTINBRAS.\nLet four captains\nBear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,\nFor he was likely, had he been put on,\nTo have prov'd most royally; and for his passage,\nThe soldiers' music and the rites of war\nSpeak loudly for him.\nTake up the bodies. Such a sight as this\nBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.\nGo, bid the soldiers shoot.",
