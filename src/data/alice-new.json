There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway; \"and even if my head would go through,\" thought\npoor Alice, \"it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\nknew how to begin.\" For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\nindeed were really impossible.",

I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\" (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, \"A mouse\u2014of\na mouse\u2014to a mouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\") The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.\n\"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice; \"I daresay it's\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \"O\u00f9 est ma chatte?\" which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like\ncats.\"",

Do come back again, and we\nwon't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\nhistory, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"",

Pat! Where are you?\" And\nthen a voice she had never heard before, \"Sure then I'm here! Digging\nfor apples, yer honour!\"\n\"Digging for apples, indeed!\" said the Rabbit angrily. \"Here! Come and\nhelp me out of _this!_\" (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\"Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?\"\n\"Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!\" (He pronounced it \"arrum.\")\n\"An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\nwindow!\"\n\"Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.\"\n\"Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\"\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\nnow and then; such as, \"Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at\nall!\" \"Do as I tell you, you coward!\" and at last she spread out her\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \"What a number\nof cucumber-frames there must be!\" thought Alice. \"I wonder what\nthey'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n_could!_ I'm sure _I_ don't want to stay in here any longer!\"\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\ntalking together: she made out the words: \"Where's the other\nladder?\u2014Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other\u2014Bill!\nfetch it here, lad!\u2014Here, put 'em up at this corner\u2014No, tie 'em\ntogether first\u2014they don't reach half high enough yet\u2014Oh! they'll do\nwell enough; don't be particular\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this\nrope\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2014Mind that loose slate\u2014Oh, it's coming down!\nHeads below!\" (a loud crash)\u2014\"Now, who did that?\u2014It was Bill, I\nfancy\u2014Who's to go down the chimney?\u2014Nay, _I_ shan't! _You_ do\nit!\u2014_That_ I won't, then!\u2014Bill's to go down\u2014Here, Bill! the master says\nyou're to go down the chimney!\"",

For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you\nthink you're changed, do you?\"\n\"I'm afraid I am, sir,\" said Alice; \"I can't remember things as I\nused\u2014and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!\"\n\"Can't remember _what_ things?\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Well, I've tried to say \"How doth the little busy bee,\" but it all\ncame different!\" Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n\"Repeat, \"_You are old, Father William_,'\" said the Caterpillar.\nAlice folded her hands, and began:\u2014\n\"You are old, Father William,\" the young man said,\n\"And your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2014\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?\"\n\"In my youth,\" Father William replied to his son,\n\"I feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.\"\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"as I mentioned before,\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\u2014\nPray, what is the reason of that?\"\n\"In my youth,\" said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n\"I kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment\u2014one shilling the box\u2014\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\"\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"and your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2014\nPray, how did you manage to do it?\"\n\"In my youth,\" said his father, \"I took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\"\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"one would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2014\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\"\n\"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\"\nSaid his father; \"don't give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I'll kick you down stairs!\"\n\"That is not said right,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Not _quite_ right, I'm afraid,\" said Alice, timidly; \"some of the\nwords have got altered.\"\n\"It is wrong from beginning to end,\" said the Caterpillar decidedly,\nand there was silence for some minutes.",

And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\"\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n\"Serpent!\" screamed the Pigeon.\n\"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly. \"Let me alone!\"\n\"Serpent, I say again!\" repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, \"I've tried every way, and nothing\nseems to suit them!\"\n\"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,\" said Alice.\n\"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried\nhedges,\" the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \"but those\nserpents! There's no pleasing them!\"\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon;\n\"but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!

Ugh, Serpent!\"\n\"But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a\u2014I'm a\u2014\"\n\"Well! _What_ are you?\" said the Pigeon. \"I can see you're trying to\ninvent something!\"\n\"I\u2014I'm a little girl,\" said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\"A likely story indeed!\" said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. \"I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's\nno use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!\"\n\"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\" said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; \"but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.\"\n\"I don't believe it,\" said the Pigeon; \"but if they do, why then\nthey're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.\"\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \"You're\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\nme whether you're a little girl or a serpent?\"\n\"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I'm not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want\n_yours_: I don't like them raw.\"\n\"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest.

You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis\u2014\"\n\"Talking of axes,\" said the Duchess, \"chop off her head!\"\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\nbe listening, so she went on again: \"Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\nis it twelve? I\u2014\"\n\"Oh, don't bother _me_,\" said the Duchess; \"I never could abide\nfigures!\" And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:\n\"Speak roughly to your little boy,\nAnd beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\nBecause he knows it teases.\"\nCHORUS.\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:\u2014\n\"I speak severely to my boy,\nI beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\nThe pepper when he pleases!\"\nCHORUS.\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\n\"Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room.

The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\nout into the open air. \"If I don't take this child away with me,\"\nthought Alice, \"they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be\nmurder to leave it behind?\" She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n\"Don't grunt,\" said Alice; \"that's not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.\"\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. \"But perhaps it was only\nsobbing,\" she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears.\nNo, there were no tears. \"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,\"\nsaid Alice, seriously, \"I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow!\" The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home?\" when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\nfurther.\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. \"If it had grown up,\" she said to\nherself, \"it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\" And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, \"if one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\" when she",

Visit either you like: they're both mad.\"\n\"But I don't want to go among mad people,\" Alice remarked.\n\"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat: \"we're all mad here. I'm mad.\nYou're mad.\"\n\"How do you know I'm mad?\" said Alice.\n\"You must be,\" said the Cat, \"or you wouldn't have come here.\"\nAlice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on \"And how\ndo you know that you're mad?\"\n\"To begin with,\" said the Cat, \"a dog's not mad. You grant that?\"\n\"I suppose so,\" said Alice.\n\"Well, then,\" the Cat went on, \"you see, a dog growls when it's angry,\nand wags its tail when it's pleased. Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased,\nand wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.\"\n\"_I_ call it purring, not growling,\" said Alice.\n\"Call it what you like,\" said the Cat. \"Do you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?\"\n\"I should like it very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited\nyet.\"\n\"You'll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished.\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\nit suddenly appeared again.\n\"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\" said the Cat. \"I'd nearly\nforgotten to ask.\"\n\"It turned into a pig,\" Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\nin a natural way.\n\"I thought it would,\" said the Cat, and vanished again.\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. \"I've seen hatters before,\" she\nsaid to herself; \"the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.\" As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n\"Did you say pig, or fig?\" said the Cat.\n\"I said pig,\" replied Alice; \"and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\"\n\"All right,\" said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n\"Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,\" thought Alice; \"but a\ngrin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\"",

Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating \"_You are old, Father William_,\" to the\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said \"That's very curious.\"\n\"It's all about as curious as it can be,\" said the Gryphon.\n\"It all came different!\" the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \"I\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now.

It's by far the\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\"\n\"Yes, I think you'd better leave off,\" said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.",

I'm a hatter.\"\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\n\"Give your evidence,\" said the King; \"and don't be nervous, or I'll\nhave you executed on the spot.\"\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter.\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her.\n\"I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.\" said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. \"I can hardly breathe.\"\n\"I can't help it,\" said Alice very meekly: \"I'm growing.\"\n\"You've no right to grow _here_,\" said the Dormouse.\n\"Don't talk nonsense,\" said Alice more boldly: \"you know you're growing\ntoo.\"\n\"Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,\" said the Dormouse: \"not in\nthat ridiculous fashion.\" And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\nto the other side of the court.\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, \"Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\"\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\noff.\n\"Give your evidence,\" the King repeated angrily, \"or I'll have you\nexecuted, whether you're nervous or not.\"\n\"I'm a poor man, your Majesty,\" the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n\"\u2014and I hadn't begun my tea\u2014not above a week or so\u2014and what with the\nbread-and-butter getting so thin\u2014and the twinkling of the tea\u2014\"\n\"The twinkling of the _what?_\" said the King.\n\"It _began_ with the tea,\" the Hatter replied.\n\"Of course twinkling begins with a T!\" said the King sharply. \"Do you\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!\"\n\"I'm a poor man,\" the Hatter went on, \"and most things twinkled after\nthat\u2014only the March Hare said\u2014\"\n\"I didn't!\" the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\"You did!\" said the Hatter.\n\"I deny it!\" said the March Hare.\n\"He denies it,\" said the King: \"leave out that part.\"\n\"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said\u2014\" the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.\n\"After that,\" continued the Hatter, \"I cut some more bread-and-butter\u2014\"\n\"But what did the Dormouse say?\" one of the jury asked.\n\"That I can't remember,\" said the Hatter.\n\"You _must_ remember,\" remarked the King, \"or I'll have you executed.\"\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, your Majesty,\" he began.\n\"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King.\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\n\"I'm glad I've seen that done,\" thought Alice. \"I've so often read in\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts at\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\ncourt,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.\"\n\"If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,\" continued the\nKing.\n\"I can't go no lower,\" said the Hatter: \"I'm on the floor, as it is.\"\n\"Then you may _sit_ down,\" the King replied.\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\"Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!\" thought Alice. \"Now we shall get\non better.\"\n\"I'd rather finish my tea,\" said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n\"You may go,\" said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\n\"\u2014and just take his head off outside,\" the Queen added to one of the\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\nto the door.",
