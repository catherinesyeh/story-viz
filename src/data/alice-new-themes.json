First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled \"ORANGE MARMALADE\", but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\"Well!\" thought Alice to herself, \"after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!\" (Which was very likely true.)\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \"I wonder how\nmany miles I've fallen by this time?\" she said aloud. \"I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\" (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) \"\u2014yes, that's about the right distance\u2014but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?\" (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\nPresently she began again. \"I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\" (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all\nthe right word) \"\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\"\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you're\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \"And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\"\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\"\n(Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\" And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, \"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\" and\nsometimes, \"Do bats eat cats?\" for, you see, as she couldn't answer\neither question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n\"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.",

There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.

No, I've\nmade up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying 'Come up again, dear!'\nI shall only look up and say 'Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down\nhere till I'm somebody else'\u2014but, oh dear!\" cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, \"I do wish they _would_ put their heads down!

However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.\n\"I wish I hadn't cried so much!\" said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. \"I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears!

She\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n\"Serpent!\" screamed the Pigeon.\n\"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly. \"Let me alone!\"\n\"Serpent, I say again!\" repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, \"I've tried every way, and nothing\nseems to suit them!\"\n\"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,\" said Alice.\n\"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried\nhedges,\" the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \"but those\nserpents! There's no pleasing them!\"\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon;\n\"but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\nhaven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\"\n\"I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,\" said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.\n\"And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\"\n\"But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a\u2014I'm a\u2014\"\n\"Well! _What_ are you?\" said the Pigeon. \"I can see you're trying to\ninvent something!\"\n\"I\u2014I'm a little girl,\" said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\"A likely story indeed!\" said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. \"I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's\nno use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!\"\n\"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\" said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; \"but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.\"\n\"I don't believe it,\" said the Pigeon; \"but if they do, why then\nthey're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.\"\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \"You're\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\nme whether you're a little girl or a serpent?\"\n\"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I'm not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want\n_yours_: I don't like them raw.\"\n\"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until",

No room!\" they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming. \"There's _plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n\"Have some wine,\" the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n\"I don't see any wine,\" she remarked.\n\"There isn't any,\" said the March Hare.\n\"Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,\" said Alice angrily.\n\"It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\" said\nthe March Hare.\n\"I didn't know it was _your_ table,\" said Alice; \"it's laid for a great\nmany more than three.\"\n\"Your hair wants cutting,\" said the Hatter. He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech.\n\"You should learn not to make personal remarks,\" Alice said with some\nseverity; \"it's very rude.\"\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\nwas, \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"\n\"Come, we shall have some fun now!\" thought Alice. \"I'm glad they've\nbegun asking riddles.\u2014I believe I can guess that,\" she added aloud.\n\"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said\nthe March Hare.\n\"Exactly so,\" said Alice.\n\"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.\n\"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least\u2014at least I mean what I\nsay\u2014that's the same thing, you know.\"\n\"Not the same thing a bit!\" said the Hatter. \"You might just as well\nsay that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!\"\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the March Hare, \"that 'I like what\nI get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!\"\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing\nas 'I sleep when I breathe'!\"\n\"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn't much.\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \"What day of the month\nis it?\" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.\nAlice considered a little, and then said \"The fourth.\"\n\"Two days wrong!\" sighed the Hatter. \"I told you butter wouldn't suit\nthe works!\" he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n\"It was the _best_ butter,\" the March Hare meekly replied.\n\"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\" the Hatter grumbled:\n\"you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.\"\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \"It was the _best_ butter,\nyou know.\"\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \"What a\nfunny watch!\" she remarked. \"It tells the day of the month, and doesn't\ntell what o'clock it is!\"\n\"Why should it?\" muttered the Hatter. \"Does _your_ watch tell you what\nyear it is?\"\n\"Of course not,\" Alice replied very readily: \"but that's because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\"\n\"Which is just the case with _mine_,\" said the Hatter.\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \"I don't quite\nunderstand you,\" she said, as politely as she could.\n\"The Dormouse is asleep again,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, \"Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\"\n\"Have you guessed the riddle yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.\n\"No, I give it up,\" Alice replied: \"what's the answer?\"\n\"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the Hatter.\n\"Nor I,\" said the March Hare.\nAlice sighed wearily. \"I think you might do something better with the\ntime,\" she said, \"than waste it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.\"\n\"If you knew Time as well as I do,\" said the Hatter, \"you wouldn't talk\nabout wasting _it_. It's _him_.\"\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Alice.\n\"Of course you don't!\" the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. \"I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\"\n\"Perhaps not,\" Alice cautiously replied: \"but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.\"\n\"Ah! that accounts for it,\" said the Hatter. \"He won't stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!\"\n(\"I only wish it was,\" the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n\"That would be grand, certainly,\" said Alice thoughtfully: \"but then\u2014I\nshouldn't be hungry for it, you know.\"\n\"Not at first, perhaps,\" said the Hatter: \"but you could keep it to\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.\"\n\"Is that the way _you_ manage?\" Alice asked.\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \"Not I!\" he replied. \"We\nquarrelled last March\u2014just before _he_ went mad, you know\u2014\" (pointing\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \"\u2014it was at the great concert\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you're at!'\nYou know the song, perhaps?\"\n\"I've heard something like it,\" said Alice.\n\"It goes on, you know,\" the Hatter continued, \"in this way:\u2014\n'Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle\u2014'\"\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n\"_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_\u2014\" and went on so long that they\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\n\"Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,\" said the Hatter, \"when the\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, 'He's murdering the time! Off with his\nhead!'\"\n\"How dreadfully savage!\" exclaimed Alice.\n\"And ever since that,\" the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \"he won't\ndo a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.\"\nA bright idea came into Alice's head. \"Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?\" she asked.\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said the Hatter with a sigh: \"it's always tea-time,\nand we've no time to wash the things between whiles.\"\n\"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\" said Alice.\n\"Exactly so,\" said the Hatter: \"as the things get used up.\"\n\"But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\" Alice ventured\nto ask.\n\"Suppose we change the subject,\" the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n\"I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\"\n\"I'm afraid I don't know one,\" said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal.\n\"Then the Dormouse shall!\" they both cried. \"Wake up, Dormouse!\" And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \"I wasn't asleep,\" he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice: \"I heard every word you fellows were saying.\"\n\"Tell us a story!\" said the March Hare.\n\"Yes, please do!\" pleaded Alice.\n\"And be quick about it,\" added the Hatter, \"or you'll be asleep again\nbefore it's done.\"\n\"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\" the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry; \"and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well\u2014\"\n\"What did they live on?\" said Alice, who always took a great interest\nin questions of eating and drinking.\n\"They lived on treacle,\" said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.\n\"They couldn't have done that, you know,\" Alice gently remarked;\n\"they'd have been ill.\"\n\"So they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"_very_ ill.\"\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \"But\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\n\"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't\ntake more.\"\n\"You mean you can't take _less_,\" said the Hatter: \"it's very easy to\ntake _more_ than nothing.\"\n\"Nobody asked _your_ opinion,\" said Alice.\n\"Who's making personal remarks now?\" the Hatter asked triumphantly.\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. \"Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, \"It was a treacle-well.\"\n\"There's no such thing!\" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went \"Sh! sh!\" and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked, \"If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for\nyourself.\"\n\"No, please go on!\" Alice said very humbly; \"I won't interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be _one_.\"\n\"One, indeed!\" said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\ngo on. \"And so these three little sisters\u2014they were learning to draw,\nyou know\u2014\"\n\"What did they draw?\" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n\"Treacle,\" said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n\"I want a clean cup,\" interrupted the Hatter: \"let's all move one place\non.\"\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: \"But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?\"\n\"You can draw water out of a water-well,\" said the Hatter; \"so I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well\u2014eh, stupid?\"\n\"But they were _in_ the well,\" Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\nto notice this last remark.\n\"Of course they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"\u2014well in.\"\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.\n\"They were learning to draw,\" the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \"and they drew all manner of\nthings\u2014everything that begins with an M\u2014\"\n\"Why with an M?\" said Alice.\n\"Why not?\" said the March Hare.\nAlice was silent.\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: \"\u2014that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014you know you say\nthings are \"much of a muchness\"\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?\"\n\"Really, now you ask me,\" said Alice, very much confused, \"I don't\nthink\u2014\"\n\"Then you shouldn't talk,\" said the Hatter.\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.",

Go on!\"\n\"I'm a poor man,\" the Hatter went on, \"and most things twinkled after\nthat\u2014only the March Hare said\u2014\"\n\"I didn't!\" the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\"You did!\" said the Hatter.\n\"I deny it!\" said the March Hare.\n\"He denies it,\" said the King: \"leave out that part.\"\n\"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said\u2014\" the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.\n\"After that,\" continued the Hatter, \"I cut some more bread-and-butter\u2014\"\n\"But what did the Dormouse say?\" one of the jury asked.\n\"That I can't remember,\" said the Hatter.\n\"You _must_ remember,\" remarked the King, \"or I'll have you executed.\"\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, your Majesty,\" he began.\n\"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King.",
