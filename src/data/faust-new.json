Thy raptured eyes\nShall then behold what force compels\nThe tuneful spheres to chime together;\nWhen, taught by Nature's mightiest spells,\nThine innate spring of soul upwells,\nAs speaks one spirit to another.\nIn vain my thought gropes blindly here,\nTo make those sacred symbols clear;\nYe unseen Powers that hover near me,\nAnswer, I charge ye, when ye hear me!\n[_He opens the book, and sees the sign of the Macrocosm._][*n2]\nHa! what ecstatic joy this page reveals,\nAt once through all my thrilling senses flowing!\nYoung holy zest of life my spirit feels\nIn every vein, in every nerve, new glowing!\nWas it a God whose finger drew these signs,\nThat, with mild pulse of joy, and breath of rest,\nSmooth the tumultuous heaving of my breast,\nAnd with mysterious virtue spread the lines\nOf Nature's cipher bare to mortal sight?\nAm I a God? so wondrous pure the light\nWithin me! in these tokens I behold\nThe powers by which all Nature is besouled.\nNow may I reach the sage's words aright;\n\"The world of spirits is not barred;\nThy sense is shut, thy heart is dead!\nUp, scholars, bathe your hearts so hard,\nIn the fresh dew of morning's red!\"\n[_He scans carefully the sign._]\nHow mingles here in one the soul with soul,\nAnd lives each portion in the living whole!\nHow heavenly Powers, ascending and descending,\nFrom hand to hand their golden ewers are lending,\nAnd bliss-exhaling swing from pole to pole!\nFrom the high welkin to earth's centre bounding,\nHarmonious all through the great All resounding!\nWhat wondrous show! but ah! 'tis but a show!\nWhere grasp I thee, thou infinite Nature, where?\nAnd you, ye teeming breasts? ye founts whence flow\nAll living influences fresh and fair?\nWhereon the heavens and earth dependent hang,\nWhere seeks relief the withered bosom's pang?\nYour founts still well, and I must pine in vain!\n[_He turns the book over impatiently, and beholds the sign of the\nSpirit of the Earth._]\nWhat different working hath this sign?\nThou Spirit of the Earth, I feel thee nearer;\nAlready sees my strengthened spirit clearer;\nI glow as I had drunk new wine.\nNew strength I feel to plunge into the strife,\nAnd bear the woes and share the joys of life,\nBuffet the blasts, and where the wild waves dash,\nLook calmly on the shipwreck's fearful crash!\nClouds hover o'er me--\nThe moon is dim!\nThe lamp's flame wanes!\nIt smokes!--Red beams dart forth\nAround my head--and from the vaulted roof\nFalls a cold shudder down,\nAnd grips me!--I feel\nThou hover'st near me, conjured Spirit, now;\nReveal thee!\nHa! how swells with wild delight\nMy bursting heart!\nAnd feelings, strange and new,\nAt once through all my ravished senses dart!\nI feel my inmost soul made thrall to thee!\nThou must! thou must! and were my life the fee!\n[_He seizes the book, and pronounces with a mysterious air the sign\nof the Spirit.

O, then,\nWhat precious stuff they dish, and call't a book,\nYour stomach turns at the first look;\nA heap of rubbish, and a lumber room,\nAt best some great state farce with proclamations,\nPragmatic maxims, protocols, orations,\nSuch as from puppet-mouths do fitly come!\nWagner.\nBut then the world!--the human heart and mind!\nSomewhat of this to know are all inclined.\nFaust.\nYes! as such knowledge goes! but what man dares\nTo call the child by the true name it bears?\nThe noble few that something better knew,\nAnd to the gross reach of the general view,\nTheir finer feelings bared, and insight true,\nFrom oldest times were burnt and crucified.\nI do beseech thee, friend--'tis getting late,\n'Twere wise to put an end to our debate.\nWagner.\nSuch learned talk to draw through all the night\nWith Doctor Faust were my supreme delight;\nBut on the morrow, being Easter, I\nYour patience with some questions more may try.\nWith zeal I've followed Learning's lofty call,\nMuch I have learned, but fain would master all.

In this wise generation\nThe Northern phantom is no longer seen,\nAnd horns and tail and claws have been.\nAnd for my hoof, with which I can't dispense,\nIn good society 'twould give great offence;\nTherefore, like many a smart sprig of nobility,\nI use false calves to trick out my gentility.\nThe Witch. [_dancing_]\nHeyday! it almost turns my brain\nTo see Squire Satan here again!\nMephistopheles.\nWoman, you must not call me by that name!\nThe Witch.\nAnd wherefore not? I see no cause for shame.\nMephistopheles.\nThat name has had its station long assigned\nWith Mother Bunch; and yet I cannot see\nMen are much better for the want of me.\nThe wicked one is gone, the wicked stay behind.\nCall me now Baron, less than that were rude--\nI am a cavalier like other cavaliers;\nMy line is noble, and my blood is good;\nHere is a coat of arms that all the world reveres.\n[_He makes an indecent gesture._\nThe Witch. [_laughing immoderately_]\nHa! ha! now I perceive Old Nick is here!\nYou are a rogue still, as you always were.\nMephistopheles. [_aside to_ /Faust/]\nMy friend, I give you here, your wit to whet,\nA little lesson in witch-etiquette.\nThe Witch.\nNow say, good sirs, what would you have with me?\nMephistopheles.\nA glass of your restoring liquor,\nThat makes an old man's blood run quicker:\nAnd bring the best out from your bins;\nWith years the juice in virtue wins.\nThe Witch.\nMost willingly. Here I have got a phial\nOf which myself at times make trial:\n'Tis now a pleasant mellow potion;\nYou shall not meet with a denial.\n[_Softly._] Yet if this worthy man drinks it without precaution,\nHis life can't stand an hour against its strong infection.\nMephistopheles.\nLeave that to me; he's under my protection,\nRipe for the draught; no harm will come to him.\n[_The_ /Witch/, _with strange gestures, draws a circle and places\nmany curious things within it; meanwhile the glasses begin to tinkle,\nand the kettle to sound and make music. She brings a large book, puts\nthe_ /Cat-Apes/ _into the circle, and makes them serve as a desk to\nlay the book on, and hold the torches. She motions to_ /Faust/ _to\ncome near._\nFaust.

I fear\nThere's something in it not right altogether. [_Knocking._]\nGood God!--I hear a step--is it my mother?\nMartha. [_looking through the casement_]\n'Tis a strange gentleman. Come in!\n_Enter_ /Mephistopheles/.\nMephistopheles.\nI hope the ladies will not think me rude,\nThat uninvited thus I here intrude.\n[_Observing_ /Margaret/, _he draws back respectfully._]\nI have commands for Mistress Martha Schwerdtlein.\nMartha.\nFor me? what has the gentleman to say?\nMephistopheles. [_softly to her_]\nExcuse my freedom. I perceive that you\nHave visitors of rank to-day;\nFor this time I shall bid adieu,\nAnd after dinner do myself the pleasure\nTo wait upon you, when you're more at leisure.\nMartha. [_aloud_]\nThink, child! of all things in the world the last!\nMy Gretchen for a lady should have passed!\nMargaret.\nThe gentleman is far too good;\nI'm a poor girl--boast neither wealth nor blood.\nThis dress, these jewels, are not mine.\nMephistopheles.\n'Tis not the dress alone that I admire;\nShe has a mien, a gait, a look so fine,\nThat speak the lady more than costliest attire.\nMartha.\nAnd now your business, sir? I much desire--\nMephistopheles.\nWould God I had a better tale to tell!\nSmall thanks I should receive, I knew it well.\nYour husband's dead--his last fond words I bear.\nMartha.\nIs dead! the good fond soul! O woe!\nMy man is dead! flow, sorrow, flow!\nMargaret.\nBeseech thee, dearest Martha, don't despair.\nMephistopheles.\nNow hear my mournful story to the end.\nMargaret.\nI would not love a man on earth, to rend\nMe thus with grief, when he might hap to die.\nMephistopheles.\nJoy hath its sorrow, sorrow hath its joy;\nTwin sisters are they, as the proverb saith.\nMartha.\nNow let me hear the manner of his death.\nMephistopheles.\nWhere Padua's sacred turrets rise,\nAbove the grave of holy Antony,\nOn consecrated ground thy husband lies,\nAnd slumbers for eternity.\nMartha.\nNo further message? is this all?\nMephistopheles.\nYes! one request, and that not small.\nFor his soul's peace, your good man wanted\nThree hundred masses to be chanted.\nThis is the whole of my commission.\nMartha.\nWhat! not a jewel? not a coin?\nNo journeyman, however poor,\nHowever wild, could make such an omission,\nBut in the bottom of his pouch is sure\nTo keep some small memorial for his wife,\nAnd rather beg, and rather pine\nAway the remnant of his life--\nMephistopheles.\nMadam! for your hard case I greatly grieve,\nBut your good husband had no gold to leave.\nHis sins and follies he lamented sore--\nYes! and bewailed his own mishap much more.\nMargaret.\nAlas for all the miseries of mankind!\nHe shall not want my oft-repeated prayer.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Margaret/]\nThou, gentle heart, dost well deserve to find\nA husband worthy of a bride so fair.\nMargaret.\nAh no!--for that, it is too soon.\nMephistopheles.\nA lover, then, might in the meantime do.\n'Tis bounteous Heaven's choicest boon\nTo fondle in one's arms so sweet a thing as you.\nMargaret.\nSuch things are never done with us.\nMephistopheles.\nDone or not done!--it may be managed thus:--\nMartha.\nNow let me hear!\nMephistopheles.\nBy his death-bed I stood.\nIt was a little better than of dung,\nOf mouldy straw; there, as a Christian should,\nWith many a sin repented on his tongue,\nHe died.--\"Oh! how must I,\" he said,\n\"Myself detest so to throw up my trade,\nAnd my dear wife abandon so!\nIt kills me with the simple memory, oh!\nMight she but now forgive me, ere I die!\"\nMartha. [_weeping_]\nGood soul! I have forgiven him long ago.\nMephistopheles. [_continuing his interrupted narrative_]\nAnd yet was she, God knows, much more to blame than I.\nMartha.\nWhat! did he lie? on the grave's brink to lie!\nMephistopheles.\nHe fabled to the last, be sure,\nIf I am half a connoisseur.\n\"In sooth, I had no time to gape,\" he said,\n\"First to get children, then to get them bread,\nTo clothe them, and to put them to a trade,\nFrom toil and labor I had no release,\nAnd could not even eat my own thin slice in peace.\"\nMartha.\nCan it then be? has he forgotten quite\nMy fag and drudgery, by day and night?\nMephistopheles.\nNot quite! attend the sequel of my tale.\n\"When last we sailed from Malta\"--so he said,\n\"For wife and children fervently I prayed,\nAnd Heaven then blew a favorable gale.\nWe came across a Turkish ship that bore\nHome bullion to increase the Sultan's store,\nAnd soon, by valor's right, were masters\nOf all the Infidel piastres;\nThe precious spoil was shared among the crew,\nAnd I received the part that was my due.\"\nMartha.\nBut where and how?--has he then buried it?\nMephistopheles.\nWho knows where the four winds have hurried it!\nA lady took him under her protection\nAt Naples, as he wandered to and fro;\nShe left him many a mark of her affection,\nAs to his life's end he had cause to know.\nMartha.\nThe knave, to treat his helpless orphans so!\nTo all our misery and all our need,\nAmid his reckless life, he gave no heed!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd for that cause he's dead. If I were you,\nNow mark me well, I tell you what I'd do;\nI'd mourn him decently for one chaste year,\nThen look about me for another dear.\nMartha.\nAlas! God knows it would be hard to find\nAnother so completely to my mind.\nA better-hearted fool you never knew,\nA love of roving was his only vice;\nAnd foreign wine, and foreign women too,\nAnd the accurs\u00e8d gambling dice.\nMephistopheles.\nSuch marriage-articles were most convenient,\nHad he to you been only half so lenient.\nOn terms like these myself had no objection\nTo change with you the ring of conjugal affection.\nMartha.\nYou jest, mein Herr!\nMephistopheles. [_aside_]\nA serious jest for me!\nI'd better go; for, if I tarry here,\nShe'll take the devil at his word, I fear.\n[_To_ /Margaret/.] How stands it with your heart then?--is it free?\nMargaret.\nI scarce know what you mean.\nMephistopheles.\nSweet guileless heart!\nLadies, farewell!\nMargaret.\nFarewell!\nMartha.\nOne word before we part!\nI fain would have it solemnly averred,\nHow my dear husband died, and where he was interred.\nOrder was aye my special virtue; and\n'Tis right both where and when he died should stand\nIn the newspapers.\nMephistopheles.\nYes, when two attest,\nAs Scripture saith, the truth is manifest.\nI have a friend, who, at your requisition,\nBefore the judge will make a deposition.\nI'll bring him here.\nMartha.\nYes, bring him with you, do!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd we shall meet your fair young lady too?\n[_To_ /Margaret/.] A gallant youth!--has been abroad, and seen\nThe world--a perfect cavalier, I trow.\nMargaret.\n'Twould make me blush, should he bestow\nA single look on one so mean.\nMephistopheles.\nYou have no cause to be ashamed before\nThe proudest king that ever sceptre bore.\nMartha.\nThis evening, in the garden then, behind\nThe house, you'll find warm hearts and welcome kind!\nScene VIII.",

Thou gav'st me with this joy,\nWhich brings me near and nearer to the gods,\nA fellow, whom I cannot do without.\nAll cold and heartless, he debases me\nBefore myself, and, with a single breath,\nBlows all the bounties of thy love to nought;\nAnd fans within my breast a raging fire\nFor that fair image, busy to do ill.\nThus reel I from desire on to enjoyment,\nAnd in enjoyment languish for desire.\n_Enter_ /Mephistopheles/.\nMephistopheles.\nWhat! not yet tired of meditation?\nMethinks this is a sorry recreation.\nTo try it once or twice might do;\nBut then, again to something new.\nFaust.\nYou might employ your time some better way\nThan thus to plague me on a happy day.\nMephistopheles.\nWell, well! I do not grudge you quiet,\nYou need my aid, and you cannot deny it.\nThere is not much to lose, I trow,\nWith one so harsh, and gruff, and mad as thou.\nToil! moil! from morn to ev'n, so on it goes!\nAnd what one should, and what one should not do,\nOne cannot always read it on your nose.\nFaust.\nThis is the proper tone for you!\nAnnoy me first, and then my thanks are due.\nMephistopheles.\nPoor son of Earth! without my timed assistance,\nHow had you ever dragged on your existence?\nFrom freakish fancy's fevered effervescence,\nI have worked long ago your convalescence,\nAnd, but for me, you would have marched away,\nIn your best youth, from the blest light of day.\nWhat have you here, in caves and clefts, to do,\nLike an old owl, screeching to-whit, to-whoo?\nOr like a torpid toad, that sits alone\nSipping the oozing moss and dripping stone?\nA precious condition to be in!\nI see the Doctor sticks yet in your skin.\nFaust.\nCouldst thou but know what re-born vigor springs\nFrom this lone wandering in the wilderness,\nCouldst thou conceive what heavenly joy it brings,\nThen wert thou fiend enough to envy me my bliss.\nMephistopheles.\nA supermundane bliss!\nIn night and dew to lie upon the height,\nAnd clasp the heaven and earth in wild delight,\nTo swell up to the godhead's stature,\nAnd pierce with clear miraculous sight\nThe inmost pith of central Nature,\nTo carry in your breast with strange elation,\nThe ferment of the whole six days' creation,\nWith proud anticipation of--I know\nNot what--to glow in rapturous overflow,\nAnd melt into the universal mind,\nCasting the paltry son of earth behind;\nAnd then, the heaven-sprung intuition\n[_With a gesture._] To end--I shall not say in what--fruition.\nFaust.\nShame on thee!\nMephistopheles.\nYes! that's not quite to your mind.\nYou have a privilege to cry out shame,\nWhen things are mentioned by their proper name.\nBefore chaste ears one may not dare to spout\nWhat chastest hearts yet cannot do without.\nI do not envy you the pleasure\nOf palming lies upon yourself at leisure;\nBut long it cannot last, I warrant thee.\nYou are returned to your old whims, I see,\nAnd, at this rate, you soon will wear\nYour strength away, in madness and despair.\nOf this enough! thy love sits waiting thee,\nIn doubt and darkness, cabined and confined.\nBy day, by night, she has thee in her mind;\nI trow she loves thee in no common kind.\nThy raging passion 'gan to flow,\nLike a torrent in spring from melted snow;\nInto her heart thy tide gushed high,\nNow is thy shallow streamlet dry.\nInstead of standing here to overbrim\nWith fine ecstatic rapture to the trees,\nMethinks the mighty gentleman might please\nTo drop some words of fond regard, to ease\nThe sweet young chick who droops and pines for him.\nPoor thing, she is half dead of ennui,\nAnd at the window stands whole hours, to see\nThe clouds pass by the old town-wall along.\nWere I a little bird! so goes her song\nThe live-long day, and half the night to boot.\nSometimes she will be merry, mostly sad,\nNow, like a child, weeping her sorrows out,\nNow calm again to look at, never glad;\nAlways in love.\nFaust.\nThou snake! thou snake!\nMephistopheles. [_to himself_]\nSo be it! that my guile thy stubborn will may break!\nFaust.\nHence and begone, thou son of filth and fire!\nName not the lovely maid again!\nBring not that overmastering desire\nOnce more to tempt my poor bewildered brain!\nMephistopheles.\nWhat then? she deems that you are gone forever;\nAnd half and half methinks you are.\nFaust.\nNo! I am nigh, and were I ne'er so far,\nI could forget her, I could lose her never;\nI envy ev'n the body of the Lord,\nWhen on the sacred cake her lips she closes.\nMephistopheles.\nYes! to be honest, and confess my sins,\nI oft have envied thee the lovely twins\nThat have their fragrant pasture among roses.\nFaust.\nAvaunt, thou pimp!\nMephistopheles.\nRail you, and I will laugh;\nThe God who made the human stuff\nBoth male and female, if the book don't lie,\nHimself the noblest trade knew well enough,\nHow to carve out an opportunity.\nBut come, why peak and pine you here?\nI lead you to the chamber of your dear,\nNot to the gallows.\nFaust.\nAh! what were Heaven's supremest blessedness\nWithin her arms, upon her breast, to me!\nMust I not still be wrung with agony,\nThat I should plunge her into such distress?\nI, the poor fugitive! outlaw from my kind,\nWithout a friend, without a home,\nWith restless heart, and aimless mind,\nUnblest, unblessing, ever doomed to roam;\nWho, like a waterfall, from rock to rock came roaring,\nWith greedy rage into the caldron pouring;\nWhile she, a heedless infant, rears\nSidewards her hut upon the Alpine field,\nWith all her hopes, and all her fears,\nWithin this little world concealed.\nAnd I--the God-detested--not content\nTo seize the rocks, and in my headlong bent\nTo shatter them to dust, with ruthless tide\nHer little shielding on the mountain side\nBore down, and wrecked her life's sweet peace with mine.\nAnd such an offering, Hell, must it be thine?\nHelp, Devil, to cut short the hour of ill!\nWhat happen must, may happen when it will!\nMay her sad fate my crashing fall attend,\nAnd she with me be ruined in the end!\nMephistopheles.\nLo! how it boils again and blows\nLike furnace, wherefore no man knows.\nGo in, thou fool, and let her borrow\nFrom thee, sweet solace to her sorrow!\nWhen such a brainsick dreamer sees\nNo road, where he to walk may please,\nHe stands and stares like Balaam's ass,\nAs if a god did block the pass.\nA man's a man who does and dares!\nIn other points you're spiced not scantly with the devil;\nNothing more silly moves on earth's wide level,\nThan is a devil who despairs.\nScene IV.",

Beware,\nArt thou a wise man, of her glossy hair!\n'Tis fair to look on, but its look is fell.\nThose locks with which she outshines all the train,\nWhen she hath bound a young man with that chain,\nShe'll hold him fast; he'll scarce come back again.\nFaust.\nThere sit an old and young one on the sward;\nThey seem to have been dancing somewhat hard.\nMephistopheles.\nO! once begun, they'll go on like the devil.\nCome, come! they rise again--let's join the revel.\n[/Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/ _join the dance; the former\nwith the Young Witch as his partner; the latter with the Old one._\nFaust. [_dancing with the young Witch_]\nA lovely dream once came to me,\nI saw in my sleep an apple-tree;\nTwo lovely apples on it did shine;\nI clomb the pole to make them mine.\nThe Young Witch.\nFor apples your sire in Paradise\nAnd primal dame had longing eyes:\nAnd, if your eyes are wise to see,\nYou'll find such apples on my tree.\nMephistopheles. [_dancing with the old Witch_]\nAn ugly dream once came to me,\nI dreamed I saw a cloven tree;\nIn the tree there sat an ugly owl;\nI called it fair, though it was foul.\nThe Old Witch.\nMy best salute this night shall be,\nThou knight of the cloven foot, to thee;\nA cloven tree with an ugly owl,\nAnd I for thee, or fair, or foul.\nProctophantasmist.[*n14] [_to the dancers_]\nListen to order, you presumptuous brood!\nHave we not proved beyond disputing,\nThat ghosts on terra firma have no footing?\nAnd yet you dance like any flesh and blood?\nThe Young Witch. [_dancing_]\nWhat wants he here, that rude-like fellow there?\nFaust. [_dancing_]\nO, he is everywhere!\nWhat others dance 'tis his to prize;\nEach step he cannot criticise\nHad as well not been made. But in the dance\nIt grieves him most when we advance.\nIf we would wheel still round and round in a ring,\nAs he is fond to do in his old mill,\nHe would not take it half so ill;\nEspecially if you take care to bring\nYour praiseful offering to his master skill.\nProctophantasmist.\nWhat! still there, phantoms? this is past endurance!\nIn this enlightened age you have the assurance\nTo show your face and play your tricks undaunted;\nWe are so wise, and yet a man's own house is haunted.\nHow long have I not swept the cobwebs of delusion,\nAnd still the world remains in the same wild confusion!\nThe Young Witch.\nBe quiet then, and seek some other place!\nProctophantasmist.\nI tell you, Spirits, in your face,\nThis intellectual thrall I cannot bear it;\nI love to have a free unshackled spirit. [_The dance goes on._]\nTo-day I see that all my strength is spent in vain;\nI've had a tour, at least, to compensate my evils,\nAnd hope, before I come to Blocksberg back again,\nTo crush, with one good stroke, the poets and the devils.\nMephistopheles.\nHe will now go, and, bare of breeches,\nSit in a pool with solemn patience;\nAnd, when his buttocks are well sucked by leeches,\nBe cured of ghosts and ghostly inspirations.\n[_To_ /Faust/, _who has just left the dance._]\nWhy do you let the lovely damsel go,\nThat in the dance with sweet song pleased you so?\nFaust.\nAlas! while she so passing sweet was singing,\nI saw a red mouse from her mouth outspringing.\nMephistopheles.\nPooh! on the Brocken that's a thing of course;\nLet not such trifles mar your sweet discourse.\nGo, join the crew, and dance away;\nEnough, the red mouse was not gray.\nFaust.\nThen saw I--\nMephistopheles.\nWhat?\nFaust.\nMephisto, see'st thou there\nA pale yet lovely girl, in lonely distance fare?\nFrom place to place she moveth slow;\nWith shackled feet she seems to go;\nI must confess, she has a cast\nOf Margaret, when I saw her last.\nMephistopheles.\nLet that alone! it brings thee certain harm;\nIt is bewitched, a bloodless, breathless form,\nFor men to look upon it is not good.\nIts fix\u00e8d gaze hath power to freeze the blood,\nAnd petrify thee stark and stiff.\nOf course I need not ask you if\nYou've heard of the Medusa's head.\nFaust.\nIn truth I see the eyes of one that's dead,\nOn which no closing hand of love was laid.\nThat is my Margaret's kindly breast,\nThat the sweet body I caressed.\nMephistopheles.\nThere lies the witchcraft o't, thou fool!\nA phantom takes thy wit to school:\nShe is the love of every lover's brain.\nFaust.\nWhat ecstasy! and yet what pain!\nI cannot leave it for my life.\nHow strangely this most lovely neck\nA single streak of red doth deck,\nNo broader than the back o' a knife!\nMephistopheles.\nQuite right! I see it, just as well as you.\nSometimes her head beneath her elbow too\nShe wears; for Perseus cut it off, you know.\nWhat! will you still a-dreaming go?\nCome, let us mount the hillock--there\nWe shall have noble sport, believe me;\nFor, unless mine eyes deceive me,\nThey have got up a theatre.\nWhat make you here?\nA Servant.\nYou are just come in time.\n'Tis a new piece, the last of all the seven,\nFor such the number that with us is given.\nA dilettante 'twas that wrote the rhyme,\nAnd dilettanti are the actors too.\nExcuse me, sirs,--no disrespect to you,\nIf I seem curt: I am the dilettante\nTo draw the curtain; and our time is scanty.\nMephistopheles.\nJust so; I only wish you were so clever\nTo know your home;\nThen from the Blocksberg you would never\nHave lust to roam!\nScene II.",

O God! what hast thou done?\nPut up thy sword;\nI pray thee put it up.\nFaust.\nLet gone be gone!\nThou stabbest me with daggers, every word.\nMargaret.\nNo! thou shalt survive our sorrow!\nI will describe the graves to thee,\nWhere thou shalt bury them and me\nTo-morrow.\nThe best place thou shalt give my mother;\nClose beside her lay my brother;\nMe a little to the side,\nBut at distance not too wide!\nAnd my child at my right breast.--\nThese, and none else with us shall rest!\nMe on thy loving side to press,\nThat was a heaven of blessedness!\nBut now, I cannot do it more;\nI feel as I must force my love to thee,\nAnd thou didst coldly fling me back from thee;\nAnd yet 'tis thou!--as good, as loving as before.\nFaust.\n'Tis I, even I, come, sweet love, come!\nMargaret.\nOut there?\nFaust.\nInto the open air.\nMargaret.\nIf the grave be there,\nAnd death there waits, then come!\nHence to my eternal home,\nNot a step more.--\nThou leav'st me now?--would I might go with thee?\nFaust.\nThou canst, if thou but wilt. I have unbarred the door.\nMargaret.\nI may not go; no hope for me remains;\nThey watch me close--my home is with my chains.\nIt is so sad to beg from door to door;\nA guilty thing from human loves outcast,\nA homeless earth to wander o'er;\nAnd they are sure to find me out at last.\nFaust.\nI will protect thee.\nMargaret.\nQuick! Quick!\nSave thy poor child!\nAway, away!\nKeep the path\nUp the stream,\nAcross the bridge,\nTo the left hand,\nWhere the plank stands,\nIn the pond,\nSeize it, quick!\nIt rises up,\nIt kicks! it lives!\nO save it, save it!\nFaust.\nOnly bethink thee!\nOne step more, and thou art free.\nMargaret.\nWould we were past that mountain gray!\nThere sits my mother on a stone--\nI feel a hand that pulls me back\nAs cold as clay!\nThere sits my mother on a stone;\nHer head sways heavily;\nShe winks not, she nods not, her head she may not raise.\nShe slept so long, she never more may wake.\nShe slept that we might our enjoyment take.\nO these were happy days!\nFaust.\nHere words and prayers will only make things worse;\nCome! come; or I must hale thee hence by force.\nMargaret.\nLet me alone! lay no rough hands on me!\nNor with such murderous clutches seize me!\nThou know'st I have done everything to please thee.\nFaust.\nThe day dawns. Come, my Gretchen, follow me!\nMargaret.\nDay! yes, it is day! the Judgment-day breaks in!\nMy marriage-day it should have been!\nLet no one know thou wert before with Margaret.\nWoe to my wreath!\n'Tis done! oh, pain!\nWe will meet again;\nBut not at the dance.\nThe thronging crowds advance\nWith bated breath;\nNo word is spoken;\nThe squares, the streets,\nCannot contain them all.\nThe bell doth call,\nThe staff is broken,\nThey bind me with cords, they drag me away,\nAnd on the bloody block me lay;\nAnd every trembling eye doth quake\nAt the blade that is brandished o'er my neck.\nMute lies the world as the grave!\nFaust.\nO had I ne'er been born!\nMephistopheles. [_appearing from without_]\nUp! or no help can save!\nProfitless whining, whimpering, and prating!\nMeanwhile my eager steeds are waiting,\nSnuffing the scent of the morning air.\nMargaret.\nWhat's that from the floor uprising there?\n'Tis he! 'Tis he! O send his hateful face\nAway! What seeks he in this holy place?\nHe comes for me!\nFaust.\nNo! thou shalt live.\nMargaret.\nJudgment of God! to thee my soul I give.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]\nCome, come! else will I leave you to your fate!\nMargaret.\nThine am I, Father! O shut not the gate\nOf mercy on me!\nYe angels! ye most holy Spirits! now\nEncamp around me! and protect me now!\nHenry, I tremble when I think on thee.\nMephistopheles.\nShe is judged!\nVoice.
