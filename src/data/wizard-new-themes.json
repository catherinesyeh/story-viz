Their\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\nmany miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\nanother corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar\u2014except a\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\ncrush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\nhole.\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun\nand wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes\nand left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and\nlips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled\nnow. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had\nbeen so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and\npress her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached\nher ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she\ncould find anything to laugh at.\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his\nrough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.",

The\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\nbeards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\nstiffly.\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\ncome farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low\nbow and said, in a sweet voice:\n\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the",

What could the little\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\nlittle girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,\nwith hesitation, \"You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I\nhave not killed anything.\"\n\"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the little old woman, with a laugh,\n\"and that is the same thing. See!\" she continued, pointing to the\ncorner of the house. \"There are her two feet, still sticking out from\nunder a block of wood.\"\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\n\"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\ndismay. \"The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?\"\n\"There is nothing to be done,\" said the little woman calmly.\n\"But who was she?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\" answered the little\nwoman. \"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and\nare grateful to you for the favor.\"\n\"Who are the Munchkins?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\"They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked\nWitch ruled.\"\n\"Are you a Munchkin?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.\"\n\"Oh, gracious!\" cried Dorothy. \"Are you a real witch?\"\n\"Yes, indeed,\" answered the little woman. \"But I am a good witch, and\nthe people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.\"\n\"But I thought all witches were wicked,\" said the girl, who was half\nfrightened at facing a real witch. \"Oh, no, that is a great mistake.\nThere were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,\nthose who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know\nthis is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.\nThose who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;\nbut now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch\nin all the Land of Oz\u2014the one who lives in the West.\"",

Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging\nfrom the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what\nshe wanted to help out her breakfast.\nThen she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to\na good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for\nthe journey to the City of Emeralds.\nDorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was\nhanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white\nand blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,\nit was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed\nherself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.\nShe took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,\nlaying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and\nnoticed how old and worn her shoes were.\n\"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,\" she said. And\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his\ntail to show he knew what she meant.\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.\n\"I wonder if they will fit me,\" she said to Toto. \"They would be just\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.\"\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which\nfitted her as well as if they had been made for her.\nFinally she picked up her basket.\n\"Come along, Toto,\" she said. \"We will go to the Emerald City and ask\nthe Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.\"\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket\nof her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she\nstarted on her journey.",

Then she sat upon a settee and watched the\npeople dance.\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, \"You must be a great sorceress.\"\n\"Why?\" asked the girl.\n\"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\nwear white.\"\n\"My dress is blue and white checked,\" said Dorothy, smoothing out the\nwrinkles in it.\n\"It is kind of you to wear that,\" said Boq. \"Blue is the color of the\nMunchkins, and white is the witch color.

            "text": "She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of\nyellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far\naway she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from\nthe ripe corn.\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\nnose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue\nhat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and\nthe rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,\nwhich had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots\nwith blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure\nwas raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its\nback.\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.\nShe thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the\nscarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\n\"Good day,\" said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\n\"Did you speak?\" asked the girl, in wonder.\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"How do you do?\"\n\"I'm pretty well, thank you,\" replied Dorothy politely. \"How do you\ndo?\"\n\"I'm not feeling well,\" said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \"for it is\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\"\n\"Can't you get down?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\"\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\n\"Thank you very much,\" said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on\nthe ground. \"I feel like a new man.\"\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man\nspeak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and\nyawned. \"And where are you going?\"\n\"My name is Dorothy,\" said the girl, \"and I am going to the Emerald\nCity, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\"\n\"Where is the Emerald City?\" he inquired. \"And who is Oz?\"\n\"Why, don't you know?\" she returned, in surprise.\n\"No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no\nbrains at all,\" he answered sadly.\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy, \"I'm awfully sorry for you.\"\n\"Do you think,\" he asked, \"if I go to the Emerald City with you, that\nOz would give me some brains?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" she returned, \"but you may come with me, if you like.\nIf Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\nare now.\"\n\"That is true,\" said the Scarecrow. \"You see,\" he continued\nconfidentially, \"I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin\ninto me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\"\n\"I understand how you feel,\" said the little girl, who was truly sorry\nfor him. \"If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for\nyou.\"\n\"Thank you,\" he answered gratefully.\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats\nin the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\nScarecrow.",

I was\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that\ntime is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\nwas going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\nI heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'\n\"'They aren't straight,'\" answered the other.\n\"'Never mind,'\" said the farmer. \"'They are ears just the same,'\" which\nwas true enough.\n\"'Now I'll make the eyes,'\" said the farmer. So he painted my right\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\nfirst glimpse of the world.\n\"'That's a rather pretty eye,'\" remarked the Munchkin who was watching\nthe farmer. \"'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.'\n\"'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'\" said the farmer. And\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then\nhe made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time\nI didn't know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make\nmy body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at\nlast, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as\nanyone.\n\"'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer. 'He\nlooks just like a man.'\n\"'Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\naway and left me alone.\n\"I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on\nthat pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,\nhaving been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds\nflew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away\nagain, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel\nthat I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near\nme, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and\nsaid:\n\"'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any\ncrow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.' Then he\nhopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short\ntime there was a great flock of them about me.\n\"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, 'If you only had\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.'\n\"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\"",

Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up\nagain.\n\"Why didn't you walk around the hole?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"I don't know enough,\" replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. \"My head is\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\nhim for some brains.\"\n\"Oh, I see,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"But, after all, brains are not the\nbest things in the world.\"\n\"Have you any?\" inquired the Scarecrow.\n\"No, my head is quite empty,\" answered the Woodman. \"But once I had\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\nrather have a heart.\"\n\"And why is that?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"I will tell you my story, and then you will know.\"\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\nthe following story:\n\"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\nand sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a\nwoodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\nlong as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\n\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry\nme as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for\nher; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old\nwoman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\nhousework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.\nThereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\nleft leg.\n\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I\nwas used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for\nshe had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin\ngirl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right\nleg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of\ntin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;\nbut, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked\nWitch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I\nthought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come\nalong, and he made me a new head out of tin.\n\"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\ntwo halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\n\"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There\nwas only one danger\u2014that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in\nmy cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,\nthere came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a\nrainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I\nwas left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a\nterrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time\nto think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.\nWhile I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can\nlove who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\none. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.\"\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story\nof the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a\nnew heart.\n\"All the same,\" said the Scarecrow, \"I shall ask for brains instead of\na heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\none.\"\n\"I shall take the heart,\" returned the Tin Woodman; \"for brains do not\nmake one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\"\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her\ntwo friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to\nKansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had\nno brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.",

You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very\ngood breakfast.\"\n\"Don't! Please don't,\" begged the Tin Woodman. \"I should certainly weep\nif you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.\"\nBut the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no\none ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it. And the Scarecrow\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\nas many as he put in the basket.

So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came\nnear to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep.

It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit\ntrees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for\nthe poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.\nThey walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to\npick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:\n\"Look!\"\nThen they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon\nhis pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.\n\"What can we do to save him?\" asked Dorothy.\nThe Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.\nSo they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow\nuntil a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the\nwater's edge.\n\"Who are you and where are you going?\" asked the Stork.\n\"I am Dorothy,\" answered the girl, \"and these are my friends, the Tin\nWoodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.\"\n\"This isn't the road,\" said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and\nlooked sharply at the queer party.\n\"I know it,\" returned Dorothy, \"but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are\nwondering how we shall get him again.\"\n\"Where is he?\" asked the Stork.\n\"Over there in the river,\" answered the little girl.\n\"If he wasn't so big and heavy I would get him for you,\" remarked the\nStork.\n\"He isn't heavy a bit,\" said Dorothy eagerly, \"for he is stuffed with\nstraw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever\nand ever so much.\"\n\"Well, I'll try,\" said the Stork, \"but if I find he is too heavy to\ncarry I shall have to drop him in the river again.\"\nSo the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to\nwhere the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her\ngreat claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into\nthe air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin\nWoodman and Toto were sitting.\nWhen the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so\nhappy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they\nwalked along he sang \"Tol-de-ri-de-oh!\" at every step, he felt so gay.\n\"I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,\" he said,\n\"but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find\nthe Stork again and do her some kindness in return.\"\n\"That's all right,\" said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.\n\"I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my\nbabies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald\nCity and that Oz will help you.\"\n\"Thank you,\" replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air\nand was soon out of sight.",

They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a\ncompany, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\n\"Where are you all going?\"\n\"To the Emerald City,\" said Dorothy, \"to see the Great Oz.\"\n\"Oh, indeed!\" exclaimed the man. \"Are you sure that Oz will see you?\"\n\"Why not?\" she replied.\n\"Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.\"\n\"Does he never go out?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,\nand even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.\"\n\"What is he like?\" asked the girl.\n\"That is hard to tell,\" said the man thoughtfully. \"You see, Oz is a\nGreat Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say\nhe looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a\nbrownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,\nwhen he is in his own form, no living person can tell.\"\n\"That is very strange,\" said Dorothy, \"but we must try, in some way, to\nsee him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.\"\n\"Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?\" asked the man.\n\"I want him to give me some brains,\" said the Scarecrow eagerly.\n\"Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,\" declared the man. \"He has more\nbrains than he needs.\"\n\"And I want him to give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"That will not trouble him,\" continued the man, \"for Oz has a large\ncollection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.\"\n\"And I want him to give me courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.\n\"Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,\" said the man,\n\"which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running\nover. He will be glad to give you some.\"\n\"And I want him to send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Where is Kansas?\" asked the man, with surprise.\n\"I don't know,\" replied Dorothy sorrowfully, \"but it is my home, and\nI'm sure it's somewhere.\"\n\"Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\nKansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a\nhard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he\nusually has his own way. But what do YOU want?\" he continued, speaking\nto Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not\nspeak.\nThe woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered\naround the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of\nscrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.\nThe Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it\nwas made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of\neverything, and was glad to get a good supper again.",

Even those who live in the City must wear\nspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it\nwhen the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock\nthem.\"\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in\nthem. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast\nwith the key.\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he\nwas ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a\npeg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him",

            "text": "\"Thank you,\" replied the girl; \"that is very kind of Oz.\"\nThe soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,\ndressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely\ngreen hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she\nsaid, \"Follow me and I will show you your room.\"\nSo Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the\ndog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up\nthree flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the\nPalace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft\ncomfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet\ncounterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that\nshot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a\nbeautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in\nthe windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.\nWhen Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer\ngreen pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\nIn a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and\nvelvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.\n\"Make yourself perfectly at home,\" said the green girl, \"and if you\nwish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow\nmorning.\"\nShe left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led\nto rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant\npart of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the\nScarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It\nwould not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he\nremained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web\nin a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most\nwonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from\nforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not\nbeing able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down\nto make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have\npreferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being\nshut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so\nhe sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred\nhimself asleep in a minute.\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\ngreen ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room\nof the Great Oz.\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to\ndo but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\nOz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\nwhispered:\n\"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\"\n\"Of course,\" answered the girl, \"if he will see me.\"\n\"Oh, he will see you,\" said the soldier who had taken her message to\nthe Wizard, \"although he does not like to have people ask to see him.\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\ncame from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about\nthe mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his\npresence.\"\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, \"That is the\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\"\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\nwonderful manner.\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\nDorothy heard a voice say:\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\n\"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\"\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\nvoice:\n\"Where did you get the silver shoes?\"\n\"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\nher and killed her,\" she replied.\n\"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?\" continued the voice.\n\"That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\" said the girl.\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\ntruth. Then Oz asked, \"What do you wish me to do?\"\n\"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\" she\nanswered earnestly. \"I don't like your country, although it is so\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\nbeing away so long.\"\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\n\"Why should I do this for you?\" asked Oz.\n\"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\nand I am only a little girl.\"\n\"But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,\" said\nOz.\n\"That just happened,\" returned Dorothy simply; \"I could not help it.\"\n\"Well,\" said the Head, \"I will give you my answer. You have no right to\nexpect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in\nreturn. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If\nyou wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do\nsomething for me first. Help me and I will help you.\"\n\"What must I do?\" asked the girl.\n\"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\" answered Oz.\n\"But I cannot!\" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\n\"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\nbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all\nthis land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to\nKansas\u2014but not before.\"\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\nfelt that she could help him if she would.\n\"I never killed anything, willingly,\" she sobbed. \"Even if I wanted to,\nhow could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,\ncannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?\"\n\"I do not know,\" said the Head; \"but that is my answer, and until the\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember\nthat the Witch is Wicked\u2014tremendously Wicked\u2014and ought to be killed.\nNow go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.\"",

But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of\nthe mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full\nof fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with\nher umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in\nreturn. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so\nwicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.\nDorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would\nbe harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again.

Her bees and her crows and her wolves\nwere lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of\nthe Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,\nthey would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.\nShe watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,\nthinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty\nshoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took\nher bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in\nDorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was\ngreater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy\nwas bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let\nwater touch her in any way.\nBut the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a\ntrick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in\nthe middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the\niron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the\nfloor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at\nfull length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver\nShoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched\nit away and put it on her own skinny foot.\nThe wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for\nas long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their\ncharm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how\nto do so.",

They had made a chair of their hands and\nwere careful not to hurt her.\n\"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?\" she asked.\n\"That is a long story,\" answered the King, with a winged laugh; \"but as\nwe have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you\nabout it, if you wish.\"\n\"I shall be glad to hear it,\" she replied.\n\"Once,\" began the leader, \"we were a free people, living happily in the\ngreat forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and\ndoing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some\nof us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull\nthe tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing\nnuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and\nhappy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was\nmany years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this\nland.\n\"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who\nwas also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the\npeople, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name\nwas Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great\nblocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that\nshe could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much\ntoo stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,\nhowever, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his\nyears. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she\nwould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used\nall her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any\nwoman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,\nwas said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly\nbeauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to\nmake everything ready for the wedding.\n\"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\nlived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a\njoke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my\ngrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking\nbeside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and\npurple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could\ndo. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in\ntheir arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then\ndropped him into the water.\n\"'Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, 'and see if the\nwater has spotted your clothes.' Quelala was much too wise not to swim,\nand he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.\nBut when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and\nvelvet all ruined by the river.\n\"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had\nall the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that\ntheir wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had\ntreated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded\nhard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings\ntied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette\nfinally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever\nafter do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This\nCap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to\nhave cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how\nit happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the\nGolden Cap, whosoever he may be.\"\n\"And what became of them?\" asked Dorothy, who had been greatly\ninterested in the story.\n\"Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,\" replied the Monkey,\n\"he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not\nbear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he\nhad married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never\nagain set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we\nwere all afraid of her.\n\"This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the\nhands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies,\nand afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the\nGolden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your\nwishes upon us.\"\nAs the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the\ngreen, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at\nthe rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The\nstrange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of\nthe City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away,\nfollowed by all his band.",

I'm supposed to be a Great Wizard.\"\n\"And aren't you?\" she asked.\n\"Not a bit of it, my dear; I'm just a common man.\"\n\"You're more than that,\" said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \"you're\na humbug.\"\n\"Exactly so!\" declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if\nit pleased him. \"I am a humbug.\"\n\"But this is terrible,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"How shall I ever get my\nheart?\"\n\"Or I my courage?\" asked the Lion.\n\"Or I my brains?\" wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes\nwith his coat sleeve.\n\"My dear friends,\" said Oz, \"I pray you not to speak of these little\nthings. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found\nout.\"\n\"Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No one knows it but you four\u2014and myself,\" replied Oz. \"I have fooled\neveryone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a\ngreat mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will\nnot see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.\"\n\"But, I don't understand,\" said Dorothy, in bewilderment. \"How was it\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?\"\n\"That was one of my tricks,\" answered Oz. \"Step this way, please, and I\nwill tell you all about it.\"\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and\nthey all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great\nHead, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully\npainted face.\n\"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,\" said Oz. \"I stood behind the\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.\"\n\"But how about the voice?\" she inquired.\n\"Oh, I am a ventriloquist,\" said the little man. \"I can throw the sound\nof my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of\nthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.\" He showed\nthe Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be\nthe lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was\nnothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their\nsides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also\nfrom the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was\npoured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\n\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for\nbeing such a humbug.\"\n\"I am\u2014I certainly am,\" answered the little man sorrowfully; \"but it was\nthe only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of",

I can imitate any kind of a bird or\nbeast.\" Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears\nand looked everywhere to see where she was. \"After a time,\" continued\nOz, \"I tired of that, and became a balloonist.\"\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,\" he explained.\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I know.\"\n\"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\nthat I couldn't come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\naway. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a\nstrange and beautiful country.\n\"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\n\"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\"\n\"But isn't everything here green?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No more than in any other city,\" replied Oz; \"but when you wear green\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\nthat is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and\nthey like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself\nup and would not see any of them.",
