      "text": "Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\nmany miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\nanother corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar\u2014except a\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\ncrush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\nhole.\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun\nand wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes\nand left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and\nlips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled\nnow. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had\nbeen so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and\npress her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached\nher ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she\ncould find anything to laugh at.\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his\nrough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.",

      "text": "While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,\nshe noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had\never seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\nbeards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\nstiffly.\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\ncome farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low\nbow and said, in a sweet voice:\n\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.\"\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\nlittle girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,\nwith hesitation, \"You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I\nhave not killed anything.\"\n\"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the little old woman, with a laugh,\n\"and that is the same thing. See!\" she continued, pointing to the\ncorner of the house. \"There are her two feet, still sticking out from\nunder a block of wood.\"\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\n\"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\ndismay. \"The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?\"\n\"There is nothing to be done,\" said the little woman calmly.\n\"But who was she?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\" answered the little\nwoman. \"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and\nare grateful to you for the favor.\"\n\"Who are the Munchkins?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\"They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked\nWitch ruled.\"\n\"Are you a Munchkin?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.\"",

Then she looked up and said, \"I do not\nknow where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned\nbefore. But tell me, is it a civilized country?\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Dorothy.\n\"Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there\nare no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,\nyou see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off\nfrom all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and\nwizards amongst us.\"\n\"Who are the wizards?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"Oz himself is the Great Wizard,\" answered the Witch, sinking her voice\nto a whisper. \"He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He\nlives in the City of Emeralds.\"\nDorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,\nwho had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the\ncorner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\n\"What is it?\" asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to\nlaugh.

It was gingham, with checks of white\nand blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,\nit was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed\nherself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.\nShe took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,\nlaying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and\nnoticed how old and worn her shoes were.\n\"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,\" she said. And\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his\ntail to show he knew what she meant.\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.\n\"I wonder if they will fit me,\" she said to Toto. \"They would be just\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.\"\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which\nfitted her as well as if they had been made for her.\nFinally she picked up her basket.\n\"Come along, Toto,\" she said. \"We will go to the Emerald City and ask\nthe Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.\"\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket\nof her dress.

      "text": "There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find\nthe one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking\nbriskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on\nthe hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang\nsweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a\nlittle girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own\ncountry and set down in the midst of a strange land.\nShe was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country\nwas about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted\na dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and\nvegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and\nable to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and\nthe people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for\neveryone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and\nsetting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were\nodd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.\nAll were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the\nfavorite color.\nToward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to\nwonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather\nlarger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women\nwere dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and\nthe people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was\nloaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other\ngood things to eat.\nThe people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to\npass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest\nMunchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to\ncelebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.\nDorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin\nhimself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the\npeople dance.\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, \"You must be a great sorceress.\"\n\"Why?\" asked the girl.\n\"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\nwear white.\"\n\"My dress is blue and white checked,\" said Dorothy, smoothing out the\nwrinkles in it.\n\"It is kind of you to wear that,\" said Boq. \"Blue is the color of the\nMunchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly\nwitch.\"\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to\nthink her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange\nland.\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made\nof blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with\nToto curled up on the blue rug beside her.",

      "text": "She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of\nyellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far\naway she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from\nthe ripe corn.\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\nnose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue\nhat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and\nthe rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,\nwhich had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots\nwith blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure\nwas raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its\nback.\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.\nShe thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the\nscarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\n\"Good day,\" said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\n\"Did you speak?\" asked the girl, in wonder.\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"How do you do?\"\n\"I'm pretty well, thank you,\" replied Dorothy politely. \"How do you\ndo?\"\n\"I'm not feeling well,\" said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \"for it is\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\"\n\"Can't you get down?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\"\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\n\"Thank you very much,\" said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on\nthe ground. \"I feel like a new man.\"\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man\nspeak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and\nyawned. \"And where are you going?\"\n\"My name is Dorothy,\" said the girl, \"and I am going to the Emerald\nCity, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\"\n\"Where is the Emerald City?\" he inquired. \"And who is Oz?\"\n\"Why, don't you know?\" she returned, in surprise.\n\"No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no\nbrains at all,\" he answered sadly.\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy, \"I'm awfully sorry for you.\"\n\"Do you think,\" he asked, \"if I go to the Emerald City with you, that\nOz would give me some brains?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" she returned, \"but you may come with me, if you like.\nIf Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\nare now.\"\n\"That is true,\" said the Scarecrow. \"You see,\" he continued\nconfidentially, \"I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin\ninto me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\"\n\"I understand how you feel,\" said the little girl, who was truly sorry\nfor him. \"If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for\nyou.\"\n\"Thank you,\" he answered gratefully.\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats\nin the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\nScarecrow.",

      "text": "At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy\nopened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the\nScarecrow, but he refused.\n\"I am never hungry,\" he said, \"and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my\nmouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat,\nthe straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the\nshape of my head.\"\nDorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on\neating her bread.\n\"Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,\" said\nthe Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told him all\nabout Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone\nhad carried her to this queer Land of Oz.\nThe Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, \"I cannot understand why\nyou should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry,\ngray place you call Kansas.\"\n\"That is because you have no brains\" answered the girl. \"No matter how\ndreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would\nrather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful.\nThere is no place like home.\"\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\n\"Of course I cannot understand it,\" he said. \"If your heads were\nstuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the\nbeautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is\nfortunate for Kansas that you have brains.\"\n\"Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?\" asked the child.\nThe Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\n\"My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that\ntime is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\nwas going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\nI heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'\n\"'They aren't straight,'\" answered the other.\n\"'Never mind,'\" said the farmer. \"'They are ears just the same,'\" which\nwas true enough.\n\"'Now I'll make the eyes,'\" said the farmer. So he painted my right\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\nfirst glimpse of the world.\n\"'That's a rather pretty eye,'\" remarked the Munchkin who was watching\nthe farmer. \"'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.'\n\"'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'\" said the farmer. And\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then\nhe made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time\nI didn't know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make\nmy body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at\nlast, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as\nanyone.\n\"'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer. 'He\nlooks just like a man.'\n\"'Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\naway and left me alone.\n\"I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on\nthat pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,\nhaving been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds\nflew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away\nagain, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel\nthat I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near\nme, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and\nsaid:\n\"'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any\ncrow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.' Then he\nhopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short\ntime there was a great flock of them about me.\n\"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, 'If you only had\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.'\n\"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\"",

They turned and walked through the forest a few\nsteps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine\nthat fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped\nshort, with a little cry of surprise.\nOne of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing\nbeside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely\nof tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.\nDorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while\nToto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his\nteeth.\n\"Did you groan?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"Yes,\" answered the tin man, \"I did. I've been groaning for more than a\nyear, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\"\n\"What can I do for you?\" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the\nsad voice in which the man spoke.\n\"Get an oil-can and oil my joints,\" he answered. \"They are rusted so\nbadly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.\"\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then\nshe returned and asked anxiously, \"Where are your joints?\"\n\"Oil my neck, first,\" replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as\nit was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and\nmoved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the\nman could turn it himself.\n\"Now oil the joints in my arms,\" he said. And Dorothy oiled them and\nthe Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust\nand as good as new.\nThe Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which\nhe leaned against the tree.\n\"This is a great comfort,\" he said. \"I have been holding that axe in\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at\nlast. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right\nonce more.\"\nSo they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked\nthem again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite\ncreature, and very grateful.\n\"I might have stood there always if you had not come along,\" he said;\n\"so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?\"\n\"We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,\" she\nanswered, \"and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.\"\n\"Why do you wish to see Oz?\" he asked.\n\"I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to\nput a few brains into his head,\" she replied.\nThe Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:\n\"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?\"\n\"Why, I guess so,\" Dorothy answered. \"It would be as easy as to give\nthe Scarecrow brains.\"\n\"True,\" the Tin Woodman returned. \"So, if you will allow me to join\nyour party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.\"\n\"Come along,\" said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she\nwould be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his\naxe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road\nthat was paved with yellow brick.",

But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe\nand chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire\nparty.\nDorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not\nnotice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the\nside of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up\nagain.\n\"Why didn't you walk around the hole?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"I don't know enough,\" replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. \"My head is\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\nhim for some brains.\"\n\"Oh, I see,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"But, after all, brains are not the\nbest things in the world.\"\n\"Have you any?\" inquired the Scarecrow.\n\"No, my head is quite empty,\" answered the Woodman. \"But once I had\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\nrather have a heart.\"\n\"And why is that?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"I will tell you my story, and then you will know.\"\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\nthe following story:\n\"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\nand sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a\nwoodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\nlong as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\n\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry\nme as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for\nher; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old\nwoman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\nhousework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.\nThereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\nleft leg.\n\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I\nwas used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for\nshe had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin\ngirl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right\nleg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of\ntin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;\nbut, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked\nWitch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I\nthought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come\nalong, and he made me a new head out of tin.\n\"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\ntwo halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\n\"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There\nwas only one danger\u2014that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in\nmy cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,\nthere came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a\nrainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I\nwas left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a\nterrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time\nto think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.\nWhile I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can\nlove who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\none. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.\"\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story\nof the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a\nnew heart.\n\"All the same,\" said the Scarecrow, \"I shall ask for brains instead of\na heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\none.\"\n\"I shall take the heart,\" returned the Tin Woodman; \"for brains do not\nmake one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\"\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her\ntwo friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to\nKansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had\nno brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.",

      "text": "Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and\nfull of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and\nplums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest\nthey had passed safely through, although they had suffered many\ndiscouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that\nseemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.\nTo be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.\nBut the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few\nmore logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready\nto start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in\nher arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,\nfor he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood\nupon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands\nto push the raft through the water.\nThey got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of\nthe river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and\nfarther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep\nthat the long poles would not touch the bottom.\n\"This is bad,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"for if we cannot get to the land\nwe shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,\nand she will enchant us and make us her slaves.\"\n\"And then I should get no brains,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"And I should get no courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.\n\"And I should get no heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"And I should never get back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\n\"We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,\" the Scarecrow\ncontinued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in\nthe mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out\nagain\u2014or let go\u2014the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was\nleft clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.\n\"Good-bye!\" he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave\nhim. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered\nthat he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.\nOf course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.\n\"I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,\" he thought. \"Then,\nI was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare\nthe crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow\nstuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never\nhave any brains, after all!\"\nDown the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far\nbehind. Then the Lion said:\n\"Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and\npull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my\ntail.\"\nSo he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of\nhis tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the\nshore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they\nwere drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's\nlong pole and helped push the raft to the land.\nThey were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped\noff upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had\ncarried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the\nEmerald City.\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on\nthe grass to let the sun dry him.\n\"We must get back to the road, in some way,\" said Dorothy.\n\"The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the\nroad again,\" remarked the Lion.\nSo, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they\nstarted along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had\ncarried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit\ntrees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for\nthe poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.",

There were big yellow and white and\nblue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,\nwhich were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy's eyes.\n\"Aren't they beautiful?\" the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy\nscent of the bright flowers.\n\"I suppose so,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"When I have brains, I shall\nprobably like them better.\"\n\"If I only had a heart, I should love them,\" added the Tin Woodman.\n\"I always did like flowers,\" said the Lion. \"They seem so helpless and\nfrail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.\"\nThey now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer\nand fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the\nmidst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when\nthere are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that\nanyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried\naway from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But\nDorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red\nflowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy\nand she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.\nBut the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.\n\"We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,\"\nhe said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until\nDorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and\nshe forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.\n\"What shall we do?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"If we leave her here she will die,\" said the Lion. \"The smell of the\nflowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and\nthe dog is asleep already.\"\nIt was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not\ntroubled by the scent of the flowers.\n\"Run fast,\" said the Scarecrow to the Lion, \"and get out of this deadly\nflower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,\nbut if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.\"\nSo the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.\nIn a moment he was out of sight.\n\"Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,\" said the Scarecrow.\nSo they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they\nmade a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms\nand carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\nOn and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly\nflowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of\nthe river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast\nasleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge\nbeast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance\nfrom the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in\nbeautiful green fields before them.\n\"We can do nothing for him,\" said the Tin Woodman, sadly; \"for he is\nmuch too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and\nperhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the Scarecrow. \"The Lion was a very good comrade for\none so cowardly. But let us go on.\"\nThey carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far\nenough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the\npoison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass",

It was, indeed, a great\nyellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,\nfor its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,\nshowing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of\nfire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the\nbeast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he\nknew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,\nharmless creature.\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a\nquick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\n\"Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.\"\n\"Don't speak of it, I beg of you,\" replied the Woodman. \"I have no\nheart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a\nfriend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.\"\n\"Only a mouse!\" cried the little animal, indignantly. \"Why, I am a\nQueen\u2014the Queen of all the Field Mice!\"\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said the Woodman, making a bow.\n\"Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\nsaving my life,\" added the Queen.\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\nexclaimed:\n\"Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage\nto escape the great Wildcat?\" They all bowed so low to the little Queen\nthat they almost stood upon their heads.\n\"This funny tin man,\" she answered, \"killed the Wildcat and saved my\nlife. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest\nwish.\"\n\"We will!\" cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they\nscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and\nseeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped\nright into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice\nwhen he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.\nBut the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,\nwhile he called to the mice, \"Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt",

The people were all dressed in\nclothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like\nthose of the Munchkins.\n\"This must be the Land of Oz,\" said Dorothy, \"and we are surely getting\nnear the Emerald City.\"\n\"Yes,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"Everything is green here, while in the\ncountry of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do\nnot seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I'm afraid we shall be\nunable to find a place to pass the night.\"\n\"I should like something to eat besides fruit,\" said the girl, \"and I'm\nsure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to\nthe people.\"\nSo, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up\nto the door and knocked.\nA woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, \"What do you\nwant, child, and why is that great Lion with you?\"\n\"We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,\" answered\nDorothy; \"and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you\nfor the world.\"\n\"Is he tame?\" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the girl, \"and he is a great coward, too. He will be\nmore afraid of you than you are of him.\"\n\"Well,\" said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep\nat the Lion, \"if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you\nsome supper and a place to sleep.\"\nSo they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two\nchildren and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the\ncouch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a\ncompany, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\n\"Where are you all going?\"\n\"To the Emerald City,\" said Dorothy, \"to see the Great Oz.\"\n\"Oh, indeed!\" exclaimed the man. \"Are you sure that Oz will see you?\"\n\"Why not?\" she replied.\n\"Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.\"\n\"Does he never go out?\" asked the Scarecrow.",

Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\nKansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a\nhard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he\nusually has his own way. But what do YOU want?\" he continued, speaking\nto Toto.

The\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of\neverything, and was glad to get a good supper again.\nThe woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside\nher, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be\ndisturbed.

Yet it\nwas afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the\nCity. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big\ngate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even\nthe painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and\nheard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly\nopen, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched\nroom, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He\nwas clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin\nwas of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, \"What do you wish\nin the Emerald City?\"\n\"We came here to see the Great Oz,\" said Dorothy.\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\nover.\n\"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,\" he said,\nshaking his head in perplexity. \"He is powerful and terrible, and if\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.\"\n\"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,\" replied the\nScarecrow; \"it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\nWizard.\"\n\"So he is,\" said the green man, \"and he rules the Emerald City wisely\nand well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his\nface. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the\nGreat Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the\nspectacles.\"\n\"Why?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the\nEmerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear\nspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it\nwhen the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock\nthem.\"\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in\nthem. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast\nwith the key.\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he\nwas ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a\npeg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him",

      "text": "The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\ngreen ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room\nof the Great Oz.\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to\ndo but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\nOz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\nwhispered:\n\"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\"\n\"Of course,\" answered the girl, \"if he will see me.\"\n\"Oh, he will see you,\" said the soldier who had taken her message to\nthe Wizard, \"although he does not like to have people ask to see him.\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\ncame from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about\nthe mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his\npresence.\"\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, \"That is the\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\"\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\nwonderful manner.\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\nDorothy heard a voice say:\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\n\"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\"\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\nvoice:\n\"Where did you get the silver shoes?\"\n\"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\nher and killed her,\" she replied.\n\"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?\" continued the voice.\n\"That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\" said the girl.\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\ntruth. Then Oz asked, \"What do you wish me to do?\"\n\"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\" she\nanswered earnestly. \"I don't like your country, although it is so\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\nbeing away so long.\"\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\n\"Why should I do this for you?\" asked Oz.\n\"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\nand I am only a little girl.\"\n\"But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,\" said\nOz.\n\"That just happened,\" returned Dorothy simply; \"I could not help it.\"\n\"Well,\" said the Head, \"I will give you my answer. You have no right to\nexpect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in\nreturn. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If\nyou wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do\nsomething for me first. Help me and I will help you.\"\n\"What must I do?\" asked the girl.\n\"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\" answered Oz.\n\"But I cannot!\" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\n\"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\nbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all\nthis land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to\nKansas\u2014but not before.\"\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\nfelt that she could help him if she would.\n\"I never killed anything, willingly,\" she sobbed. \"Even if I wanted to,\nhow could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,\ncannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?\"\n\"I do not know,\" said the Head; \"but that is my answer, and until the\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember\nthat the Witch is Wicked\u2014tremendously Wicked\u2014and ought to be killed.\nNow go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.\"",

Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\nAnd the Lion answered, \"I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I\ncame to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may\nbecome the King of Beasts, as men call me.\"\n\"Why should I give you courage?\" demanded Oz.\n\"Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to\ngrant my request,\" answered the Lion.\nThe Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, \"Bring\nme proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you\ncourage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.\"\nThe Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and\nwhile he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so\nfuriously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad\nto find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible\ninterview with the Wizard.",

It was much harder to\nfind their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow\ndaisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go\nstraight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right\nway. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know\nwhich was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were\nlost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night\nthe moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet\nsmelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning\u2014all but the\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman.\nThe next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if\nthey were quite sure which way they were going.\n\"If we walk far enough,\" said Dorothy, \"I am sure we shall sometime\ncome to some place.\"\nBut day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but\nthe scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.\n\"We have surely lost our way,\" he said, \"and unless we find it again in\ntime to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.\"\n\"Nor I my heart,\" declared the Tin Woodman. \"It seems to me I can\nscarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long\njourney.\"\n\"You see,\" said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, \"I haven't the\ncourage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.\"\nThen Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her\ncompanions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that\nfor the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly\nthat flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked\nat Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.\n\"Suppose we call the field mice,\" she suggested. \"They could probably\ntell us the way to the Emerald City.\"\n\"To be sure they could,\" cried the Scarecrow. \"Why didn't we think of\nthat before?\"\nDorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck\nsince the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they\nheard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came\nrunning up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her\nsqueaky little voice:\n\"What can I do for my friends?\"\n\"We have lost our way,\" said Dorothy. \"Can you tell us where the\nEmerald City is?\"\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Queen; \"but it is a great way off, for you\nhave had it at your backs all this time.\" Then she noticed Dorothy's\nGolden Cap, and said, \"Why don't you use the charm of the Cap, and call\nthe Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in\nless than an hour.\"\n\"I didn't know there was a charm,\" answered Dorothy, in surprise. \"What\nis it?\"\n\"It is written inside the Golden Cap,\" replied the Queen of the Mice.\n\"But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for\nthey are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.\"\n\"Won't they hurt me?\" asked the girl anxiously.\n\"Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!\" And she\nscampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.\nDorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon\nthe lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the\ndirections carefully and put the Cap upon her head.\n\"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!\" she said, standing on her left foot.\n\"What did you say?\" asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was\ndoing.\n\"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!\" Dorothy went on, standing this time on her\nright foot.\n\"Hello!\" replied the Tin Woodman calmly.\n\"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\" said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.\nThis ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering\nand flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.\nThe King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, \"What is your command?\"\n\"We wish to go to the Emerald City,\" said the child, \"and we have lost\nour way.\"\n\"We will carry you,\" replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than\ntwo of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.\nOthers took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little\nMonkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to\nbite him.\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for\nthey remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;\nbut they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air\nquite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and\nwoods far below them.",

It was a\ngreat mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will\nnot see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.\"\n\"But, I don't understand,\" said Dorothy, in bewilderment. \"How was it\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?\"\n\"That was one of my tricks,\" answered Oz. \"Step this way, please, and I\nwill tell you all about it.\"\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and\nthey all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great\nHead, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully\npainted face.\n\"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,\" said Oz. \"I stood behind the\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.\"\n\"But how about the voice?\" she inquired.\n\"Oh, I am a ventriloquist,\" said the little man. \"I can throw the sound\nof my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of\nthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.\" He showed\nthe Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be\nthe lovely Lady.

As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also\nfrom the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was\npoured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\n\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for\nbeing such a humbug.\"\n\"I am\u2014I certainly am,\" answered the little man sorrowfully; \"but it was\nthe only thing I could do.

I can imitate any kind of a bird or\nbeast.\" Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears\nand looked everywhere to see where she was. \"After a time,\" continued\nOz, \"I tired of that, and became a balloonist.\"\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,\" he explained.\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I know.\"\n\"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\nthat I couldn't come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\naway. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a\nstrange and beautiful country.\n\"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\n\"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\"\n\"But isn't everything here green?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No more than in any other city,\" replied Oz; \"but when you wear green\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\nthat is needed to make one happy.

There were four of them in this country, and they\nruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.\nFortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew\nthey would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were\nterribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they\nthemselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in\ndeadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I\nwas when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.\nWhen you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would\nonly do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I\nam ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.\"\n\"I think you are a very bad man,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man, but I'm a very bad\nWizard, I must admit.\"\n\"Can't you give me brains?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"You don't need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has\nbrains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing that\nbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience\nyou are sure to get.\"\n\"That may all be true,\" said the Scarecrow, \"but I shall be very\nunhappy unless you give me brains.\"\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\n\"Well,\" he said with a sigh, \"I'm not much of a magician, as I said;\nbut if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head\nwith brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find\nthat out for yourself.\"\n\"Oh, thank you\u2014thank you!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"I'll find a way to use\nthem, never fear!\"\n\"But how about my courage?\" asked the Lion anxiously.\n\"You have plenty of courage, I am sure,\" answered Oz. \"All you need is\nconfidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid\nwhen it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are\nafraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.\"\n\"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same,\" said the Lion. \"I shall\nreally be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that\nmakes one forget he is afraid.\"\n\"Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,\" replied Oz.\n\"How about my heart?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"Why, as for that,\" answered Oz, \"I think you are wrong to want a\nheart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in\nluck not to have a heart.\"\n\"That must be a matter of opinion,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"For my part,\nI will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me\nthe heart.\"\n\"Very well,\" answered Oz meekly. \"Come to me tomorrow and you shall\nhave a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well\ncontinue the part a little longer.\"\n\"And now,\" said Dorothy, \"how am I to get back to Kansas?\"\n\"We shall have to think about that,\" replied the little man. \"Give me\ntwo or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a way to\ncarry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as\nmy guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon\nyou and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in\nreturn for my help\u2014such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no\none I am a humbug.\"\nThey agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to\ntheir rooms in high spirits.

But the first thing to do is to cross the\ndesert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.\"\n\"How can I cross the desert?\" she inquired.\n\"Well, I'll tell you what I think,\" said the little man. \"You see, when\nI came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the\nair, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get\nacross the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my\npowers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over, and I\nbelieve I can make a balloon.\"\n\"How?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"A balloon,\" said Oz, \"is made of silk, which is coated with glue to\nkeep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be\nno trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas\nto fill the balloon with, to make it float.\"\n\"If it won't float,\" remarked Dorothy, \"it will be of no use to us.\"\n\"True,\" answered Oz. \"But there is another way to make it float, which\nis to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn't as good as gas, for if the\nair should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we\nshould be lost.\"\n\"We!\" exclaimed the girl. \"Are you going with me?\"\n\"Yes, of course,\" replied Oz. \"I am tired of being such a humbug. If I\nshould go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a\nWizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.\nSo I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.\nI'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.\"\n\"I shall be glad to have your company,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Thank you,\" he answered. \"Now, if you will help me sew the silk\ntogether, we will begin to work on our balloon.\"",

The Tin Woodman had chopped a\nbig pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom\nof the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it\nwould be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out\nand rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the\nground.\nThen Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:\n\"I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow\nwill rule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.\"\nThe balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to\nthe ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much\nlighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into\nthe sky.\n\"Come, Dorothy!\" cried the Wizard. \"Hurry up, or the balloon will fly\naway.\"\n\"I can't find Toto anywhere,\" replied Dorothy, who did not wish to\nleave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a\nkitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran\ntowards the balloon.\nShe was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to\nhelp her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon\nrose into the air without her.\n\"Come back!\" she screamed. \"I want to go, too!\"\n\"I can't come back, my dear,\" called Oz from the basket. \"Good-bye!\"\n\"Good-bye!\" shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where\nthe Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and\nfarther into the sky.",

Finally he said:\n\"Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the\ndesert?\"\n\"I never thought of that!\" said Dorothy joyfully. \"It's just the thing.\nI'll go at once for the Golden Cap.\"\nWhen she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and\nsoon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and\nstood beside her.\n\"This is the second time you have called us,\" said the Monkey King,\nbowing before the little girl. \"What do you wish?\"\n\"I want you to fly with me to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\nBut the Monkey King shook his head.\n\"That cannot be done,\" he said. \"We belong to this country alone, and\ncannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,\nand I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there. We\nshall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross\nthe desert. Good-bye.\"\nAnd with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away\nthrough the window, followed by all his band.\nDorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. \"I have wasted the charm\nof the Golden Cap to no purpose,\" she said, \"for the Winged Monkeys\ncannot help me.\"\n\"It is certainly too bad!\" said the tender-hearted Woodman.\nThe Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly\nthat Dorothy feared it would burst.\n\"Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,\" he said, \"and ask\nhis advice.\"\nSo the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for\nwhile Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.\n\"This little girl,\" said the Scarecrow to the soldier, \"wishes to cross\nthe desert. How can she do so?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" answered the soldier, \"for nobody has ever crossed the\ndesert, unless it is Oz himself.\"\n\"Is there no one who can help me?\" asked Dorothy earnestly.\n\"Glinda might,\" he suggested.\n\"Who is Glinda?\" inquired the Scarecrow.\n\"The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,\nand rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of\nthe desert, so she may know a way to cross it.\"\n\"Glinda is a Good Witch, isn't she?\" asked the child.\n\"The Quadlings think she is good,\" said the soldier, \"and she is kind\nto everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows\nhow to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.\"\n\"How can I get to her castle?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"The road is straight to the South,\" he answered, \"but it is said to be\nfull of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a\nrace of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For\nthis reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.\"\nThe soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:\n\"It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is\nto travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of\ncourse, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.\"\n\"You must have been thinking again,\" remarked the Tin Woodman.\n\"I have,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"I shall go with Dorothy,\" declared the Lion, \"for I am tired of your\ncity and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild\nbeast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.\"\n\"That is true,\" agreed the Woodman. \"My axe may be of service to her;\nso I also will go with her to the Land of the South.\"\n\"When shall we start?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"Are you going?\" they asked, in surprise.\n\"Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never have had brains.\nShe lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\nEmerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never\nleave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said Dorothy gratefully. \"You are all very kind to me. But\nI should like to start as soon as possible.\"\n\"We shall go tomorrow morning,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"So now let us\nall get ready, for it will be a long journey.\"",

Won't you let\nme carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em's mantel?

They had nearly reached the\nfirst rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, \"Keep back!\"\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Scarecrow.\nThen a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, \"This\nhill belongs to us, and we don't allow anyone to cross it.\"\n\"But we must cross it,\" said the Scarecrow. \"We're going to the country\nof the Quadlings.\"\n\"But you shall not!\" replied the voice, and there stepped from behind\nthe rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.\nHe was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the\ntop and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms\nat all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a\ncreature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, \"I'm\nsorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether\nyou like it or not,\" and he walked boldly forward.\nAs quick as lightning the man's head shot forward and his neck\nstretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the\nScarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the\nhill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and\nthe man laughed harshly as he said, \"It isn't as easy as you think!\"\nA chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy\nsaw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind\nevery rock.\nThe Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow's\nmishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up\nthe hill.\nAgain a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the\nhill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.\nDorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion\ncame up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, \"It is\nuseless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand\nthem.\"\n\"What can we do, then?\" she asked.\n\"Call the Winged Monkeys,\" suggested the Tin Woodman. \"You have still\nthe right to command them once more.\"\n\"Very well,\" she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered\nthe magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few\nmoments the entire band stood before her.\n\"What are your commands?\" inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.\n\"Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,\" answered the\ngirl.\n\"It shall be done,\" said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys\ncaught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with\nthem. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with\nvexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not\nreach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely\nover the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the\nQuadlings.",
