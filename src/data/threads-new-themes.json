The threads seemed alive, writhing in her\nfingers as though guiding her. She paused, staring at the fabric taking shape\nbefore her, the colors blending in ways she had not intended. Her heart raced\nas her fingers followed the threads' pull, creating patterns that whispered of\nsomething more\u2014something far beyond her understanding.\nHer curiosity grew as the hours slipped by unnoticed. The tapestry was larger\nthan any she had woven before, intricate patterns intertwining, hinting at\nstories she could not fully grasp. She felt a pull deep in her chest, an\ninstinct to keep weaving, to let the threads lead her where they wished. Yet a\nsmall part of her was frightened\u2014she had never heard of such a thing happening\nto a weaver. Magic was a rarity, something spoken of only in the old tales.\nCould this be the first signs of it within her?",

She wasn't sure.\n\"Elara!\" A voice cut through her thoughts, and she turned to see Tomis, her\nchildhood friend, approaching with a wide grin. He was tall and\nbroad-shouldered, his hands calloused from years of working the fields. \"You\nlook lost in thought. Something on your mind?\"\nElara forced a smile, shaking her head. \"Just thinking about my work.\"\nTomis chuckled. \"You and your tapestries. I swear, one day you'll weave\nsomething so grand that even the king will want it.\"\nElara's smile faltered. If only he knew. \"Maybe,\" she replied, trying to sound\nlighthearted. \"But for now, I'll settle for selling enough to keep me fed.\"\nTomis eyed her for a moment, his smile fading. \"You know, Elara, you've been\ndifferent lately.

Edric,\nseemingly unfazed by the oddity, nodded and poured the drink.\nElara kept her gaze down, but she couldn't help the prickle of curiosity\ncreeping up her spine. She wasn't the only one who noticed him. Conversations\nresumed, but she saw how the regulars stole glances at the stranger, their\nwhispers hushed and cautious. It wasn't often that outsiders passed through\ntheir quiet village, especially ones with such an air of mystery.\nThe stranger didn't linger at the bar. With his drink in hand, he scanned the\nroom before settling in the darkest corner of the tavern, away from the fire\nand the warmth of the crowd. Elara tried to ignore him, focusing instead on the\ncrackling fire before her, but her mind kept drifting back to him. Who was he?\nAnd why did he seem to bring a shadow into the room with him?\nAfter a while, she finished her drink and stood to leave, but as she passed the\ntable where the stranger sat, she felt his gaze on her.

His face was still\npartially obscured, but up close, she could see the sharpness of his features,\nthe shadow of stubble along his jaw, and the cold, calculating look in his eyes.\n\"Elara, the weaver,\" he said, his voice low but carrying a strange, undeniable\nauthority.\nElara's heart raced. \"That's me,\" she said cautiously, gripping the doorframe\nto steady herself. \"Who are you?\"\n\"That's not important,\" he replied, stepping past her into the cottage as\nthough he owned the place. Elara's skin prickled at his intrusion, but before\nshe could protest, he turned to face her, his eyes glinting in the morning\nlight. \"What's important is what I need you to do.\"\nShe swallowed hard, glancing toward the loom in the corner of the room. \"And\nwhat might that be?\"\n\"I need you to weave something for me,\" the man said, his voice as smooth as\nsilk but laced with something darker. He reached into his cloak and pulled out\na small pouch, tossing it onto her worktable. The sound of clinking coins\nechoed through the cottage, the weight of the gold unmistakable.\n\"I don't just weave for anyone,\" Elara replied, crossing her arms over her\nchest, trying to maintain some semblance of control. \"What are you asking me to\nmake?\"\nThe man's gaze drifted toward the loom, then back to her. \"I need you to weave\nthe future.\"\nElara blinked, sure she had misheard him. \"The future?\" she repeated,\nincredulous. \"You can't be serious.\"\n\"I am,\" he said, his tone never wavering. \"I've heard of your... talents. I\nknow you can see things in the threads\u2014things no ordinary weaver can. I need\nyou to weave a tapestry that shows what is to come.\"\nElara's breath caught in her throat. How could he know about her visions? She\nhad told no one, not even her grandmother, about the strange things she had\nwoven recently. Her thoughts raced as she considered her options. Refusing him\ndidn't seem wise, but agreeing to such a task felt dangerous, like meddling\nwith forces she barely understood.\n\"What exactly do you want to see?\" she asked cautiously.\n\"The fate of a village,\" he replied. \"One not far from here. Glenth, I believe\nit's called.\"\nElara's blood ran cold at the name. Glenth was a neighboring village, just over\nthe hills, a place she had visited only once. \"Why Glenth?\"\n\"That's none of your concern,\" the man said, his voice hardening. \"Do we have a\ndeal or not?\"\nElara hesitated, her eyes flicking between the man and the gold on her table.\nShe knew this was a terrible idea\u2014knew that whatever power had awakened in her\nwas not meant to be used this way. But the lure of the unknown, the possibility\nof discovering more about her abilities, was too strong to resist.\n\"We have a deal,\" she whispered.",

Not really.\nNow, standing here, watching the chaos unfold, she felt an overwhelming sense\nof dread. This wasn't just a vision, a glimpse of what might be. This was real.\nThe future she had woven had come to pass, and she had no idea how to stop\nit\u2014or if it could even be stopped.\nThe villagers ran past her, shouting for help, carrying what little they could\nsalvage from their homes. The heat of the flames licked at her skin, but she\nremained frozen, unable to tear her eyes away from the devastation. The\nman\u2014Iskra, as he had finally introduced himself\u2014was nowhere to be seen, but she\nknew he was watching from somewhere, hidden in the shadows as his plan unfolded.\nHer mind raced, trying to make sense of it all. Had this been his goal all\nalong? To destroy Glenth? Why? And why had he chosen her to help him do it?\n\"Elara!\" A voice shouted her name, and she turned to see one of the villagers\nrunning toward her, panic in his eyes. \"Please, you have to help us!\"\nShe shook her head, backing away. \"I\u2014I can't,\" she stammered, the words\ncatching in her throat. \"I didn't mean for this to happen.\"\nThe man grabbed her arm, his grip tight, desperation in his voice. \"You're a\nweaver, aren't you? Can't you do something?\"\n\"I... I don't know,\" she whispered, her heart pounding in her chest. The power\nthat had seemed so wondrous, so full of possibility, now felt like a curse. She\nhad woven this destruction, and now she was powerless to stop it.\nThe flames roared louder, and the man released her, running back toward the\nvillage. Elara stood there, her chest heaving with guilt and fear. She had\nnever felt so small, so insignificant. What had she done? And more importantly,\nwhat would she do next?\nAs the village of Glenth burned, Elara turned and fled into the night, her mind",

Elara sat by the hearth, her hands clenched in\nher lap, staring into the flames. She had not woven since the fire in Glenth.\nThe memory of it still haunted her, filling her with a gnawing guilt she\ncouldn't shake. Her hands had been the ones to create that tapestry, to bring\nabout that destruction, even if she hadn't fully understood what she was doing.\nNow, the loom seemed like a thing of menace, its threads fraught with danger.\nThe door creaked open, and Elara looked up to see her grandmother stepping\ninside, carrying a basket of herbs from the garden. Grandmother Nira set the\nbasket down and gave Elara a long, searching look. \"You've been brooding too\nmuch, child,\" she said, her voice soft but firm. \"Sitting by the fire won't\nchange anything.\"\nElara sighed, dropping her gaze to her hands. \"What else can I do? I brought\nruin to Glenth. I... I didn't mean to, but it happened because of me.\"\nNira's eyes softened, though her expression remained grave. \"Fate is a delicate\nthing, Elara. It's not something that can be controlled easily, even by those\nwho have the gift.\"\nElara's head snapped up, her heart thudding in her chest. \"Gift?\" she repeated,\nincredulous. \"This doesn't feel like a gift. It feels like a curse.\"\nNira crossed the room and sat beside her, her hands clasped tightly in her lap.\n\"That's because you don't yet understand it. You're still learning, and you're\nfrightened, as you should be. But our family has always had this gift\u2014the\nability to weave fate into the fabric of the world.\"\nElara blinked, her mind reeling from her grandmother's words. \"Our family?\"\nNira nodded slowly, her expression solemn. \"For generations, the women in our\nfamily have been fate-weavers. It's why I've kept you so close, why I've taught\nyou the old ways. You're not the first to have seen things in the threads. But\nyou are the first in a long time to be able to truly shape them.\"\nElara's throat tightened. \"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\"\nNira's eyes flickered with something that looked like regret. \"I had hoped...\nyou wouldn't need to know. I had hoped the gift would remain dormant in you.\nBut now that it's awakened, you need to be careful, Elara. The power to weave\nfate is dangerous, not just to others but to yourself as well.\"\nThe weight of her grandmother's words settled heavily on Elara's shoulders. She\nhad always known there was something special about her family's weaving,\nsomething that set them apart from the other seamstresses in the village. But\nto learn that they had been manipulating fate, shaping the destinies of\nothers\u2014it was almost too much to comprehend.",

But\nnow, her hands were stained with the weight of fate, and she didn't know how to\nfree herself from it.\nHer mind drifted back to Glenth\u2014the fire, the destruction, the cries of the\nvillagers as they fled their homes. It had all happened exactly as she had seen\nit in her tapestry. How could she have known? How could she have stopped it? A\npart of her wished she had never touched that loom, never discovered the\nstrange power lurking within the threads.\nBut another part of her\u2014a quiet, insistent part\u2014wondered if there was a way to\nuse this power for good. Could she shape the threads in a way that helped\npeople, that brought about positive change instead of ruin?\nThe sound of rustling leaves drew her attention, and Elara looked up to see a\ndeer emerging from the trees. It stood at the edge of the clearing, its dark\neyes fixed on her. For a moment, they simply watched each other in silence.\nThen, without warning, the deer darted back into the forest, vanishing among\nthe shadows.\nElara exhaled slowly, her heart still pounding in her chest. She didn't have\nall the answers\u2014not yet\u2014but she knew one thing for certain: she couldn't ignore\nthis gift. It was part of her now, whether she liked it or not. And if she\ndidn't learn how to control it, it could destroy her\u2014and everything she cared\nabout.",

Her thoughts were\nclearer now, though the weight of her newfound responsibility still pressed\nheavily on her. She had spent the day reflecting at the shrine, trying to come\nto terms with everything her grandmother had revealed. But there was still so\nmuch she didn't know, so much she didn't understand.\nWhen she pushed open the door, she was greeted by the sight of her younger\nsister, Lysa, sitting at the table, her small hands working diligently at a\nsimple piece of embroidery. Lysa looked up and smiled brightly when she saw\nElara, her innocent face full of warmth and curiosity. \"Elara! I was wondering\nwhen you'd come back.\"\nElara forced a smile and sat down across from her sister. \"What are you working\non?\" she asked, though her mind was still elsewhere.\n\"Just a flower,\" Lysa said, holding up the fabric to show her. \"I wanted to\nmake something pretty to give to Grandmother.\"\nElara nodded, her heart aching at the simplicity of it all. Lysa had no idea of\nthe burden their family carried, no idea of the power that ran through their\nbloodline. Elara wanted to protect her from it, to shield her from the weight\nof fate, but she knew it was only a matter of time before Lysa started asking\nquestions.\n\"Can you show me how to do that fancy stitch you use on your tapestries?\" Lysa\nasked, her wide eyes filled with admiration.\nElara hesitated, her fingers twitching as memories of the loom flooded back.\nShe didn't want Lysa to become entangled in the same web of fate that she was.\nBut she also couldn't bear to refuse her sister's request. \"Maybe another\ntime,\" she said softly. \"It's... a little more complicated than what you're\nused to.\"\nLysa's face fell, but she nodded in understanding. \"Okay,\" she said quietly,\nreturning to her embroidery. \"But someday, I want to make something as\nbeautiful as your tapestries.\"\nElara swallowed the lump in her throat, guilt washing over her. Her\ntapestries\u2014once a source of pride\u2014now felt like a dangerous tool, capable of\nshaping destinies in ways she could barely comprehend. \"Maybe someday,\" she\nwhispered, though she wasn't sure if that was a promise she could keep.",

Didn't want to curse us with your magic? You should have\nleft well enough alone, Elara. But now... now it's too late.\"\nElara took a step back, her heart pounding in her chest. She could feel the\nanger radiating from Rurik, the distrust that had taken root in his heart. And\nshe knew, deep down, that he wasn't the only one who felt this way.\nBefore she could respond, Rurik turned and stormed off, his heavy footsteps\nechoing in the quiet field. Elara stood there, her hands trembling at her\nsides, her mind racing. She had no answers, no solutions. All she had was the\nterrible knowledge that something had gone horribly wrong\u2014and she was powerless\nto stop it.",

She hadn't woven in days, afraid of what might happen if she\ndid, afraid of what she might see in the patterns. But the silence in her\ncottage had become unbearable. Her fingers itched for the rhythm of the\nshuttle, the simple act of creation. Perhaps, she thought, if she started\nsmall, if she focused on weaving something mundane, she could avoid the dangers\nthat had come with her recent work.\nShe took a deep breath, her hands moving hesitantly at first, then more surely\nas the familiar motions returned. The threads seemed normal\u2014nothing strange, no\nsense of fate guiding her hands, just the usual flow of wool and linen. But\neven as she worked, she couldn't help but wonder if the power was still lurking\nthere, beneath the surface, waiting to spring into action.\nHours passed, the sunlight dimming as the day slipped into evening. Elara had\nnearly finished a simple tapestry\u2014a scene of the village with its bustling\nsquare and peaceful fields in the distance\u2014when she felt a subtle shift in the\nair. The loom thrummed beneath her fingers, the threads tightening, pulling her\nhands in a direction she hadn't intended. Her breath caught, but this time, she\ndidn't stop. She let the loom guide her, trusting the process, allowing the\nthreads to weave whatever story they had to tell.\nSlowly, a new image began to take shape\u2014a cluster of villagers in the square,\ntheir faces turned toward one another in quiet conversation. But there was\nsomething different about the scene. Elara's fingers moved with a strange\ncertainty, adding tiny, subtle changes to the threads\u2014an arm brushing against\nanother, a smile exchanged between two neighbors. It was as if she were weaving\nnot just the present, but something more, a gentle nudge that seemed to steer\nthe interactions in a specific direction.\nShe stepped back, her heart pounding in her chest. The tapestry was small,\nnothing grand, but it felt... different. As though she had woven more than just\na picture. She had woven possibility. She had woven change. And though she\ncouldn't be sure, she felt a quiet sense of hope stir within her, a small\nglimmer of possibility that maybe, just maybe, she could use this power for\ngood.",

People were talking again,\ntheir voices softer, less sharp. There were still whispers\u2014still fear\u2014but\nsomething had shifted.\nAs she made her way through the square, she caught sight of Jarek, a local\nmerchant, standing at his stall. Normally, Jarek was gruff and quick-tempered,\nalways bickering with his neighbor over the placement of their stalls. But\ntoday, as Elara approached, she noticed a subtle change in his demeanor. He was\ntalking to his neighbor\u2014talking, not arguing. The usual scowl that marred his\nface was gone, replaced by a look of quiet relief.\nElara's heart skipped a beat. Could this be the result of her weaving? She\nhadn't meant to target anyone specifically, but she had woven small changes,\nsubtle nudges in the fabric of the village's daily life. And now, it seemed,\nthose changes were taking root.\n\"Morning, Elara,\" Jarek called, his tone friendlier than usual. \"Care for some\napples? They're fresh from the orchard.\"\nElara smiled, nodding as she accepted the offer. \"Thank you, Jarek.\"\nHe chuckled softly, wiping his hands on his apron. \"You know, it's funny. I was\njust thinking\u2014things have been a little easier around here lately. Not as much\nbickering, not as much tension. Feels like things are... smoothing out.\"\nElara's smile faltered slightly. \"I'm glad to hear that,\" she said, though her\nmind was racing. She hadn't intended to change the village in any noticeable\nway\u2014only small adjustments, tiny shifts. But it seemed the effects were more\nprofound than she had anticipated.",

But they were just stories, passed down through generations.\nShe had never imagined they were real, let alone that they would come looking\nfor her.\n\"What do you want with me?\" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.\nMaelis stepped closer, his gaze never wavering. \"You've been weaving fate,\nhaven't you?\" he said softly, though there was no judgment in his tone, only\ncuriosity. \"The things you've done\u2014both intentional and unintentional\u2014have not\ngone unnoticed.

The idea that she had been observed, that her actions\nhad been tracked, sent a wave of fear through her. \"I never meant to\u2014\"\n\"It doesn't matter what you meant,\" Maelis interrupted, his voice calm but\nfirm. \"What matters is what you can do.

She had\ncome to the shrine again, hoping that the quiet would help her think, would\ngive her some clarity about what she should do. The trees loomed around her,\ntheir branches forming a canopy that blocked out much of the sky, casting the\nforest in a muted, green light.\nAs she neared the shrine, she felt the familiar sense of peace wash over her,\nthe weight of her worries lifting slightly. But this time, the peace didn't\nlast long. Maelis's words echoed in her mind, the threat of the guild hanging\nover her like a dark cloud. She couldn't shake the feeling that no matter what\nshe chose, it would change everything.\nShe knelt before the shrine, her hands resting on the cool stone as she closed\nher eyes and let her thoughts drift. What would it mean to join the guild?\nCould she trust them? Could she trust herself with the power they promised to\ngive her? And if she refused, what consequences would she face?\nA rustling sound in the underbrush startled her, and she opened her eyes to see\na figure emerging from the shadows. Maelis stood at the edge of the clearing,\nwatching her with an unreadable expression. \"You're thinking about it, aren't\nyou?\" he said, his voice low and smooth.\nElara stood, her heart pounding in her chest. \"You followed me.\"\nMaelis smiled, though there was no humor in it. \"I'm not here to pressure you,\nElara. I'm here to remind you of the reality you face. The guild can offer you\na way to control your gift, to use it for more than just small changes in a\nvillage square. You could shape the world.\"\nElara's jaw tightened. \"But at what cost?\"\nMaelis's eyes darkened. \"Every choice has a cost. But what is freedom if you\ncannot control your own fate?\"\nShe hesitated, the weight of his words pressing down on her. The idea of\ncontrol was tempting\u2014terrifying, but tempting. \"I need time to think,\" she\nsaid, her voice wavering slightly.\nMaelis nodded, though his gaze remained sharp. \"Take all the time you need.

It represented the life she had built here,\nthe quiet simplicity of it, the connections she had with the people around her.\nJoining the guild would mean leaving all of that behind.\nA soft knock at the door drew her from her thoughts, and she turned to see Nira\nstanding in the doorway, her face lined with concern. \"Have you made your\ndecision?\" Nira asked quietly.\nElara shook her head. \"I don't know what to do. If I join the guild, I'll have\ncontrol over my gift. But if I stay, I'll always be afraid of it, afraid of\nwhat I might do.\"\nNira stepped into the room, her eyes filled with a deep sadness. \"The guild may\noffer control, but it comes at a price. They will use you, Elara. They will\nshape you to fit their needs. And once you're part of them, there is no escape.\"\nElara felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes. \"But I don't know if I can\nhandle this on my own. I've already caused so much damage.\"\nNira's expression softened, and she placed a gentle hand on Elara's cheek. \"You\nare stronger than you know. You have the power to choose your own path, to\ndecide how you want to use your gift. The guild doesn't own your fate. You do.\"\nElara blinked back the tears, her heart aching with the weight of her decision.\n\"I'm scared, Grandmother.\"\nNira smiled, her eyes soft. \"We all are, child. But fear is not the enemy. It's\nwhat we do with it that matters.\"\nElara took a deep breath, her resolve hardening. She knew what she had to do.\nThe guild had come for her, offering power and control, but they couldn't offer\nher the one thing she valued most: her freedom.\n\"I won't join them,\" she whispered, the words steady and firm.\nNira nodded, her eyes filled with pride. \"Then you have already chosen the\nright path.\"",

Even\nnow, the threads beneath her fingers seemed to pull her in directions she could\nnot fully control, as if fate itself were resisting her choice.\nSuddenly, the door to her cottage creaked open, and Elara looked up to see\nMaelis standing in the threshold, his expression unreadable. She stood quickly,\nher pulse quickening. She hadn't expected him to return so soon, not after she\nhad refused his offer.\n\"You've made your decision, then,\" Maelis said, his voice smooth, though there\nwas a coldness in his tone that hadn't been there before.\n\"I have,\" Elara replied, her voice steadier than she felt. \"I don't want any\npart of the guild.\"\nMaelis stepped inside, his eyes narrowing as he studied her. \"You think you can\ncontrol your gift on your own? You think you can defy the will of the guild?\"\nElara's heart pounded in her chest, but she stood her ground. \"I don't need the\nguild. I'll find my own way.\"\nMaelis's smile was thin, almost mocking. \"You are playing a dangerous game,\nElara. The guild has been weaving the fate of this world for centuries.

The guild understands this. You do not.\"\nElara's pulse quickened, but she met his gaze with as much resolve as she could\nmuster. \"I understand enough to know that I won't be controlled by you.\"\nMaelis's eyes flashed with something\u2014anger, perhaps, or something deeper,\ndarker. \"Very well,\" he said, his voice low and dangerous. \"But know this,\nElara: the guild does not forget.

She had seen the guild's true power, its dark control over\nthe lives of countless people, and it had shaken her to her core. But she had\nalso seen something else\u2014something that gave her hope.\nOne of the tapestries, hidden in the corner of the vast hall, had been\ndifferent. Its threads were tangled, knotted in places, as if someone had tried\nto unravel it. And next to it, standing quietly in the shadows, had been a\nwoman\u2014a guild member, though not one Elara had met before. The woman had caught\nher eye, and for a brief moment, their gazes had locked. There had been\nsomething in the woman's eyes\u2014something that told Elara she was not alone in\nher doubts about the guild.\nNow, as Elara walked the quiet halls, she felt a presence beside her. The woman\nhad followed her.\n\"You saw it, didn't you?\" the woman said softly, her voice low and cautious.\nElara turned to face her. \"Saw what?\"\n\"The tapestry,\" the woman whispered, glancing around to make sure no one else\nwas listening. \"The one that was unraveling. That's not supposed to happen.\"\nElara's heart quickened. \"Who are you?\"\nThe woman hesitated, her eyes flicking to the shadows as if expecting someone\nto appear. \"My name is Valeria. I'm one of the guild's weavers... but I don't\nagree with everything they do.\"\nElara's breath caught. \"You don't?\"\nValeria shook her head, her expression grave. \"The guild wasn't always like\nthis. Once, we were true weavers\u2014guiding fate, yes, but never forcing it. But\nover time, the guild became obsessed with control, with power. Now, they weave\nnot to guide, but to dominate.\"\nElara's mind raced, her thoughts swirling with confusion and fear. \"Why are you\ntelling me this?\"\nValeria stepped closer, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Because I see\nsomething in you, Elara. You have the power to change things. You don't have to\nbe part of the guild to control your gift. You can choose your own path.\"\nElara's heart pounded in her chest. \"But how? The guild\u2014\"\n\"They don't know everything,\" Valeria interrupted, her eyes flashing with\nintensity. \"There are ways to weave fate that the guild doesn't understand.\nSecrets they've forgotten. I can teach you.\"\nElara stared at her, her mind reeling. Could it be true? Could she really\ncontrol her gift without the guild? Without their dark influence?\n\"Think about it,\" Valeria said softly, stepping back into the shadows. \"But\nknow this\u2014the guild is watching you. And they won't let you go easily.\"",

The sky above was overcast, casting a gray\npall over the village that mirrored the unease swirling inside her. She had\nreturned from the guild with more questions than answers, and now, as she\nlooked around at the familiar faces of her neighbors, she couldn't help but\nwonder if her weaving had already begun to unravel their lives in ways she\ncouldn't control.\nThe villagers went about their business, but something was off. The tension in\nthe air was palpable, a quiet current of suspicion and distrust running through\nevery interaction. Elara had hoped her small weavings\u2014her attempts to ease\ntensions\u2014would help, but it seemed that the opposite was happening. The more\nshe tried to fix things, the worse they became.\nAs she made her way toward the market stalls, she caught sight of Mayor Felin\nspeaking with a group of villagers. His expression was stern, his voice low but\ninsistent. Elara couldn't hear what he was saying, but the looks on the\nvillagers' faces\u2014fear, doubt, anger\u2014made her stomach churn.\nShe took a deep breath and approached, hoping to diffuse the situation before\nit spiraled further out of control. \"Mayor Felin,\" she called, her voice steady\ndespite the unease gnawing at her.\nFelin turned to face her, his eyes narrowing. \"Elara,\" he said, his tone\nclipped. \"I was just speaking with some of the villagers about the... strange\nevents we've been experiencing.\"\nElara's heart skipped a beat. She knew what he was referring to. The crops\nfailing, the animals falling ill, the fires in Glenth\u2014everything pointed to her\nweaving, even if unintentionally. \"I've been trying to help,\" she said quietly,\nglancing around at the gathered crowd. \"But I never meant for any of this to\nhappen.\"\nFelin crossed his arms, his gaze hardening. \"You mean well, Elara. But you have\nto understand, people are scared. They've seen what happens when fate is\ntampered with.\"\nElara's throat tightened, and she nodded. \"I know. I've been trying to control\nit, but...\"\n\"But it's out of your hands,\" Felin finished for her, his voice grim. \"That's\nwhat we're afraid of.\"\nThe crowd murmured in agreement, their eyes fixed on Elara with a mix of\nsuspicion and fear. She felt a wave of guilt wash over her. Everything she had\ndone\u2014everything she had tried to fix\u2014was slipping away from her grasp. And now,\nit seemed, the village itself was turning against her.",

And now, it felt\nlike there was no way out.\nThe sound of footsteps behind her made her jump, and she turned to see a\nfamiliar figure standing at the edge of the clearing.

Now, they felt like chains, binding her to\na fate she couldn't escape.\nA knock at the door made her jump, and she turned to see Maelis standing in the\ndoorway, his expression unreadable.

She had been expecting him,\nthough she had hoped he wouldn't come.\n\"We need to talk,\" he said, his voice low and serious.\nElara stood, her hands trembling. \"I've already made my decision.\"\nMaelis stepped inside, closing the door behind him. \"You think you can control\nthis on your own?\" he asked, his tone calm but laced with warning. \"You're in\nover your head, Elara.

We guide it.\nWe help people find their paths, their true destinies. Without us, the world\nwould fall into chaos.\"\nElara's heart pounded in her chest. She didn't know what to believe anymore.\nThe guild, Iskra, Valeria\u2014everyone had their own version of the truth, their\nown reasons for wanting her to follow their path.

His expression was calm, but there was a coldness in his eyes\nthat made her blood run cold.\n\"I... I didn't mean for this to happen,\" she stammered, her voice trembling. \"I\nwas just trying to help.\"\nMaelis's smile was thin and humorless. \"Help?\" he repeated, his tone mocking.\n\"You've done nothing but make things worse. You're unraveling the very fabric\nof this village with your meddling.\"\nElara's heart pounded in her chest. \"I didn't ask for this gift,\" she\nwhispered, her voice thick with emotion. \"I don't know how to control it.\"\nMaelis's gaze softened slightly, though his expression remained stern. \"That's\nbecause you're trying to fight fate, Elara. You think you can control it, but\nfate is a force beyond your understanding. The more you resist it, the more\nchaos you create.\"\nElara swallowed hard, her hands trembling at her sides. \"What am I supposed to\ndo?\"\nMaelis stepped closer, his voice lowering to a near-whisper. \"You need to stop\nfighting it. You need to accept that fate is inevitable\u2014that it cannot be\ncontrolled or changed. Only then will you find peace.\"\nElara shook her head, her mind racing. She didn't want to accept that\u2014didn't\nwant to believe that her gift was something she couldn't control. But deep\ndown, she knew Maelis was right. The more she tried to change things, the worse\nthey became.\n\"I can help you,\" Maelis continued, his voice smooth and persuasive. \"The guild\ncan teach you how to use your gift, how to guide fate instead of resisting it.\"\nElara hesitated, her heart torn between fear and temptation. The guild's power\nwas vast, and she knew they could help her gain control over her gift. But at\nwhat cost?\n\"I... I don't know,\" she whispered, her voice trembling.\nMaelis's eyes narrowed. \"You don't have a choice, Elara. If you continue down\nthis path, you will destroy everything.\"",

The sky above was a dull gray, the first light of dawn\ncreeping over the horizon. Elara's heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing\nwith the knowledge that the guild's enforcers would be here soon. She felt like\na puppet caught in the tangled threads of fate, pulled in directions she\ncouldn't control.\nValeria stood beside her, her expression calm and resolute. \"They'll be here\nany moment,\" she said quietly, her voice steady. \"Are you ready?\"\nElara nodded, though her hands trembled at her sides. \"As ready as I'll ever\nbe.\"\nA figure appeared on the horizon, and Elara's breath caught in her throat. It\nwas Maelis, leading a group of guild enforcers, their dark robes billowing in\nthe wind as they approached. Her heart pounded, fear clawing at her insides.\nThis was it. The moment she had been dreading.\nMaelis stopped a few paces away, his expression cold and unyielding. \"Elara,\"\nhe said, his voice like ice. \"You've made a grave mistake.\"\nElara swallowed hard, her throat tight with fear. \"I won't let you control me,\"\nshe said, her voice trembling but firm.\nMaelis's eyes narrowed. \"You think you can stand against the guild? You're\nnothing but a child playing with powers you don't understand.\"\nElara's chest tightened, but Valeria stepped forward, her voice sharp. \"She\nunderstands more than you think, Maelis.

I should have known.\"\nValeria's expression remained calm, though her eyes were hard. \"I've turned\nagainst a guild that's lost its way. You don't guide fate\u2014you manipulate it.\nYou've become nothing more than tyrants.\"\nMaelis's smile was cold, devoid of any warmth. \"So be it.\"\nWith a flick of his wrist, the guild enforcers surged forward, their hands\nraised as they prepared to strike. Elara's heart pounded in her chest, fear\nflooding her veins. But before the enforcers could reach them, Valeria stepped\nin front of Elara, her hands outstretched as she began to weave.\nThe air around them shimmered with power, the threads of fate bending to\nValeria's will as she created a barrier between them and the enforcers. Elara\nwatched in awe, her breath catching in her throat. Valeria's weaving was unlike\nanything she had ever seen\u2014precise, controlled, powerful.\nBut even as Valeria fought, Elara could feel the weight of the guild's power\npressing down on them. The enforcers were strong, and their numbers were\ngrowing. They wouldn't stop until they had what they came for.\n\"Now, Elara!\" Valeria shouted, her voice filled with urgency. \"You have to\nweave!\"\nElara's heart raced as she stepped forward, her hands trembling. She didn't\nknow if she was ready, didn't know if she could control the power inside her.\nBut she had to try.\nShe reached out, her fingers finding the invisible threads that connected\neverything around her. The air crackled with energy as she began to weave, her\nhands moving with a speed and precision she hadn't known she possessed. The\nthreads bent to her will, forming a tapestry of fate that wrapped around the\nenforcers, binding them in place.\nMaelis's eyes widened in shock as the enforcers were trapped, unable to move.\n\"What... what have you done?\" he demanded, his voice filled with disbelief.\nElara's chest heaved as she finished the weaving, her heart pounding with\nadrenaline. She had done it. She had stopped them\u2014at least for now.\nBut even as the enforcers struggled against the threads that bound them, Elara\nknew this wasn't the end.

But\nwithout the loom, they won't have the same power. The guild as it was is over.\"\nElara's gaze drifted to the shattered remains of the loom. The guild had been\nher enemy, but now that their power was broken, she couldn't help but feel a\npang of sadness. So much had been lost\u2014so much history, so much tradition. But\nValeria was right. It had to end.",
