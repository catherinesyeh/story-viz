She had swept the\nhearth, and made a bright blazing fire for our reception; the servant\nhad just brought in the tea-tray; and Rose was producing the\nsugar-basin and tea-caddy from the cupboard in the black oak\nside-board, that shone like polished ebony, in the cheerful parlour\ntwilight.",

He growled, and\ntried to look sulky, and then we all took our seats at the table, in\nobedience to the thrice-repeated summons of Rose.\n\"Now take your tea,\" said she; \"and I'll tell you what _I've_ been\ndoing. I've been to call on the Wilsons; and it's a _thousand_ pities\nyou didn't go with me, Gilbert, for Eliza Millward was there!\"\n\"Well! what of her?\"\n\"Oh, nothing!\u2014I'm not going to tell you about her;\u2014only that she's a\nnice, amusing little thing, when she is in a merry humour, and I\nshouldn't mind calling her\u2014\"\n\"Hush, hush, my dear! your brother has no such idea!\" whispered my\nmother earnestly, holding up her finger.\n\"Well,\" resumed Rose; \"I was going to tell you an important piece of\nnews I heard there\u2014I have been bursting with it ever since. You know it\nwas reported a month ago, that somebody was going to take Wildfell\nHall\u2014and\u2014what do you think?

The place is in ruins!\"\n\"She has had two or three rooms made habitable; and there she lives,\nall alone\u2014except an old woman for a servant!\"\n\"Oh, dear! that spoils it\u2014I'd hoped she was a witch,\" observed Fergus,\nwhile carving his inch-thick slice of bread and butter. \"Nonsense,\nFergus! But isn't it strange, mamma?\"\n\"Strange! I can hardly believe it.\"\n\"But you may believe it; for Jane Wilson has seen her. She went with\nher mother, who, of course, when she heard of a stranger being in the\nneighbourhood, would be on pins and needles till she had seen her and\ngot all she could out of her. She is called Mrs. Graham, and she is in\nmourning\u2014not widow's weeds, but slightish mourning\u2014and she is quite\nyoung, they say,\u2014not above five or six and twenty,\u2014but _so_ reserved!\nThey tried all they could to find out who she was and where she came\nfrom, and, all about her, but neither Mrs. Wilson, with her\npertinacious and impertinent home-thrusts, nor Miss Wilson, with her\nskilful man\u0153uvring, could manage to elicit a single satisfactory\nanswer, or even a casual remark, or chance expression calculated to\nallay their curiosity, or throw the faintest ray of light upon her\nhistory, circumstances, or connections. Moreover, she was barely civil\nto them, and evidently better pleased to say \"good-by,\" than \"how do\nyou do.\" But Eliza Millward says her father intends to call upon her\nsoon, to offer some pastoral advice, which he fears she needs, as,\nthough she is known to have entered the neighbourhood early last week,\nshe did not make her appearance at church on Sunday; and she\u2014Eliza,\nthat is\u2014will beg to accompany him, and is sure _she_ can succeed in\nwheedling something out of her\u2014you know, Gilbert, _she_ can do\nanything. And _we_ should call some time, mamma; it's only proper, you\nknow.\"\n\"Of course, my dear. Poor thing! How lonely she must feel!\"\n\"And pray, be quick about it; and mind you bring me word how much sugar\nshe puts in her tea, and what sort of caps and aprons she wears, and\nall about it; for I don't know how I can live till I know,\" said\nFergus, very gravely.\nBut if he intended the speech to be hailed as a master-stroke of wit,\nhe signally failed, for nobody laughed. However, he was not much\ndisconcerted at that; for when he had taken a mouthful of bread and\nbutter and was about to swallow a gulp of tea, the humour of the thing\nburst upon him with such irresistible force, that he was obliged to\njump up from the table, and rush snorting and choking from the room;\nand a minute after, was heard screaming in fearful agony in the garden.\nAs for me, I was hungry, and contented myself with silently demolishing\nthe tea, ham, and toast, while my mother and sister went on talking,\nand continued to discuss the apparent or non-apparent circumstances,\nand probable or improbable history of the mysterious lady; but I must\nconfess that, after my brother's misadventure, I once or twice raised\nthe cup to my lips, and put it down again without daring to taste the\ncontents, lest I should injure my dignity by a similar explosion.",

            "text": "\"Some romantic young widow, I suppose,\" said I, \"come there to end her\ndays in solitude, and mourn in secret for the dear departed\u2014but it\nwon't last long.\"\n\"No, I think not,\" observed Rose; \"for she didn't seem _very_\ndisconsolate after all; and she's excessively pretty\u2014handsome\nrather\u2014you must see her, Gilbert; you will call her a perfect beauty,\nthough you could hardly pretend to discover a resemblance between her\nand Eliza Millward.\"\n\"Well, I can imagine many faces more beautiful than Eliza's, though not\nmore charming. I allow she has small claims to perfection; but then, I\nmaintain that, if she were more perfect, she would be less\ninteresting.\"\n\"And so you prefer her faults to other people's perfections?\"\n\"Just so\u2014saving my mother's presence.\"\n\"Oh, my dear Gilbert, what nonsense you talk!\u2014I know you don't mean it;\nit's quite out of the question,\" said my mother, getting up, and\nbustling out of the room, under pretence of household business, in\norder to escape the contradiction that was trembling on my tongue.\nAfter that Rose favoured me with further particulars respecting Mrs.\nGraham. Her appearance, manners, and dress, and the very furniture of\nthe room she inhabited, were all set before me, with rather more\nclearness and precision than I cared to see them; but, as I was not a\nvery attentive listener, I could not repeat the description if I would.\nThe next day was Saturday; and, on Sunday, everybody wondered whether\nor not the fair unknown would profit by the vicar's remonstrance, and\ncome to church. I confess I looked with some interest myself towards\nthe old family pew, appertaining to Wildfell Hall, where the faded\ncrimson cushions and lining had been unpressed and unrenewed so many\nyears, and the grim escutcheons, with their lugubrious borders of rusty\nblack cloth, frowned so sternly from the wall above.\nAnd there I beheld a tall, lady-like figure, clad in black. Her face\nwas towards me, and there was something in it which, once seen, invited\nme to look again. Her hair was raven black, and disposed in long glossy\nringlets, a style of coiffure rather unusual in those days, but always\ngraceful and becoming; her complexion was clear and pale; her eyes I\ncould not see, for, being bent upon her prayer-book, they were\nconcealed by their drooping lids and long black lashes, but the brows\nabove were expressive and well defined; the forehead was lofty and\nintellectual, the nose, a perfect aquiline and the features, in\ngeneral, unexceptionable\u2014only there was a slight hollowness about the\ncheeks and eyes, and the lips, though finely formed, were a little too\nthin, a little too firmly compressed, and had something about them that\nbetokened, I thought, no very soft or amiable temper; and I said in my\nheart\u2014\"I would rather admire you from this distance, fair lady, than be\nthe partner of your home.\"\nJust then she happened to raise her eyes, and they met mine; I did not\nchoose to withdraw my gaze, and she turned again to her book, but with\na momentary, indefinable expression of quiet scorn, that was\ninexpressibly provoking to me.\n\"She thinks me an impudent puppy,\" thought I. \"Humph!\u2014she shall change\nher mind before long, if I think it worth while.\"\nBut then it flashed upon me that these were very improper thoughts for\na place of worship, and that my behaviour, on the present occasion, was\nanything but what it ought to be. Previous, however, to directing my\nmind to the service, I glanced round the church to see if any one had\nbeen observing me;\u2014but no,\u2014all, who were not attending to their\nprayer-books, were attending to the strange lady,\u2014my good mother and\nsister among the rest, and Mrs. Wilson and her daughter; and even Eliza\nMillward was slily glancing from the corners of her eyes towards the\nobject of general attraction. Then she glanced at me, simpered a\nlittle, and blushed, modestly looked at her prayer-book, and\nendeavoured to compose her features.\nHere I was transgressing again; and this time I was made sensible of it\nby a sudden dig in the ribs, from the elbow of my pert brother. For the\npresent, I could only resent the insult by pressing my foot upon his\ntoes, deferring further vengeance till we got out of church.\nNow, Halford, before I close this letter, I'll tell you who Eliza\nMillward was: she was the vicar's younger daughter, and a very engaging\nlittle creature, for whom I felt no small degree of partiality;\u2014and she\nknew it, though I had never come to any direct explanation, and had no\ndefinite intention of so doing, for my mother, who maintained there was\nno one good enough for me within twenty miles round, could not bear the\nthoughts of my marrying that insignificant little thing, who, in\naddition to her numerous other disqualifications, had not twenty pounds\nto call her own. Eliza's figure was at once slight and plump, her face\nsmall, and nearly as round as my sister's,\u2014complexion, something\nsimilar to hers, but more delicate and less decidedly blooming,\u2014nose,\n_retrouss\u00e9_,\u2014features, generally irregular; and, altogether, she was\nrather charming than pretty. But her eyes\u2014I must not forget those\nremarkable features, for therein her chief attraction lay\u2014in outward\naspect at least;\u2014they were long and narrow in shape, the irids black,\nor very dark brown, the expression various, and ever changing, but\nalways either preternaturally\u2014I had almost said _diabolically_\u2014wicked,\nor irresistibly bewitching\u2014often both. Her voice was gentle and\nchildish, her tread light and soft as that of a cat:\u2014but her manners\nmore frequently resembled those of a pretty playful kitten, that is now\npert and roguish, now timid and demure, according to its own sweet\nwill.\nHer sister, Mary, was several years older, several inches taller, and\nof a larger, coarser build\u2014a plain, quiet, sensible girl, who had\npatiently nursed their mother, through her last long, tedious illness,\nand been the housekeeper, and family drudge, from thence to the present\ntime. She was trusted and valued by her father, loved and courted by\nall dogs, cats, children, and poor people, and slighted and neglected\nby everybody else.",

            "text": "The Reverend Michael Millward himself was a tall, ponderous elderly\ngentleman, who placed a shovel hat above his large, square,\nmassive-featured face, carried a stout walking-stick in his hand, and\nincased his still powerful limbs in knee-breeches and gaiters,\u2014or black\nsilk stockings on state occasions. He was a man of fixed principles,\nstrong prejudices, and regular habits, intolerant of dissent in any\nshape, acting under a firm conviction that _his_ opinions were always\nright, and whoever differed from them must be either most deplorably\nignorant, or wilfully blind.\nIn childhood, I had always been accustomed to regard him with a feeling\nof reverential awe\u2014but lately, even now, surmounted, for, though he had\na fatherly kindness for the well-behaved, he was a strict\ndisciplinarian, and had often sternly reproved our juvenile failings\nand peccadilloes; and moreover, in those days, whenever he called upon\nour parents, we had to stand up before him, and say our catechism, or\nrepeat, \"How doth the little busy bee,\" or some other hymn, or\u2014worse\nthan all\u2014be questioned about his last text, and the heads of the\ndiscourse, which we never could remember. Sometimes, the worthy\ngentleman would reprove my mother for being over-indulgent to her sons,\nwith a reference to old Eli, or David and Absalom, which was\nparticularly galling to her feelings; and, very highly as she respected\nhim, and all his sayings, I once heard her exclaim, \"I wish to goodness\nhe had a son himself! He wouldn't be so ready with his advice to other\npeople then;\u2014he'd see what it is to have a couple of boys to keep in\norder.\"\nHe had a laudable care for his own bodily health\u2014kept very early hours,\nregularly took a walk before breakfast, was vastly particular about\nwarm and dry clothing, had never been known to preach a sermon without\npreviously swallowing a raw egg\u2014albeit he was gifted with good lungs\nand a powerful voice,\u2014and was, generally, extremely particular about\nwhat he ate and drank, though by no means abstemious, and having a mode\nof dietary peculiar to himself,\u2014being a great despiser of tea and such\nslops, and a patron of malt liquors, bacon and eggs, ham, hung beef,\nand other strong meats, which agreed well enough with his digestive\norgans, and therefore were maintained by him to be good and wholesome\nfor everybody, and confidently recommended to the most delicate\nconvalescents or dyspeptics, who, if they failed to derive the promised\nbenefit from his prescriptions, were told it was because they had not\npersevered, and if they complained of inconvenient results therefrom,\nwere assured it was all fancy.\nI will just touch upon two other persons whom I have mentioned, and\nthen bring this long letter to a close. These are Mrs. Wilson and her\ndaughter. The former was the widow of a substantial farmer, a\nnarrow-minded, tattling old gossip, whose character is not worth\ndescribing. She had two sons, Robert, a rough countrified farmer, and\nRichard, a retiring, studious young man, who was studying the classics\nwith the vicar's assistance, preparing for college, with a view to\nenter the church.\nTheir sister Jane was a young lady of some talents, and more ambition.\nShe had, at her own desire, received a regular boarding-school\neducation, superior to what any member of the family had obtained\nbefore. She had taken the polish well, acquired considerable elegance\nof manners, quite lost her provincial accent, and could boast of more\naccomplishments than the vicar's daughters. She was considered a beauty\nbesides; but never for a moment could she number me amongst her\nadmirers. She was about six and twenty, rather tall and very slender,\nher hair was neither chestnut nor auburn, but a most decided bright,\nlight red; her complexion was remarkably fair and brilliant, her head\nsmall, neck long, chin well turned, but very short, lips thin and red,\neyes clear hazel, quick, and penetrating, but entirely destitute of\npoetry or feeling. She had, or might have had, many suitors in her own\nrank of life, but scornfully repulsed or rejected them all; for none\nbut a gentleman could please her refined taste, and none but a rich one\ncould satisfy her soaring ambition. One gentleman there was, from whom\nshe had lately received some rather pointed attentions, and upon whose\nheart, name, and fortune, it was whispered, she had serious designs.\nThis was Mr. Lawrence, the young squire, whose family had formerly\noccupied Wildfell Hall, but had deserted it, some fifteen years ago,\nfor a more modern and commodious mansion in the neighbouring parish.\nNow, Halford, I bid you adieu for the present. This is the first\ninstalment of my debt. If the coin suits you, tell me so, and I'll send\nyou the rest at my leisure: if you would rather remain my creditor than\nstuff your purse with such ungainly, heavy pieces,\u2014tell me still, and\nI'll pardon your bad taste, and willingly keep the treasure to myself.",

On the following Tuesday I was out with my dog and\ngun, in pursuit of such game as I could find within the territory of\nLinden-Car; but finding none at all, I turned my arms against the hawks\nand carrion crows, whose depredations, as I suspected, had deprived me\nof better prey. To this end I left the more frequented regions, the\nwooded valleys, the corn-fields, and the meadow-lands, and proceeded to\nmount the steep acclivity of Wildfell, the wildest and the loftiest\neminence in our neighbourhood, where, as you ascend, the hedges, as\nwell as the trees, become scanty and stunted, the former, at length,\ngiving place to rough stone fences, partly greened over with ivy and\nmoss, the latter to larches and Scotch fir-trees, or isolated\nblackthorns. The fields, being rough and stony, and wholly unfit for\nthe plough, were mostly devoted to the pasturing of sheep and cattle;\nthe soil was thin and poor: bits of grey rock here and there peeped out\nfrom the grassy hillocks; bilberry-plants and heather\u2014relics of more\nsavage wildness\u2014grew under the walls; and in many of the enclosures,\nragweeds and rushes usurped supremacy over the scanty herbage; but\nthese were not _my_ property.\nNear the top of this hill, about two miles from Linden-Car, stood\nWildfell Hall, a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era, built of\ndark grey stone, venerable and picturesque to look at, but doubtless,\ncold and gloomy enough to inhabit, with its thick stone mullions and\nlittle latticed panes, its time-eaten air-holes, and its too lonely,\ntoo unsheltered situation,\u2014only shielded from the war of wind and\nweather by a group of Scotch firs, themselves half blighted with\nstorms, and looking as stern and gloomy as the Hall itself. Behind it\nlay a few desolate fields, and then the brown heath-clad summit of the\nhill; before it (enclosed by stone walls, and entered by an iron gate,\nwith large balls of grey granite\u2014similar to those which decorated the\nroof and gables\u2014surmounting the gate-posts) was a garden,\u2014once stocked\nwith such hard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and\nclimate, and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardener's\ntorturing shears, and most readily assume the shapes he chose to give\nthem,\u2014now, having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed,\nabandoned to the weeds and the grass, to the frost and the wind, the\nrain and the drought, it presented a very singular appearance indeed.",

The little creature raised its face and\ncalled aloud to the dog. The good-natured animal paused, looked up, and\nwagged his tail, but made no further advances. The child (a little boy,\napparently about five years old) scrambled up to the top of the wall,\nand called again and again; but finding this of no avail, apparently\nmade up his mind, like Mahomet, to go to the mountain, since the\nmountain would not come to him, and attempted to get over; but a\ncrabbed old cherry-tree, that grew hard by, caught him by the frock in\none of its crooked scraggy arms that stretched over the wall. In\nattempting to disengage himself his foot slipped, and down he\ntumbled\u2014but not to the earth;\u2014the tree still kept him suspended. There\nwas a silent struggle, and then a piercing shriek;\u2014but, in an instant,\nI had dropped my gun on the grass, and caught the little fellow in my\narms.\nI wiped his eyes with his frock, told him he was all right and called\nSancho to pacify him. He was just putting little hand on the dog's neck\nand beginning to smile through his tears, when I heard behind me a\nclick of the iron gate, and a rustle of female garments, and lo! Mrs.\nGraham darted upon me\u2014her neck uncovered, her black locks streaming in\nthe wind.\n\"Give me the child!\" she said, in a voice scarce louder than a whisper,\nbut with a tone of startling vehemence, and, seizing the boy, she\nsnatched him from me, as if some dire contamination were in my touch,\nand then stood with one hand firmly clasping his, the other on his\nshoulder, fixing upon me her large, luminous dark eyes\u2014pale,\nbreathless, quivering with agitation.\n\"I was not harming the child, madam,\" said I, scarce knowing whether to\nbe most astonished or displeased; \"he was tumbling off the wall there;\nand I was so fortunate as to catch him, while he hung suspended\nheadlong from that tree, and prevent I know not what catastrophe.\"\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" stammered she;\u2014suddenly calming down,\u2014the\nlight of reason seeming to break upon her beclouded spirit, and a faint\nblush mantling on her cheek\u2014\"I did not know you;\u2014and I thought\u2014\"\nShe stooped to kiss the child, and fondly clasped her arm round his\nneck.\n\"You thought I was going to kidnap your son, I suppose?\"\nShe stroked his head with a half-embarrassed laugh, and replied,\u2014\"I did\nnot know he had attempted to climb the wall.\u2014I have the pleasure of\naddressing Mr. Markham, I believe?\" she added, somewhat abruptly.\nI bowed, but ventured to ask how she knew me.\n\"Your sister called here, a few days ago, with Mrs. Markham.\"\n\"Is the resemblance so strong then?\" I asked, in some surprise, and not\nso greatly flattered at the idea as I ought to have been.\n\"There is a likeness about the eyes and complexion I think,\" replied\nshe, somewhat dubiously surveying my face;\u2014\"and I think I saw you at\nchurch on Sunday.\"\nI smiled.\u2014There was something either in that smile or the recollections\nit awakened that was particularly displeasing to her, for she suddenly\nassumed again that proud, chilly look that had so unspeakably roused my\naversion at church\u2014a look of repellent scorn, so easily assumed, and so\nentirely without the least distortion of a single feature, that, while\nthere, it seemed like the natural expression of the face, and was the\nmore provoking to me, because I could not think it affected.\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Markham,\" said she; and without another word or\nglance, she withdrew, with her child, into the garden; and I returned\nhome, angry and dissatisfied\u2014I could scarcely tell you why, and\ntherefore will not attempt it.",

We seemed, indeed, to be mutually pleased with each other, and\nmanaged to maintain between us a cheerful and animated though not very\nprofound conversation. It was little better than a _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_, for\nMiss Millward never opened her lips, except occasionally to correct\nsome random assertion or exaggerated expression of her sister's, and\nonce to ask her to pick up the ball of cotton that had rolled under the\ntable. I did this myself, however, as in duty bound.\n\"Thank you, Mr. Markham,\" said she, as I presented it to her. \"I would\nhave picked it up myself; only I did not want to disturb the cat.\"\n\"Mary, dear, _that_ won't excuse you in Mr. Markham's eyes,\" said\nEliza; \"he hates cats, I daresay, as cordially as he does old\nmaids\u2014like all other gentlemen.

I tenderly\nsqueezed her little hand at parting; and she repaid me with one of her\nsoftest smiles and most bewitching glances.

Is it the circumstance of\nbeing able and willing to resist temptation; or that of having no\ntemptations to resist?\u2014Is he a strong man that overcomes great\nobstacles and performs surprising achievements, though by dint of great\nmuscular exertion, and at the risk of some subsequent fatigue, or he\nthat sits in his chair all day, with nothing to do more laborious than\nstirring the fire, and carrying his food to his mouth? If you would\nhave your son to walk honourably through the world, you must not\nattempt to clear the stones from his path, but teach him to walk firmly\nover them\u2014not insist upon leading him by the hand, but let him learn to\ngo alone.\"\n\"I will lead him by the hand, Mr. Markham, till he has strength to go\nalone; and I will clear as many stones from his path as I can, and\nteach him to avoid the _rest_\u2014or walk firmly over them, as you say;\u2014for\nwhen I have done my utmost, in the way of clearance, there will still\nbe plenty left to exercise all the agility, steadiness, and\ncircumspection he will ever have.\u2014It is all very well to talk about\nnoble resistance, and trials of virtue; but for fifty\u2014or five hundred\nmen that have yielded to temptation, show me one that has had virtue to\nresist. And why should I take it for granted that my son will be one in\na thousand?\u2014and not rather prepare for the worst, and suppose he will\nbe like his\u2014like the rest of mankind, unless I take care to prevent\nit?\"\n\"You are very complimentary to us all,\" I observed.\n\"I know nothing about _you_\u2014I speak of those I do know\u2014and when I see\nthe whole race of mankind (with a few rare exceptions) stumbling and\nblundering along the path of life, sinking into every pitfall, and\nbreaking their shins over every impediment that lies in their way,\nshall I not use all the means in my power to insure for him a smoother\nand a safer passage?\"\n\"Yes, but the surest means will be to endeavour to fortify him\n_against_ temptation, not to remove it out of his way.\"\n\"I will do both, Mr. Markham. God knows he will have temptations enough\nto assail him, both from within and without, when I have done all I can\nto render vice as uninviting to him, as it is abominable in its own\nnature\u2014I myself have had, indeed, but few incentives to what the world\ncalls vice, but yet I have experienced temptations and trials of\nanother kind, that have required, on many occasions, more watchfulness\nand firmness to resist than I have hitherto been able to muster against\nthem. And this, I believe, is what most others would acknowledge who\nare accustomed to reflection, and wishful to strive against their\nnatural corruptions.\"\n\"Yes,\" said my mother, but half apprehending her drift; \"but you would\nnot judge of a boy by yourself\u2014and, my dear Mrs. Graham, let me warn\nyou in good time against the error\u2014the fatal error, I may call it\u2014of\ntaking that boy's education upon yourself. Because you are clever in\nsome things and well informed, you may fancy yourself equal to the\ntask; but indeed you are not; and if you persist in the attempt,\nbelieve me you will bitterly repent it when the mischief is done.\"\n\"I am to send him to school, I suppose, to learn to despise his\nmother's authority and affection!\" said the lady, with rather a bitter\nsmile.\n\"Oh, _no!_\u2014But if you would have a boy to despise his mother, let her\nkeep him at home, and spend her life in petting him up, and slaving to\nindulge his follies and caprices.\"\n\"I perfectly agree with you, Mrs. Markham; but nothing can be further\nfrom my principles and practice than such criminal weakness as that.\"\n\"Well, but you will treat him like a girl\u2014you'll spoil his spirit, and\nmake a mere Miss Nancy of him\u2014you will, indeed, Mrs. Graham, whatever\nyou may think. But I'll get Mr. Millward to talk to you about\nit:\u2014_he'll_ tell you the consequences;\u2014he'll set it before you as plain\nas the day;\u2014and tell you what you ought to do, and all about it;\u2014and, I\ndon't doubt, he'll be able to convince you in a minute.\"\n\"No occasion to trouble the vicar,\" said Mrs. Graham, glancing at me\u2014I\nsuppose I was smiling at my mother's unbounded confidence in that\nworthy gentleman\u2014\"Mr. Markham here thinks his powers of conviction at\nleast equal to Mr. Millward's. If I hear not him, neither should I be\nconvinced though one rose from the dead, he would tell you. Well, Mr.\nMarkham, you that maintain that a boy should not be shielded from evil,\nbut sent out to battle against it, alone and unassisted\u2014not taught to\navoid the snares of life, but boldly to rush into them, or over them,\nas he may\u2014to seek danger, rather than shun it, and feed his virtue by\ntemptation,\u2014would you\u2014?\"\n\"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Graham\u2014but you get on too fast. I have not yet\nsaid that a boy should be taught to rush into the snares of life,\u2014or\neven wilfully to seek temptation for the sake of exercising his virtue\nby overcoming it;\u2014I only say that it is better to arm and strengthen\nyour hero, than to disarm and enfeeble the foe;\u2014and if you were to rear\nan oak sapling in a hothouse, tending it carefully night and day, and\nshielding it from every breath of wind, you could not expect it to\nbecome a hardy tree, like that which has grown up on the mountain-side,\nexposed to all the action of the elements, and not even sheltered from\nthe shock of the tempest.\"\n\"Granted;\u2014but would you use the same argument with regard to a girl?\"\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\"No; you would have her to be tenderly and delicately nurtured, like a\nhot-house plant\u2014taught to cling to others for direction and support,\nand guarded, as much as possible, from the very knowledge of evil. But\nwill you be so good as to inform me why you make this distinction? Is\nit that you think she _has_ no virtue?\"\n\"Assuredly not.\"\n\"Well, but you affirm that virtue is only elicited by temptation;\u2014and\nyou think that a woman cannot be too little exposed to temptation, or\ntoo little acquainted with vice, or anything connected therewith. It\n_must_ be either that you think she is essentially so vicious, or so\nfeeble-minded, that she _cannot_ withstand temptation,\u2014and though she\nmay be pure and innocent as long as she is kept in ignorance and\nrestraint, yet, being destitute of _real_ virtue, to teach her how to\nsin is at once to make her a sinner, and the greater her knowledge, the\nwider her liberty, the deeper will be her depravity,\u2014whereas, in the\nnobler sex, there is a natural tendency to goodness, guarded by a\nsuperior fortitude, which, the more it is exercised by trials and\ndangers, is only the further developed\u2014\"\n\"Heaven forbid that I should think so!\" I interrupted her at last.\n\"Well, then, it must be that you think they are _both_ weak and prone\nto err, and the slightest error, the merest shadow of pollution, will\nruin the one, while the character of the other will be strengthened and\nembellished\u2014his education properly finished by a little practical\nacquaintance with forbidden things. Such experience, to him (to use a\ntrite simile), will be like the storm to the oak, which, though it may\nscatter the leaves, and snap the smaller branches, serves but to rivet\nthe roots, and to harden and condense the fibres of the tree. You would\nhave us encourage our sons to prove all things by their own experience,\nwhile our daughters must not even profit by the experience of others.\nNow _I_ would have both so to benefit by the experience of others, and\nthe precepts of a higher authority, that they should know beforehand to\nrefuse the evil and choose the good, and require no experimental proofs\nto teach them the evil of transgression. I would not send a poor girl\ninto the world, unarmed against her foes, and ignorant of the snares\nthat beset her path; nor would I watch and guard her, till, deprived of\nself-respect and self-reliance, she lost the power or the will to watch\nand guard herself;\u2014and as for my son\u2014if I thought he would grow up to\nbe what you call a man of the world\u2014one that has '_seen life_,' and\nglories in his experience, even though he should so far profit by it as\nto sober down, at length, into a useful and respected member of\nsociety\u2014I would rather that he died to-morrow!\u2014rather a thousand\ntimes!\" she earnestly repeated, pressing her darling to her side and\nkissing his forehead with intense affection. He had already left his\nnew companion, and been standing for some time beside his mother's\nknee, looking up into her face, and listening in silent wonder to her",

She had brought her knitting with her, and it seemed as if her\ntongue had laid a wager with her fingers, to outdo them in swift and\nceaseless motion.\nHer daughter Jane was, of course, as graceful and elegant, as witty and\nseductive, as she could possibly manage to be; for here were all the\nladies to outshine, and all the gentlemen to charm,\u2014and Mr. Lawrence,\nespecially, to capture and subdue. Her little arts to effect his\nsubjugation were too subtle and impalpable to attract my observation;\nbut I thought there was a certain _refined_ affectation of superiority,\nand an ungenial self-consciousness about her, that negatived all her\nadvantages; and after she was gone, Rose interpreted to me her various\nlooks, words, and actions with a mingled acuteness and asperity that\nmade me wonder, equally, at the lady's artifice and my sister's\npenetration, and ask myself if she too had an eye to the squire\u2014but\nnever mind, Halford; she had not.\nRichard Wilson, Jane's younger brother, sat in a corner, apparently\ngood-tempered, but silent and shy, desirous to escape observation, but\nwilling enough to listen and observe: and, although somewhat out of his\nelement, he would have been happy enough in his own quiet way, if my\nmother could only have let him alone; but in her mistaken kindness, she\nwould keep persecuting him with her attentions\u2014pressing upon him all\nmanner of viands, under the notion that he was too bashful to help\nhimself, and obliging him to shout across the room his monosyllabic\nreplies to the numerous questions and observations by which she vainly\nattempted to draw him into conversation.\nRose informed me that he never would have favoured us with his company\nbut for the importunities of his sister Jane, who was most anxious to\nshow Mr. Lawrence that she had at least one brother more gentlemanly\nand refined than Robert. That worthy individual she had been equally\nsolicitous to keep away; but he affirmed that he saw no reason why he\nshould not enjoy a crack with Markham and the old lady (my mother was\nnot old, really), and bonny Miss Rose and the parson, as well as the\nbest;\u2014and he was in the right of it too. So he talked common-place with\nmy mother and Rose, and discussed parish affairs with the vicar,\nfarming matters with me, and politics with us both.\nMary Millward was another mute,\u2014not so much tormented with cruel\nkindness as Dick Wilson, because she had a certain short, decided way\nof answering and refusing, and was supposed to be rather sullen than\ndiffident. However that might be, she certainly did not give much\npleasure to the company;\u2014nor did she appear to derive much from it.\nEliza told me she had only come because her father insisted upon it,\nhaving taken it into his head that she devoted herself too exclusively\nto her household duties, to the neglect of such relaxations and\ninnocent enjoyments as were proper to her age and sex. She seemed to me\nto be good-humoured enough on the whole. Once or twice she was provoked\nto laughter by the wit or the merriment of some favoured individual\namongst us; and then I observed she sought the eye of Richard Wilson,\nwho sat over against her. As he studied with her father, she had some\nacquaintance with him, in spite of the retiring habits of both, and I\nsuppose there was a kind of fellow-feeling established between them.\nMy Eliza was charming beyond description, coquettish without\naffectation, and evidently more desirous to engage my attention than\nthat of all the room besides. Her delight in having me near her, seated\nor standing by her side, whispering in her ear, or pressing her hand in\nthe dance, was plainly legible in her glowing face and heaving bosom,\nhowever belied by saucy words and gestures. But I had better hold my\ntongue: if I boast of these things now, I shall have to blush\nhereafter.\nTo proceed, then, with the various individuals of our party; Rose was\nsimple and natural as usual, and full of mirth and vivacity.",

I always prefer your home-brewed to anything else.\"\nFlattered at this compliment, my mother rang the bell, and a china jug\nof our best ale was presently brought and set before the worthy\ngentleman who so well knew how to appreciate its excellences.\n\"Now THIS is the thing!\" cried he, pouring out a glass of the same in a\nlong stream, skilfully directed from the jug to the tumbler, so as to\nproduce much foam without spilling a drop; and, having surveyed it for\na moment opposite the candle, he took a deep draught, and then smacked\nhis lips, drew a long breath, and refilled his glass, my mother looking\non with the greatest satisfaction.\n\"There's nothing like this, Mrs. Markham!\" said he. \"I always maintain\nthat there's nothing to compare with your home-brewed ale.\"\n\"I'm sure I'm glad you like it, sir. I always look after the brewing\nmyself, as well as the cheese and the butter\u2014I like to have things well\ndone, while we're about it.\"\n\"_Quite right_, Mrs. Markham!\"\n\"But then, Mr. Millward, you don't think it _wrong_ to take a little\nwine now and then\u2014or a little spirits either!\" said my mother, as she\nhanded a smoking tumbler of gin-and-water to Mrs. Wilson, who affirmed\nthat wine sat heavy on her stomach, and whose son Robert was at that\nmoment helping himself to a pretty stiff glass of the same.\n\"By no means!\" replied the oracle, with a Jove-like nod; \"these things\nare all blessings and mercies, if we only knew how to make use of\nthem.\"\n\"But Mrs. Graham doesn't think so. You shall just hear now what she\ntold us the other day\u2014I _told_ her I'd tell you.\"\nAnd my mother favoured the company with a particular account of that\nlady's mistaken ideas and conduct regarding the matter in hand,\nconcluding with, \"Now, don't you think it is wrong?\"\n\"Wrong!\" repeated the vicar, with more than common solemnity\u2014\"criminal,\nI should say\u2014criminal! Not only is it making a fool of the boy, but it\nis despising the gifts of Providence, and teaching him to trample them\nunder his feet.\"\nHe then entered more fully into the question, and explained at large\nthe folly and impiety of such a proceeding. My mother heard him with\nprofoundest reverence; and even Mrs. Wilson vouchsafed to rest her\ntongue for a moment, and listen in silence, while she complacently\nsipped her gin-and-water. Mr. Lawrence sat with his elbow on the table,\ncarelessly playing with his half-empty wine-glass, and covertly smiling\nto himself.\n\"But don't you think, Mr. Millward,\" suggested he, when at length that\ngentleman paused in his discourse, \"that when a child may be naturally\nprone to intemperance\u2014by the fault of its parents or ancestors, for\ninstance\u2014some precautions are advisable?\" (Now it was generally\nbelieved that Mr. Lawrence's father had shortened his days by\nintemperance.)\n\"Some precautions, it may be; but temperance, sir, is one thing, and\nabstinence another.\"\n\"But I have heard that, with some persons, temperance\u2014that is,\nmoderation\u2014is almost impossible; and if abstinence be an evil (which\nsome have doubted), no one will deny that excess is a greater. Some\nparents have entirely prohibited their children from tasting\nintoxicating liquors; but a parent's authority cannot last for ever;\nchildren are naturally prone to hanker after forbidden things; and a\nchild, in such a case, would be likely to have a strong curiosity to\ntaste, and try the effect of what has been so lauded and enjoyed by\nothers, so strictly forbidden to himself\u2014which curiosity would\ngenerally be gratified on the first convenient opportunity; and the\nrestraint once broken, serious consequences might ensue. I don't\npretend to be a judge of such matters, but it seems to me, that this\nplan of Mrs. Graham's, as you describe it, Mrs. Markham, extraordinary\nas it may be, is not without its advantages; for here you see the child\nis delivered at once from temptation; he has no secret curiosity, no\nhankering desire; he is as well acquainted with the tempting liquors as\nhe ever wishes to be; and is thoroughly disgusted with them, without\nhaving suffered from their effects.\"\n\"And is that right, sir? Have I not proven to you how wrong it is\u2014how\ncontrary to Scripture and to reason, to teach a child to look with\ncontempt and disgust upon the blessings of Providence, instead of to\nuse them aright?\"\n\"You may consider laudanum a blessing of Providence, sir,\" replied Mr.\nLawrence, smiling; \"and yet, you will allow that most of us had better\nabstain from it, even in moderation; but,\" added he, \"I would not\ndesire you to follow out my simile too closely\u2014in witness whereof I\nfinish my glass.\"",

But\nMary Millward obstinately refused to join us; and so did Richard\nWilson, though my mother earnestly entreated him to do so, and even\noffered to be his partner.\nWe managed very well without them, however. With a single set of\nquadrilles, and several country dances, we carried it on to a pretty\nlate hour; and at length, having called upon our musician to strike up\na waltz, I was just about to whirl Eliza round in that delightful\ndance, accompanied by Lawrence and Jane Wilson, and Fergus and Rose,\nwhen Mr. Millward interposed with:\u2014\"No, no; I don't allow that! Come,\nit's time to be going now.\"\n\"Oh, no, papa!\" pleaded Eliza.\n\"High time, my girl\u2014high time! Moderation in all things, remember!\nThat's the plan\u2014'Let your moderation be known unto all men!'\"\nBut in revenge I followed Eliza into the dimly-lighted passage, where,\nunder pretence of helping her on with her shawl, I fear I must plead\nguilty to snatching a kiss behind her father's back, while he was\nenveloping his throat and chin in the folds of a mighty comforter. But\nalas! in turning round, there was my mother close beside me. The\nconsequence was, that no sooner were the guests departed, than I was\ndoomed to a very serious remonstrance, which unpleasantly checked the\ngalloping course of my spirits, and made a disagreeable close to the\nevening.\n\"My dear Gilbert,\" said she, \"I wish you wouldn't do so! You know how\ndeeply I have your advantage at heart, how I love you and prize you\nabove everything else in the world, and how much I long to see you well\nsettled in life\u2014and how bitterly it would grieve me to see you married\nto that girl\u2014or any other in the neighbourhood. What you _see_ in her I\ndon't know. It isn't only the want of money that I think about\u2014nothing\nof the kind\u2014but there's neither beauty, nor cleverness, nor goodness,\nnor anything else that's desirable. If you knew your own value, as I\ndo, you wouldn't dream of it. Do wait awhile and see! If you bind\nyourself to her, you'll repent it all your lifetime when you look round\nand see how many better there are. Take my word for it, you will.\"\n\"Well, mother, do be quiet!\u2014I hate to be lectured!\u2014I'm not going to\nmarry yet, I tell you; but\u2014dear me! mayn't I enjoy myself at _all?_\"\n\"Yes, my dear boy, but not in that way. Indeed, you shouldn't do such\nthings. You would be wronging the girl, if she were what she ought to\nbe; but I assure you she is as artful a little hussy as anybody need\nwish to see; and you'll get entangled in her snares before you know\nwhere you are. And if you _do_ marry her, Gilbert, you'll break my\nheart\u2014so there's an end of it.\"\n\"Well, don't cry about it, mother,\" said I, for the tears were gushing\nfrom her eyes; \"there, let that kiss efface the one I gave Eliza; don't\nabuse her any more, and set your mind at rest; for I'll promise\nnever\u2014that is, I'll promise to think twice before I take any important\nstep you seriously disapprove of.\"\nSo saying, I lighted my candle, and went to bed, considerably quenched",

            "text": "It was about the close of the month, that, yielding at length to the\nurgent importunities of Rose, I accompanied her in a visit to Wildfell\nHall. To our surprise, we were ushered into a room where the first\nobject that met the eye was a painter's easel, with a table beside it\ncovered with rolls of canvas, bottles of oil and varnish, palette,\nbrushes, paints, &c. Leaning against the wall were several sketches in\nvarious stages of progression, and a few finished paintings\u2014mostly of\nlandscapes and figures.\n\"I must make you welcome to my studio,\" said Mrs. Graham; \"there is no\nfire in the sitting-room to-day, and it is rather too cold to show you\ninto a place with an empty grate.\"\nAnd disengaging a couple of chairs from the artistical lumber that\nusurped them, she bid us be seated, and resumed her place beside the\neasel\u2014not facing it exactly, but now and then glancing at the picture\nupon it while she conversed, and giving it an occasional touch with her\nbrush, as if she found it impossible to wean her attention entirely\nfrom her occupation to fix it upon her guests. It was a view of\nWildfell Hall, as seen at early morning from the field below, rising in\ndark relief against a sky of clear silvery blue, with a few red streaks\non the horizon, faithfully drawn and coloured, and very elegantly and\nartistically handled.\n\"I see your heart is in your work, Mrs. Graham,\" observed I: \"I must\nbeg you to go on with it; for if you suffer our presence to interrupt\nyou, we shall be constrained to regard ourselves as unwelcome\nintruders.\"\n\"Oh, no!\" replied she, throwing her brush on to the table, as if\nstartled into politeness. \"I am not so beset with visitors but that I\ncan readily spare a few minutes to the few that do favour me with their\ncompany.\"\n\"You have almost completed your painting,\" said I, approaching to\nobserve it more closely, and surveying it with a greater degree of\nadmiration and delight than I cared to express. \"A few more touches in\nthe foreground will finish it, I should think. But why have you called\nit Fernley Manor, Cumberland, instead of Wildfell Hall, \u2014\u2014shire?\" I\nasked, alluding to the name she had traced in small characters at the\nbottom of the canvas.\nBut immediately I was sensible of having committed an act of\nimpertinence in so doing; for she coloured and hesitated; but after a\nmoment's pause, with a kind of desperate frankness, she replied:\u2014\n\"Because I have friends\u2014acquaintances at least\u2014in the world, from whom\nI desire my present abode to be concealed; and as they might see the\npicture, and might possibly recognise the style in spite of the false\ninitials I have put in the corner, I take the precaution to give a\nfalse name to the place also, in order to put them on a wrong scent, if\nthey should attempt to trace me out by it.\"\n\"Then you don't intend to keep the picture?\" said I, anxious to say\nanything to change the subject.\n\"No; I cannot afford to paint for my own amusement.\"\n\"Mamma sends all her pictures to London,\" said Arthur; \"and somebody\nsells them for her there, and sends us the money.\"\nIn looking round upon the other pieces, I remarked a pretty sketch of\nLindenhope from the top of the hill; another view of the old hall\nbasking in the sunny haze of a quiet summer afternoon; and a simple but\nstriking little picture of a child brooding, with looks of silent but\ndeep and sorrowful regret, over a handful of withered flowers, with\nglimpses of dark low hills and autumnal fields behind it, and a dull\nbeclouded sky above.\n\"You see there is a sad dearth of subjects,\" observed the fair artist.\n\"I took the old hall once on a moonlight night, and I suppose I must\ntake it again on a snowy winter's day, and then again on a dark cloudy\nevening; for I really have nothing else to paint. I have been told that\nyou have a fine view of the sea somewhere in the neighbourhood. Is it\ntrue?\u2014and is it within walking distance?\"\n\"Yes, if you don't object to walking four miles\u2014or nearly so\u2014little\nshort of eight miles, there and back\u2014and over a somewhat rough,\nfatiguing road.\"\n\"In what direction does it lie?\"\nI described the situation as well as I could, and was entering upon an\nexplanation of the various roads, lanes, and fields to be traversed in\norder to reach it, the goings straight on, and turnings to the right\nand the left, when she checked me with,\u2014\n\"Oh, stop! don't tell me now: I shall forget every word of your\ndirections before I require them. I shall not think about going till\nnext spring; and then, perhaps, I may trouble you. At present we have\nthe winter before us, and\u2014\"\nShe suddenly paused, with a suppressed exclamation, started up from her\nseat, and saying, \"Excuse me one moment,\" hurried from the room, and\nshut the door behind her.\nCurious to see what had startled her so, I looked towards the\nwindow\u2014for her eyes had been carelessly fixed upon it the moment\nbefore\u2014and just beheld the skirts of a man's coat vanishing behind a\nlarge holly-bush that stood between the window and the porch.\n\"It's mamma's friend,\" said Arthur.\nRose and I looked at each other.\n\"I don't know what to make of her at all,\" whispered Rose.\nThe child looked at her in grave surprise. She straightway began to\ntalk to him on indifferent matters, while I amused myself with looking\nat the pictures. There was one in an obscure corner that I had not\nbefore observed. It was a little child, seated on the grass with its\nlap full of flowers. The tiny features and large blue eyes, smiling\nthrough a shock of light brown curls, shaken over the forehead as it\nbent above its treasure, bore sufficient resemblance to those of the\nyoung gentleman before me to proclaim it a portrait of Arthur Graham in\nhis early infancy.\nIn taking this up to bring it to the light, I discovered another behind\nit, with its face to the wall. I ventured to take that up too. It was\nthe portrait of a gentleman in the full prime of youthful\nmanhood\u2014handsome enough, and not badly executed; but if done by the\nsame hand as the others, it was evidently some years before; for there\nwas far more careful minuteness of detail, and less of that freshness\nof colouring and freedom of handling that delighted and surprised me in\nthem. Nevertheless, I surveyed it with considerable interest. There was\na certain individuality in the features and expression that stamped it,\nat once, a successful likeness. The bright blue eyes regarded the\nspectator with a kind of lurking drollery\u2014you almost expected to see\nthem wink; the lips\u2014a little too voluptuously full\u2014seemed ready to\nbreak into a smile; the warmly-tinted cheeks were embellished with a\nluxuriant growth of reddish whiskers; while the bright chestnut hair,\nclustering in abundant, wavy curls, trespassed too much upon the\nforehead, and seemed to intimate that the owner thereof was prouder of\nhis beauty than his intellect\u2014as, perhaps, he had reason to be; and yet\nhe looked no fool.\nI had not had the portrait in my hands two minutes before the fair\nartist returned.\n\"Only some one come about the pictures,\" said she, in apology for her\nabrupt departure: \"I told him to wait.\"\n\"I fear it will be considered an act of impertinence,\" I said \"to\npresume to look at a picture that the artist has turned to the wall;\nbut may I ask\u2014\"\n\"It _is_ an act of very great impertinence, sir; and therefore I beg\nyou will ask nothing about it, for your curiosity will not be\ngratified,\" replied she, attempting to cover the tartness of her rebuke\nwith a smile; but I could see, by her flushed cheek and kindling eye,\nthat she was seriously annoyed.\n\"I was only going to ask if you had painted it yourself,\" said I,\nsulkily resigning the picture into her hands; for without a grain of\nceremony she took it from me; and quickly restoring it to the dark\ncorner, with its face to the wall, placed the other against it as\nbefore, and then turned to me and laughed.\nBut I was in no humour for jesting. I carelessly turned to the window,\nand stood looking out upon the desolate garden, leaving her to talk to\nRose for a minute or two; and then, telling my sister it was time to\ngo, shook hands with the little gentleman, coolly bowed to the lady,\nand moved towards the door. But, having bid adieu to Rose, Mrs. Graham\npresented her hand to me, saying, with a soft voice, and by no means a\ndisagreeable smile,\u2014\"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, Mr.\nMarkham. I'm sorry I offended you by my abruptness.\"\nWhen a lady condescends to apologise, there is no keeping one's anger,\nof course; so we parted good friends for once; and _this_ time I\nsqueezed her hand with a cordial, not a spiteful pressure.",

I was rather in want of amusement, and so rare\nan opportunity was not to be neglected; so, leaving both meadow and\nhedge, I quickly repaired to the spot, but not before Sancho, who,\nimmediately upon perceiving his young friend, scoured at full gallop\nthe intervening space, and pounced upon him with an impetuous mirth\nthat precipitated the child almost into the middle of the beck; but,\nhappily, the stones preserved him from any serious wetting, while their\nsmoothness prevented his being too much hurt to laugh at the untoward\nevent.\nMrs. Graham was studying the distinctive characters of the different\nvarieties of trees in their winter nakedness, and copying, with a\nspirited, though delicate touch, their various ramifications. She did\nnot talk much, but I stood and watched the progress of her pencil: it\nwas a pleasure to behold it so dexterously guided by those fair and\ngraceful fingers. But ere long their dexterity became impaired, they\nbegan to hesitate, to tremble slightly, and make false strokes, and\nthen suddenly came to a pause, while their owner laughingly raised her\nface to mine, and told me that her sketch did not profit by my\nsuperintendence.\n\"Then,\" said I, \"I'll talk to Arthur till you've done.\"\n\"I should like to have a ride, Mr. Markham, if mamma will let me,\" said\nthe child.\n\"What on, my boy?\"\n\"I think there's a horse in that field,\" replied he, pointing to where\nthe strong black mare was pulling the roller.\n\"No, no, Arthur; it's too far,\" objected his mother.\nBut I promised to bring him safe back after a turn or two up and down\nthe meadow; and when she looked at his eager face she smiled and let\nhim go. It was the first time she had even allowed me to take him so\nmuch as half a field's length from her side.\n[Illustration]\nEnthroned upon his monstrous steed, and solemnly proceeding up and down\nthe wide, steep field, he looked the very incarnation of quiet, gleeful\nsatisfaction and delight. The rolling, however, was soon completed; but\nwhen I dismounted the gallant horseman, and restored him to his mother,\nshe seemed rather displeased at my keeping him so long. She had shut up\nher sketch-book, and been, probably, for some minutes impatiently\nwaiting his return.\nIt was now high time to go home, she said, and would have bid me\ngood-evening, but I was not going to leave her yet: I accompanied her\nhalf-way up the hill. She became more sociable, and I was beginning to\nbe very happy; but, on coming within sight of the grim old hall, she\nstood still, and turned towards me while she spoke, as if expecting I\nshould go no further, that the conversation would end here, and I\nshould now take leave and depart\u2014as, indeed, it was time to do, for\n\"the clear, cold eve\" was fast \"declining,\" the sun had set, and the\ngibbous moon was visibly brightening in the pale grey sky; but a\nfeeling almost of compassion riveted me to the spot. It seemed hard to\nleave her to such a lonely, comfortless home. I looked up at it. Silent\nand grim it frowned before us. A faint, red light was gleaming from the\nlower windows of one wing, but all the other windows were in darkness,\nand many exhibited their black, cavernous gulfs, entirely destitute of\nglazing or framework.\n\"Do you not find it a desolate place to live in?\" said I, after a\nmoment of silent contemplation.\n\"I do, sometimes,\" replied she. \"On winter evenings, when Arthur is in\nbed, and I am sitting there alone, hearing the bleak wind moaning round\nme and howling through the ruinous old chambers, no books or\noccupations can repress the dismal thoughts and apprehensions that come\ncrowding in\u2014but it is folly to give way to such weakness, I know. If\nRachel is satisfied with such a life, why should not I?\u2014Indeed, I\ncannot be too thankful for such an asylum, while it is left me.\"\nThe closing sentence was uttered in an under-tone, as if spoken rather\nto herself than to me. She then bid me good-evening and withdrew.",

Then suddenly turning to me, and fixing\nhis shy, hazel eyes upon me with a steady penetrating gaze, he added,\n\"Then you _have_ changed your mind?\"\n\"I can't say that I have exactly. No; I think I hold the same opinion\nrespecting her as before\u2014but slightly ameliorated.\"\n\"Oh!\" He looked round for something else to talk about; and glancing up\nat the moon, made some remark upon the beauty of the evening, which I\ndid not answer, as being irrelevant to the subject.\n\"Lawrence,\" said I, calmly looking him in the face, \"are you in love\nwith Mrs. Graham?\"\nInstead of his being deeply offended at this, as I more than half\nexpected he would, the first start of surprise, at the audacious\nquestion, was followed by a tittering laugh, as if he was highly amused\nat the idea.\n\"_I_ in love with her!\" repeated he. \"What makes you dream of such a\nthing?\"\n\"From the interest you take in the progress of my acquaintance with the\nlady, and the changes of my opinion concerning her, I thought you might\nbe jealous.\"\nHe laughed again. \"Jealous! no. But I thought you were going to marry\nEliza Millward.\"\n\"You thought wrong, then; I am not going to marry either one or the\nother\u2014that I know of\u2014\"\n\"Then I think you'd better let them alone.\"\n\"Are you going to marry Jane Wilson?\"\nHe coloured, and played with the mane again, but answered\u2014\"No, I think\nnot.\"\n\"Then you had better let her alone.\"\n\"She won't let me alone,\" he might have said; but he only looked silly\nand said nothing for the space of half a minute, and then made another\nattempt to turn the conversation; and this time I let it pass; for he\nhad borne enough: another word on the subject would have been like the\nlast atom that breaks the camel's back.",

It's always so\u2014if there's anything\nparticularly nice at table, mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from\nit, and if I don't attend to that, she whispers, 'Don't eat so much of\nthat, Rose; Gilbert will like it for his supper.'\u2014_I'm_ nothing at all.\nIn the parlour, it's 'Come, Rose, put away your things, and let's have\nthe room nice and tidy against they come in; and keep up a good fire;\nGilbert likes a cheerful fire.' In the kitchen\u2014'Make that pie a large\none, Rose; I daresay the boys'll be hungry; and don't put so much\npepper in, they'll not like it, I'm sure'\u2014or, 'Rose, don't put so many\nspices in the pudding, Gilbert likes it plain,'\u2014or, 'Mind you put\nplenty of currants in the cake, Fergus liked plenty.' If I say, 'Well,\nMamma, _I_ don't,' I'm told I ought not to think of myself. 'You know,\nRose, in all household matters, we have only two things to consider,\nfirst, what's proper to be done; and, secondly, what's most agreeable\nto the gentlemen of the house\u2014anything will do for the ladies.'\"\n\"And very good doctrine too,\" said my mother. \"Gilbert thinks so, I'm\nsure.\"\n\"Very convenient doctrine, for us, at all events,\" said I; \"but if you\nwould really study my pleasure, mother, you must consider your own\ncomfort and convenience a little more than you do\u2014as for Rose, I have\nno doubt she'll take care of herself; and whenever she does make a\nsacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness, she'll take good\ncare to let me know the extent of it. But for _you_, I might sink into\nthe grossest condition of self-indulgence and carelessness about the\nwants of others, from the mere habit of being constantly cared for\nmyself, and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied,\nwhile left in total ignorance of what is done for me,\u2014if Rose did not\nenlighten me now and then; and I should receive all your kindness as a\nmatter of course, and never know how much I owe you.\"\n\"Ah! and you never _will_ know, Gilbert, till you're married. Then,\nwhen you've got some trifling, self-conceited girl like Eliza Millward,\ncareless of everything but her own immediate pleasure and advantage, or\nsome misguided, obstinate woman, like Mrs. Graham, ignorant of her\nprincipal duties, and clever only in what concerns her least to\nknow\u2014then you'll find the difference.\"\n\"It will do me good, mother; I was not sent into the world merely to\nexercise the good capacities and good feelings of others\u2014was I?\u2014but to\nexert my own towards them; and when I marry, I shall expect to find\nmore pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable, than in being\nmade so by her: I would rather give than receive.\"\n\"Oh! that's all nonsense, my dear. It's mere boy's talk that! You'll\nsoon tire of petting and humouring your wife, be she ever so charming,\nand _then_ comes the trial.\"\n\"Well, then, we must bear one another's burdens.\"\n\"Then you must fall each into your proper place. You'll do your\nbusiness, and she, if she's worthy of you, will do hers; but it's your\nbusiness to please yourself, and hers to please you. I'm sure your\npoor, dear father was as good a husband as ever lived, and after the\nfirst six months or so were over, I should as soon have expected him to\nfly, as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me. He always said I\nwas a good wife, and did my duty; and he always did his\u2014bless him!\u2014he\nwas steady and punctual, seldom found fault without a reason, always\ndid justice to my good dinners, and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by\ndelay\u2014and that's as much as any woman can expect of any man.\"\nIs it so, Halford? Is that the extent of _your_ domestic virtues; and\ndoes your happy wife exact no more?",

If you couldn't\nafford to occupy the whole house, and have it mended up, why couldn't\nyou take a neat little cottage?\"\n\"Perhaps I was too proud, Mr. Fergus,\" replied she, smiling; \"perhaps I\ntook a particular fancy for this romantic, old-fashioned place\u2014but,\nindeed, it has many advantages over a cottage\u2014in the first place, you\nsee, the rooms are larger and more airy; in the second place, the\nunoccupied apartments, which I don't pay for, may serve as\nlumber-rooms, if I have anything to put in them; and they are very\nuseful for my little boy to run about in on rainy days when he can't go\nout; and then there is the garden for him to play in, and for me to\nwork in. You see I have effected some little improvement already,\"\ncontinued she, turning to the window. \"There is a bed of young\nvegetables in that corner, and here are some snowdrops and primroses\nalready in bloom\u2014and there, too, is a yellow crocus just opening in the\nsunshine.\"\n\"But then how can you bear such a situation\u2014your nearest neighbours two\nmiles distant, and nobody looking in or passing by? Rose would go stark\nmad in such a place. She can't put on life unless she sees half a dozen\nfresh gowns and bonnets a day\u2014not to speak of the faces within; but you\nmight sit watching at these windows all day long, and never see so much\nas an old woman carrying her eggs to market.\"\n\"I am not sure the loneliness of the place was not one of its chief\nrecommendations. I take no pleasure in watching people pass the\nwindows; and I like to be quiet.\"\n\"Oh! as good as to say you wish we would all of us mind our own\nbusiness, and let you alone.\"\n\"No, I dislike an extensive acquaintance; but if I have a few friends,\nof course I am glad to see them occasionally. No one can be happy in\neternal solitude. Therefore, Mr. Fergus, if you choose to enter my\nhouse as a friend, I will make you welcome; if not, I must confess, I\nwould rather you kept away.\" She then turned and addressed some\nobservation to Rose or Eliza.",

Well, the question, or questions, you are requested to\nsolve\u2014\"\n\"Hold your tongue, Fergus!\" cried Rose, in a fever of apprehension and\nwrath.\n\"I won't, I tell you. The questions you are requested to solve are\nthese:\u2014First, concerning your birth, extraction, and previous\nresidence. Some will have it that you are a foreigner, and some an\nEnglishwoman; some a native of the north country, and some of the\nsouth; some say\u2014\"\n\"Well, Mr. Fergus, I'll tell you. I'm an Englishwoman\u2014and I don't see\nwhy any one should doubt it\u2014and I was born in the country, neither in\nthe extreme north nor south of our happy isle; and in the country I\nhave chiefly passed my life, and now I hope you are satisfied; for I am\nnot disposed to answer any more questions at present.\"\n\"Except this\u2014\"\n\"No, not one more!\" laughed she, and, instantly quitting her seat, she\nsought refuge at the window by which I was seated, and, in very\ndesperation, to escape my brother's persecutions, endeavoured to draw\nme into conversation.\n\"Mr. Markham,\" said she, her rapid utterance and heightened colour too\nplainly evincing her disquietude, \"have you forgotten the fine sea-view\nwe were speaking of some time ago? I think I must trouble you, now, to\ntell me the nearest way to it; for if this beautiful weather continue,\nI shall, perhaps, be able to walk there, and take my sketch; I have\nexhausted every other subject for painting; and I long to see it.\"\nI was about to comply with her request, but Rose would not suffer me to\nproceed.\n\"Oh, don't tell her, Gilbert!\" cried she; \"she shall go with us. It's\n\u2014\u2014 Bay you are thinking about, I suppose, Mrs. Graham? It is a very\nlong walk, too far for you, and out of the question for Arthur. But we\nwere thinking about making a picnic to see it some fine day; and, if\nyou will wait till the settled fine weather comes, I'm sure we shall\nall be delighted to have you amongst us.\"\nPoor Mrs. Graham looked dismayed, and attempted to make excuses, but\nRose, either compassionating her lonely life, or anxious to cultivate\nher acquaintance, was determined to have her; and every objection was\noverruled. She was told it would only be a small party, and all\nfriends, and that the best view of all was from \u2014\u2014 Cliffs, full five\nmiles distant.\n\"Just a nice walk for the gentlemen,\" continued Rose; \"but the ladies\nwill drive and walk by turns; for we shall have our pony-carriage,\nwhich will be plenty large enough to contain little Arthur and three\nladies, together with your sketching apparatus, and our provisions.\"\nSo the proposal was finally acceded to; and, after some further\ndiscussion respecting the time and manner of the projected excursion,\nwe rose, and took our leave.",

When I did so, he hesitated, and asked who were\ngoing. Upon my naming Miss Wilson among the rest, he seemed half\ninclined to go, but when I mentioned Mrs. Graham, thinking it might be\na further inducement, it appeared to have a contrary effect, and he\ndeclined it altogether, and, to confess the truth, the decision was not\ndispleasing to me, though I could scarcely tell you why.\nIt was about midday when we reached the place of our destination. Mrs.\nGraham walked all the way to the cliffs; and little Arthur walked the\ngreater part of it too; for he was now much more hardy and active than\nwhen he first entered the neighbourhood, and he did not like being in\nthe carriage with strangers, while all his four friends, mamma, and\nSancho, and Mr. Markham, and Miss Millward, were on foot, journeying\nfar behind, or passing through distant fields and lanes.\nI have a very pleasant recollection of that walk, along the hard,\nwhite, sunny road, shaded here and there with bright green trees, and\nadorned with flowery banks and blossoming hedges of delicious\nfragrance; or through pleasant fields and lanes, all glorious in the\nsweet flowers and brilliant verdure of delightful May. It was true,\nEliza was not beside me; but she was with her friends in the\npony-carriage, as happy, I trusted, as I was; and even when we\npedestrians, having forsaken the highway for a short cut across the\nfields, beheld the little carriage far away, disappearing amid the\ngreen, embowering trees, I did not hate those trees for snatching the\ndear little bonnet and shawl from my sight, nor did I feel that all\nthose intervening objects lay between my happiness and me; for, to\nconfess the truth, I was too happy in the company of Mrs. Graham to\nregret the absence of Eliza Millward.\nThe former, it is true, was most provokingly unsociable at\nfirst\u2014seemingly bent upon talking to no one but Mary Millward and\nArthur. She and Mary journeyed along together, generally with the child\nbetween them;\u2014but where the road permitted, I always walked on the\nother side of her, Richard Wilson taking the other side of Miss\nMillward, and Fergus roving here and there according to his fancy; and,\nafter a while, she became more friendly, and at length I succeeded in\nsecuring her attention almost entirely to myself\u2014and then I was happy\nindeed; for whenever she did condescend to converse, I liked to listen.\nWhere her opinions and sentiments tallied with mine, it was her extreme\ngood sense, her exquisite taste and feeling, that delighted me; where\nthey differed, it was still her uncompromising boldness in the avowal\nor defence of that difference, her earnestness and keenness, that\npiqued my fancy: and even when she angered me by her unkind words or\nlooks, and her uncharitable conclusions respecting me, it only made me\nthe more dissatisfied with myself for having so unfavourably impressed\nher, and the more desirous to vindicate my character and disposition in\nher eyes, and, if possible, to win her esteem.\nAt length our walk was ended.

I didn't know it was you.\u2014Why did you startle me so?\" said she,\nsomewhat testily. \"I hate anybody to come upon me so unexpectedly.\"\n\"Why, what did you take me for?\" said I: \"if I had known you were so\nnervous, I would have been more cautious; but\u2014\"\n\"Well, never mind.

I'll only sit and watch your drawing.\"\n\"Oh, but you know I don't like that.\"\n\"Then I'll content myself with admiring this magnificent prospect.\"\nShe made no objection to this; and, for some time, sketched away in\nsilence. But I could not help stealing a glance, now and then, from the\nsplendid view at our feet to the elegant white hand that held the\npencil, and the graceful neck and glossy raven curls that drooped over\nthe paper.\n\"Now,\" thought I, \"if I had but a pencil and a morsel of paper, I could\nmake a lovelier sketch than hers, admitting I had the power to\ndelineate faithfully what is before me.\"\nBut, though this satisfaction was denied me, I was very well content to\nsit beside her there, and say nothing.\n\"Are you there still, Mr. Markham?\" said she at length, looking round\nupon me\u2014for I was seated a little behind on a mossy projection of the\ncliff.\u2014\"Why don't you go and amuse yourself with your friends?\"\n\"Because I am tired of them, like you; and I shall have enough of them\nto-morrow\u2014or at any time hence; but you I may not have the pleasure of\nseeing again for I know not how long.\"\n\"What was Arthur doing when you came away?\"\n\"He was with Miss Millward, where you left him\u2014all right, but hoping\nmamma would not be long away. You didn't intrust him to me, by-the-by,\"\nI grumbled, \"though I had the honour of a much longer acquaintance; but\nMiss Millward has the art of conciliating and amusing children,\" I\ncarelessly added, \"if she is good for nothing else.\"\n\"Miss Millward has many estimable qualities, which such as you cannot\nbe expected to perceive or appreciate.

My opinion,\nhappily, met her approbation, and the improvement I suggested was\nadopted without hesitation.\n\"I have often wished in vain,\" said she, \"for another's judgment to\nappeal to when I could scarcely trust the direction of my own eye and\nhead, they having been so long occupied with the contemplation of a\nsingle object as to become almost incapable of forming a proper idea\nrespecting it.\"\n\"That,\" replied I, \"is only one of many evils to which a solitary life\nexposes us.\"\n\"True,\" said she; and again we relapsed into silence.\nAbout two minutes after, however, she declared her sketch completed,\nand closed the book.\nOn returning to the scene of our repast we found all the company had\ndeserted it, with the exception of three\u2014Mary Millward, Richard Wilson,\nand Arthur Graham. The younger gentleman lay fast asleep with his head\npillowed on the lady's lap; the other was seated beside her with a\npocket edition of some classic author in his hand. He never went\nanywhere without such a companion wherewith to improve his leisure\nmoments: all time seemed lost that was not devoted to study, or\nexacted, by his physical nature, for the bare support of life. Even now\nhe could not abandon himself to the enjoyment of that pure air and\nbalmy sunshine\u2014that splendid prospect, and those soothing sounds, the\nmusic of the waves and of the soft wind in the sheltering trees above\nhim\u2014not even with a lady by his side (though not a very charming one, I\nwill allow)\u2014he must pull out his book, and make the most of his time\nwhile digesting his temperate meal, and reposing his weary limbs,\nunused to so much exercise.\nPerhaps, however, he spared a moment to exchange a word or a glance\nwith his companion now and then\u2014at any rate, she did not appear at all\nresentful of his conduct; for her homely features wore an expression of\nunusual cheerfulness and serenity, and she was studying his pale,\nthoughtful face with great complacency when we arrived.\nThe journey homeward was by no means so agreeable to me as the former\npart of the day: for now Mrs. Graham was in the carriage, and Eliza\nMillward was the companion of my walk. She had observed my preference\nfor the young widow, and evidently felt herself neglected. She did not\nmanifest her chagrin by keen reproaches, bitter sarcasms, or pouting\nsullen silence\u2014any or all of these I could easily have endured, or\nlightly laughed away; but she showed it by a kind of gentle melancholy,\na mild, reproachful sadness that cut me to the heart. I tried to cheer\nher up, and apparently succeeded in some degree, before the walk was\nover; but in the very act my conscience reproved me, knowing, as I did,\nthat, sooner or later, the tie must be broken, and this was only\nnourishing false hopes and putting off the evil day.\nWhen the pony-carriage had approached as near Wildfell Hall as the road\nwould permit\u2014unless, indeed, it proceeded up the long rough lane, which\nMrs. Graham would not allow\u2014the young widow and her son alighted,\nrelinquishing the driver's seat to Rose; and I persuaded Eliza to take\nthe latter's place. Having put her comfortably in, bid her take care of\nthe evening air, and wished her a kind good-night, I felt considerably\nrelieved, and hastened to offer my services to Mrs. Graham to carry her\napparatus up the fields, but she had already hung her camp-stool on her\narm and taken her sketch-book in her hand, and insisted upon bidding me\nadieu then and there, with the rest of the company. But this time she\ndeclined my proffered aid in so kind and friendly a manner that I\nalmost forgave her.",

This circumstance did not\ngreatly disconcert me, however, because I attributed it, not so much to\nany dislike of my person, as to some absolute resolution against a\nsecond marriage formed prior to the time of our acquaintance, whether\nfrom excess of affection for her late husband, or because she had had\nenough of him and the matrimonial state together. At first, indeed, she\nhad seemed to take a pleasure in mortifying my vanity and crushing my\npresumption\u2014relentlessly nipping off bud by bud as they ventured to\nappear; and then, I confess, I was deeply wounded, though, at the same\ntime, stimulated to seek revenge;\u2014but latterly finding, beyond a doubt,\nthat I was not that empty-headed coxcomb she had first supposed me, she\nhad repulsed my modest advances in quite a different spirit. It was a\nkind of serious, almost sorrowful displeasure, which I soon learnt\ncarefully to avoid awakening.\n\"Let me first establish my position as a friend,\" thought I\u2014\"the patron\nand playfellow of her son, the sober, solid, plain-dealing friend of\nherself, and then, when I have made myself fairly necessary to her\ncomfort and enjoyment in life (as I believe I can), we'll see what next\nmay be effected.\"\nSo we talked about painting, poetry, and music, theology, geology, and\nphilosophy: once or twice I lent her a book, and once she lent me one\nin return: I met her in her walks as often as I could; I came to her\nhouse as often as I dared. My first pretext for invading the sanctum\nwas to bring Arthur a little waddling puppy of which Sancho was the\nfather, and which delighted the child beyond expression, and,\nconsequently, could not fail to please his mamma. My second was to\nbring him a book, which, knowing his mother's particularity, I had\ncarefully selected, and which I submitted for her approbation before\npresenting it to him. Then, I brought her some plants for her garden,\nin my sister's name\u2014having previously persuaded Rose to send them. Each\nof these times I inquired after the picture she was painting from the\nsketch taken on the cliff, and was admitted into the studio, and asked\nmy opinion or advice respecting its progress.\nMy last visit had been to return the book she had lent me; and then it\nwas that, in casually discussing the poetry of Sir Walter Scott, she\nhad expressed a wish to see \"Marmion,\" and I had conceived the\npresumptuous idea of making her a present of it, and, on my return\nhome, instantly sent for the smart little volume I had this morning\nreceived. But an apology for invading the hermitage was still\nnecessary; so I had furnished myself with a blue morocco collar for\nArthur's little dog; and that being given and received, with much more\njoy and gratitude, on the part of the receiver, than the worth of the\ngift or the selfish motive of the giver deserved, I ventured to ask\nMrs. Graham for one more look at the picture, if it was still there.\n\"Oh, yes! come in,\" said she (for I had met them in the garden). \"It is\nfinished and framed, all ready for sending away; but give me your last\nopinion, and if you can suggest any further improvement, it shall\nbe\u2014duly considered, at least.\"\nThe picture was strikingly beautiful; it was the very scene itself,\ntransferred as if by magic to the canvas; but I expressed my\napprobation in guarded terms, and few words, for fear of displeasing\nher. She, however, attentively watched my looks, and her artist's pride\nwas gratified, no doubt, to read my heartfelt admiration in my eyes.\nBut, while I gazed, I thought upon the book, and wondered how it was to\nbe presented. My heart failed me; but I determined not to be such a\nfool as to come away without having made the attempt. It was useless\nwaiting for an opportunity, and useless trying to concoct a speech for\nthe occasion. The more plainly and naturally the thing was done, the\nbetter, I thought; so I just looked out of the window to screw up my\ncourage, and then pulled out the book, turned round, and put it into\nher hand, with this short explanation:\n\"You were wishing to see \"Marmion,\" Mrs. Graham; and here it is, if you",

But when I\ncalled there the day after my interview with Mrs. Graham, he happened\nto be from home\u2014a circumstance by no means so agreeable to me now as it\nhad been on former occasions. Miss Millward was there, it is true, but\nshe, of course, would be little better than a nonentity.

I only wish\nyou may not find your confidence misplaced.\"\nAnd she raised her face, and gave me such a look of sorrowful\ntenderness as might have melted my heart, but within those eyes there\nlurked a something that I did not like; and I wondered how I ever could\nhave admired them\u2014her sister's honest face and small grey optics\nappeared far more agreeable. But I was out of temper with Eliza at that\nmoment for her insinuations against Mrs. Graham, which were false, I\nwas certain, whether she knew it or not.\nI said nothing more on the subject, however, at the time, and but\nlittle on any other; for, finding I could not well recover my\nequanimity, I presently rose and took leave, excusing myself under the\nplea of business at the farm; and to the farm I went, not troubling my\nmind one whit about the possible truth of these mysterious reports, but\nonly wondering what they were, by whom originated, and on what\nfoundations raised, and how they could the most effectually be silenced\nor disproved.",

A slight bow was all that passed between them on his\nentrance; and having politely greeted the other members of the company,\nhe seated himself quite aloof from the young widow, between my mother\nand Rose.\n\"Did you ever see such art?\" whispered Eliza, who was my nearest\nneighbour. \"Would you not say they were perfect strangers?\"\n\"Almost; but what then?\"\n\"What then; why, you can't pretend to be ignorant?\"\n\"Ignorant of _what?_\" demanded I, so sharply that she started and\nreplied,\u2014\n\"Oh, hush! don't speak so loud.\"\n\"Well, tell me then,\" I answered in a lower tone, \"what is it you mean?\nI hate enigmas.\"\n\"Well, you know, I don't vouch for the truth of it\u2014indeed, far from\nit\u2014but haven't you heard\u2014?\"\n\"I've heard _nothing_, except from you.\"\n\"You must be wilfully deaf then, for anyone will tell you that; but I\nshall only anger you by repeating it, I see, so I had better hold my\ntongue.\"\nShe closed her lips and folded her hands before her, with an air of\ninjured meekness.\n\"If you had wished not to anger me, you should have held your tongue\nfrom the beginning, or else spoken out plainly and honestly all you had\nto say.\"\nShe turned aside her face, pulled out her handkerchief, rose, and went\nto the window, where she stood for some time, evidently dissolved in\ntears. I was astounded, provoked, ashamed\u2014not so much of my harshness\nas for her childish weakness. However, no one seemed to notice her, and\nshortly after we were summoned to the tea-table: in those parts it was\ncustomary to sit to the table at tea-time on all occasions, and make a\nmeal of it, for we dined early. On taking my seat, I had Rose on one\nside of me and an empty chair on the other.\n\"May I sit by you?\" said a soft voice at my elbow.\n\"If you like,\" was the reply; and Eliza slipped into the vacant chair;\nthen, looking up in my face with a half-sad, half-playful smile, she\nwhispered,\u2014\"You're so stern, Gilbert.\"\nI handed down her tea with a slightly contemptuous smile, and said\nnothing, for I had nothing to say.\n\"What have I done to offend you?\" said she, more plaintively. \"I wish I\nknew.\"\n\"Come, take your tea, Eliza, and don't be foolish,\" responded I,\nhanding her the sugar and cream.\nJust then there arose a slight commotion on the other side of me,\noccasioned by Miss Wilson's coming to negotiate an exchange of seats\nwith Rose.\n\"Will you be so good as to exchange places with me, Miss Markham?\" said\nshe; \"for I don't like to sit by Mrs. Graham. If your mamma thinks\nproper to invite such persons to her house, she cannot object to her\ndaughter's keeping company with them.\"\nThis latter clause was added in a sort of soliloquy when Rose was gone;\nbut I was not polite enough to let it pass.\n\"Will you be so good as to tell me what you mean, Miss Wilson?\" said I.\nThe question startled her a little, but not much.\n\"Why, Mr. Markham,\" replied she, coolly, having quickly recovered her\nself-possession, \"it surprises me rather that Mrs. Markham should\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Graham to her house; but, perhaps, she is\nnot aware that the lady's character is considered scarcely\nrespectable.\"\n\"She is not, nor am I; and therefore you would oblige me by explaining\nyour meaning a little further.\"\n\"This is scarcely the time or the place for such explanations; but I\nthink you can hardly be so ignorant as you pretend\u2014you must know her as\nwell as I do.\"\n\"I think I do, perhaps a little better; and therefore, if you will\ninform me what you have heard or imagined against her, I shall,\nperhaps, be able to set you right.\"\n\"Can you tell me, then, who was her husband, or if she ever had any?\"\nIndignation kept me silent. At such a time and place I could not trust\nmyself to answer.\n\"Have you never observed,\" said Eliza, \"what a striking likeness there\nis between that child of hers and\u2014\"\n\"And whom?\" demanded Miss Wilson, with an air of cold, but keen\nseverity.\nEliza was startled; the timidly spoken suggestion had been intended for\nmy ear alone.\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" pleaded she; \"I may be mistaken\u2014perhaps I\n_was_ mistaken.\" But she accompanied the words with a sly glance of\nderision directed to me from the corner of her disingenuous eye.\n\"There's no need to ask _my_ pardon,\" replied her friend, \"but I see no\none here that at all resembles that child, except his mother, and when\nyou hear ill-natured reports, Miss Eliza, I will thank you, that is, I\nthink you will do well, to refrain from repeating them. I presume the\nperson you allude to is Mr. Lawrence; but I think I can assure you that\nyour suspicions, in that respect, are utterly misplaced; and if he has\nany particular connection with the lady at all (which no one has a\nright to assert), at least he has (what cannot be said of some others)\nsufficient sense of propriety to withhold him from acknowledging\nanything more than a bowing acquaintance in the presence of respectable\npersons; he was evidently both surprised and annoyed to find her here.\"\n\"Go it!\" cried Fergus, who sat on the other side of Eliza, and was the\nonly individual who shared that side of the table with us. \"Go it like\nbricks! mind you don't leave her one stone upon another.\"\nMiss Wilson drew herself up with a look of freezing scorn, but said\nnothing. Eliza would have replied, but I interrupted her by saying as\ncalmly as I could, though in a tone which betrayed, no doubt, some\nlittle of what I felt within,\u2014\"We have had enough of this subject; if\nwe can only speak to slander our betters, let us hold our tongues.\"\n\"I think you'd better,\" observed Fergus, \"and so does our good parson;\nhe has been addressing the company in his richest vein all the while,\nand eyeing you, from time to time, with looks of stern distaste, while\nyou sat there, irreverently whispering and muttering together; and once\nhe paused in the middle of a story or a sermon, I don't know which, and\nfixed his eyes upon you, Gilbert, as much as to say, 'When Mr. Markham\nhas done flirting with those two ladies I will proceed.'\"\nWhat more was said at the tea-table I cannot tell, nor how I found\npatience to sit till the meal was over. I remember, however, that I\nswallowed with difficulty the remainder of the tea that was in my cup,\nand ate nothing; and that the first thing I did was to stare at Arthur\nGraham, who sat beside his mother on the opposite side of the table,\nand the second to stare at Mr. Lawrence, who sat below; and, first, it\nstruck me that there _was_ a likeness; but, on further contemplation, I\nconcluded it was only in imagination.\nBoth, it is true, had more delicate features and smaller bones than\ncommonly fall to the lot of individuals of the rougher sex, and\nLawrence's complexion was pale and clear, and Arthur's delicately fair;\nbut Arthur's tiny, somewhat snubby nose could never become so long and\nstraight as Mr. Lawrence's; and the outline of his face, though not\nfull enough to be round, and too finely converging to the small,\ndimpled chin to be square, could never be drawn out to the long oval of\nthe other's, while the child's hair was evidently of a lighter, warmer\ntint than the elder gentleman's had ever been, and his large, clear\nblue eyes, though prematurely serious at times, were utterly dissimilar\nto the shy hazel eyes of Mr. Lawrence, whence the sensitive soul looked\nso distrustfully forth, as ever ready to retire within, from the\noffences of a too rude, too uncongenial world. Wretch that I was to\nharbour that detestable idea for a moment! Did I not know Mrs. Graham?\nHad I not seen her, conversed with her time after time? Was I not\ncertain that she, in intellect, in purity and elevation of soul, was\nimmeasurably superior to any of her detractors; that she was, in fact,\nthe noblest, the most adorable, of her sex I had ever beheld, or even\nimagined to exist? Yes, and I would say with Mary Millward (sensible\ngirl as she was), that if all the parish, ay, or all the world, should\ndin these horrible lies in my ears, I would not believe them, for I\nknew her better than they.\nMeantime, my brain was on fire with indignation, and my heart seemed\nready to burst from its prison with conflicting passions. I regarded my\ntwo fair neighbours with a feeling of abhorrence and loathing I\nscarcely endeavoured to conceal. I was rallied from several quarters\nfor my abstraction and ungallant neglect of the ladies; but I cared\nlittle for that: all I cared about, besides that one grand subject of\nmy thoughts, was to see the cups travel up to the tea-tray, and not\ncome down again. I thought Mr. Millward never _would_ cease telling us\nthat he was no tea-drinker, and that it was highly injurious to keep\nloading the stomach with slops to the exclusion of more wholesome\nsustenance, and so give himself time to finish his fourth cup.\nAt length it was over; and I rose and left the table and the guests",

            "text": "without a word of apology\u2014I could endure their company no longer. I\nrushed out to cool my brain in the balmy evening air, and to compose my\nmind or indulge my passionate thoughts in the solitude of the garden.\nTo avoid being seen from the windows I went down a quiet little avenue\nthat skirted one side of the inclosure, at the bottom of which was a\nseat embowered in roses and honeysuckles. Here I sat down to think over\nthe virtues and wrongs of the lady of Wildfell Hall; but I had not been\nso occupied two minutes, before voices and laughter, and glimpses of\nmoving objects through the trees, informed me that the whole company\nhad turned out to take an airing in the garden too. However, I nestled\nup in a corner of the bower, and hoped to retain possession of it,\nsecure alike from observation and intrusion. But no\u2014confound it\u2014there\nwas some one coming down the avenue! Why couldn't they enjoy the\nflowers and sunshine of the open garden, and leave that sunless nook to\nme, and the gnats and midges?\nBut, peeping through my fragrant screen of the interwoven branches to\ndiscover who the intruders were (for a murmur of voices told me it was\nmore than one), my vexation instantly subsided, and far other feelings\nagitated my still unquiet soul; for there was Mrs. Graham, slowly\nmoving down the walk with Arthur by her side, and no one else. Why were\nthey alone? Had the poison of detracting tongues already spread through\nall; and had they all turned their backs upon her? I now recollected\nhaving seen Mrs. Wilson, in the early part of the evening, edging her\nchair close up to my mother, and bending forward, evidently in the\ndelivery of some important confidential intelligence; and from the\nincessant wagging of her head, the frequent distortions of her wrinkled\nphysiognomy, and the winking and malicious twinkle of her little ugly\neyes, I judged it was some spicy piece of scandal that engaged her\npowers; and from the cautious privacy of the communication I supposed\nsome person then present was the luckless object of her calumnies: and\nfrom all these tokens, together with my mother's looks and gestures of\nmingled horror and incredulity, I now concluded that object to have\nbeen Mrs. Graham. I did not emerge from my place of concealment till\nshe had nearly reached the bottom of the walk, lest my appearance\nshould drive her away; and when I did step forward she stood still and\nseemed inclined to turn back as it was.\n\"Oh, don't let us disturb you, Mr. Markham!\" said she. \"We came here to\nseek retirement ourselves, not to intrude on your seclusion.\"\n\"I am no hermit, Mrs. Graham\u2014though I own it looks rather like it to\nabsent myself in this uncourteous fashion from my guests.\"\n\"I feared you were unwell,\" said she, with a look of real concern.\n\"I was rather, but it's over now. Do sit here a little and rest, and\ntell me how you like this arbour,\" said I, and, lifting Arthur by the\nshoulders, I planted him in the middle of the seat by way of securing\nhis mamma, who, acknowledging it to be a tempting place of refuge,\nthrew herself back in one corner, while I took possession of the other.\nBut that word refuge disturbed me. Had their unkindness then really\ndriven her to seek for peace in solitude?\n\"Why have they left you alone?\" I asked.\n\"It is I who have left them,\" was the smiling rejoinder. \"I was wearied\nto death with small talk\u2014nothing wears me out like that. I cannot\nimagine how they _can_ go on as they do.\"\nI could not help smiling at the serious depth of her wonderment.\n\"Is it that they think it a _duty_ to be continually talking,\" pursued\nshe: \"and so never pause to think, but fill up with aimless trifles and\nvain repetitions when subjects of real interest fail to present\nthemselves, or do they really take a pleasure in such discourse?\"\n\"Very likely they do,\" said I; \"their shallow minds can hold no great\nideas, and their light heads are carried away by trivialities that\nwould not move a better-furnished skull; and their only alternative to\nsuch discourse is to plunge over head and ears into the slough of\nscandal\u2014which is their chief delight.\"\n\"Not all of them, surely?\" cried the lady, astonished at the bitterness\nof my remark.\n\"No, certainly; I exonerate my sister from such degraded tastes, and my\nmother too, if you included _her_ in your animadversions.\"\n\"I meant no animadversions against any one, and certainly intended no\ndisrespectful allusions to your mother. I have known some sensible\npersons great adepts in that style of conversation when circumstances\nimpelled them to it; but it is a gift I cannot boast the possession of.\nI kept up my attention on this occasion as long as I could, but when my\npowers were exhausted I stole away to seek a few minutes' repose in\nthis quiet walk. I hate talking where there is no exchange of ideas or\nsentiments, and no good given or received.\"\n\"Well,\" said I, \"if ever I trouble you with my loquacity, tell me so at\nonce, and I promise not to be offended; for I possess the faculty of\nenjoying the company of those I\u2014of my friends as well in silence as in\nconversation.\"\n\"I don't quite believe you; but if it were so you would exactly suit me\nfor a companion.\"\n\"I am all you wish, then, in other respects?\"\n\"No, I don't mean that. How beautiful those little clusters of foliage\nlook, where the sun comes through behind them!\" said she, on purpose to\nchange the subject.\nAnd they did look beautiful, where at intervals the level rays of the\nsun penetrating the thickness of trees and shrubs on the opposite side\nof the path before us, relieved their dusky verdure by displaying\npatches of semi-transparent leaves of resplendent golden green.\n\"I almost wish I were not a painter,\" observed my companion.\n\"Why so? one would think at such a time you would most exult in your\nprivilege of being able to imitate the various brilliant and delightful\ntouches of nature.\"\n\"No; for instead of delivering myself up to the full enjoyment of them\nas others do, I am always troubling my head about how I could produce\nthe same effect upon canvas; and as that can never be done, it is mere\nvanity and vexation of spirit.\"\n\"Perhaps you cannot do it to satisfy yourself, but you may and do\nsucceed in delighting others with the result of your endeavours.\"\n\"Well, after all, I should not complain: perhaps few people gain their\nlivelihood with so much pleasure in their toil as I do. Here is some\none coming.\"\nShe seemed vexed at the interruption.\n\"It is only Mr. Lawrence and Miss Wilson,\" said I, \"coming to enjoy a\nquiet stroll. They will not disturb us.\"\nI could not quite decipher the expression of her face; but I was\nsatisfied there was no jealousy therein. What business had I to look\nfor it?\n\"What sort of a person is Miss Wilson?\" she asked.\n\"She is elegant and accomplished above the generality of her birth and\nstation; and some say she is ladylike and agreeable.\"\n\"I thought her somewhat frigid and rather supercilious in her manner\nto-day.\"\n\"Very likely she might be so to you. She has possibly taken a prejudice\nagainst you, for I think she regards you in the light of a rival.\"\n\"Me! Impossible, Mr. Markham!\" said she, evidently astonished and\nannoyed.\n\"Well, I know nothing about it,\" returned I, rather doggedly; for I\nthought her annoyance was chiefly against myself.\nThe pair had now approached within a few paces of us. Our arbour was\nset snugly back in a corner, before which the avenue at its termination\nturned off into the more airy walk along the bottom of the garden. As\nthey approached this, I saw, by the aspect of Jane Wilson, that she was\ndirecting her companion's attention to us; and, as well by her cold,\nsarcastic smile as by the few isolated words of her discourse that\nreached me, I knew full well that she was impressing him with the idea,\nthat we were strongly attached to each other. I noticed that he\ncoloured up to the temples, gave us one furtive glance in passing, and\nwalked on, looking grave, but seemingly offering no reply to her\nremarks.\nIt was true, then, that he _had_ some designs upon Mrs. Graham; and,\nwere they honourable, he would not be so anxious to conceal them. _She_\nwas blameless, of course, but he was detestable beyond all count.\nWhile these thoughts flashed through my mind, my companion abruptly\nrose, and calling her son, said they would now go in quest of the\ncompany, and departed up the avenue. Doubtless she had heard or guessed\nsomething of Miss Wilson's remarks, and therefore it was natural enough\nshe should choose to continue the _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ no longer, especially\nas at that moment my cheeks were burning with indignation against my",

In fact, she would not hear of any one's\nputting himself out of the way to accompany her, though Fergus\nvouchsafed to offer his services in case they should be more acceptable\nthan mine, and my mother begged she might send one of the farming-men\nto escort her.\nWhen she was gone the rest was all a blank or worse. Lawrence attempted\nto draw me into conversation, but I snubbed him and went to another\npart of the room. Shortly after the party broke up and he himself took\nleave. When he came to me I was blind to his extended hand, and deaf to\nhis good-night till he repeated it a second time; and then, to get rid\nof him, I muttered an inarticulate reply, accompanied by a sulky nod.\n\"What is the matter, Markham?\" whispered he.\nI replied by a wrathful and contemptuous stare.\n\"Are you angry because Mrs. Graham would not let you go home with her?\"\nhe asked, with a faint smile that nearly exasperated me beyond control.\nBut, swallowing down all fiercer answers, I merely demanded,\u2014\"What\nbusiness is it of yours?\"\n\"Why, none,\" replied he with provoking quietness; \"only,\"\u2014and he raised\nhis eyes to my face, and spoke with unusual solemnity,\u2014\"only let me\ntell you, Markham, that if you have any designs in that quarter, they\nwill certainly fail; and it grieves me to see you cherishing false\nhopes, and wasting your strength in useless efforts, for\u2014\"\n\"Hypocrite!\" I exclaimed; and he held his breath, and looked very\nblank, turned white about the gills, and went away without another\nword.\nI had wounded him to the quick; and I was glad of it.",

At length I concluded that the separation could be\nendured no longer (by this time, you will see, I was pretty far gone);\nand, taking from the book-case an old volume that I thought she might\nbe interested in, though, from its unsightly and somewhat dilapidated\ncondition, I had not yet ventured to offer it for perusal, I hastened\naway,\u2014but not without sundry misgivings as to how she would receive me,\nor how I could summon courage to present myself with so slight an\nexcuse. But, perhaps, I might see her in the field or the garden, and\nthen there would be no great difficulty: it was the formal knocking at\nthe door, with the prospect of being gravely ushered in by Rachel, to\nthe presence of a surprised, uncordial mistress, that so greatly\ndisturbed me.\nMy wish, however, was not gratified. Mrs. Graham herself was not to be\nseen; but there was Arthur playing with his frolicsome little dog in\nthe garden. I looked over the gate and called him to me. He wanted me\nto come in; but I told him I could not without his mother's leave.\n\"I'll go and ask her,\" said the child.\n\"No, no, Arthur, you mustn't do that; but if she's not engaged, just\nask her to come here a minute. Tell her I want to speak to her.\"\nHe ran to perform my bidding, and quickly returned with his mother. How\nlovely she looked with her dark ringlets streaming in the light summer\nbreeze, her fair cheek slightly flushed, and her countenance radiant\nwith smiles. Dear Arthur! what did I not owe to you for this and every\nother happy meeting? Through him I was at once delivered from all\nformality, and terror, and constraint. In love affairs, there is no\nmediator like a merry, simple-hearted child\u2014ever ready to cement\ndivided hearts, to span the unfriendly gulf of custom, to melt the ice\nof cold reserve, and overthrow the separating walls of dread formality\nand pride.",

Tell me where you are\ngoing, and what you mean to do\u2014at once, and distinctly!\"\n\"Will you take your hand off the bridle?\" said he, quietly\u2014\"you're\nhurting my pony's mouth.\"\n\"You and your pony be\u2014\"\n\"What makes you so coarse and brutal, Markham? I'm quite ashamed of\nyou.\"\n\"You answer my questions\u2014before you leave this spot! I _will_ know what\nyou mean by this perfidious duplicity!\"\n\"I shall answer no questions till you let go the bridle,\u2014if you stand\ntill morning.\"\n\"Now then,\" said I, unclosing my hand, but still standing before him.\n\"Ask me some other time, when you can speak like a gentleman,\" returned\nhe, and he made an effort to pass me again; but I quickly re-captured\nthe pony, scarce less astonished than its master at such uncivil usage.\n\"Really, Mr. Markham, this is _too_ much!\" said the latter. \"Can I not\ngo to see my tenant on matters of business, without being assaulted in\nthis manner by\u2014?\"\n\"This is no time for business, sir!\u2014I'll tell you, now, what I think of\nyour conduct.\"\n\"You'd better defer your opinion to a more convenient season,\"\ninterrupted he in a low tone\u2014\"here's the vicar.\" And, in truth, the\nvicar was just behind me, plodding homeward from some remote corner of\nhis parish. I immediately released the squire; and he went on his way,\nsaluting Mr. Millward as he passed.\n\"What! quarrelling, Markham?\" cried the latter, addressing himself to\nme,\u2014\"and about that young widow, I doubt?\" he added, reproachfully\nshaking his head. \"But let me tell you, young man\" (here he put his\nface into mine with an important, confidential air), \"she's not worth\nit!\" and he confirmed the assertion by a solemn nod.\n\"MR. MILLWARD,\" I exclaimed, in a tone of wrathful menace that made the\nreverend gentleman look round\u2014aghast\u2014astounded at such unwonted\ninsolence, and stare me in the face, with a look that plainly said,\n\"What, this to me!\" But I was too indignant to apologise, or to speak\nanother word to him: I turned away, and hastened homewards, descending\nwith rapid strides the steep, rough lane, and leaving him to follow as\nhe pleased.",

I don't go once in six weeks\u2014what do you mean?\"\n\"Well, but if I were you, I wouldn't have so much to do with Mrs.\nGraham.\"\n\"Why, Rose, are you, too, giving in to the prevailing opinion?\"\n\"No,\" returned she, hesitatingly\u2014\"but I've heard so much about her\nlately, both at the Wilsons' and the vicarage;\u2014and besides, mamma says,\nif she were a proper person she would not be living there by\nherself\u2014and don't you remember last winter, Gilbert, all that about the\nfalse name to the picture; and how she explained it\u2014saying she had\nfriends or acquaintances from whom she wished her present residence to\nbe concealed, and that she was afraid of their tracing her out;\u2014and\nthen, how suddenly she started up and left the room when that person\ncame\u2014whom she took good care not to let us catch a glimpse of, and who\nArthur, with such an air of mystery, told us was his mamma's friend?\"\n\"Yes, Rose, I remember it all; and I can forgive your uncharitable\nconclusions; for, perhaps, if I did not know her myself, I should put\nall these things together, and believe the same as you do; but thank\nGod, I do know her; and I should be unworthy the name of a man, if I\ncould believe anything that was said against her, unless I heard it\nfrom her own lips.\u2014I should as soon believe such things of you, Rose.\"\n\"Oh, Gilbert!\"\n\"Well, do you think I _could_ believe anything of the kind,\u2014whatever\nthe Wilsons and Millwards dared to whisper?\"\n\"I should hope _not_ indeed!\"\n\"And why not?\u2014Because I know you\u2014Well, and I know her just as well.\"\n\"Oh, no! you know nothing of her former life; and last year, at this\ntime, you did not know that such a person existed.\"\n\"No matter. There is such a thing as looking through a person's eyes\ninto the heart, and learning more of the height, and breadth, and depth\nof another's soul in one hour than it might take you a lifetime to\ndiscover, if he or she were not disposed to reveal it, or if you had\nnot the sense to understand it.\"\n\"Then you _are_ going to see her this evening?\"\n\"To be sure I am!\"\n\"But what would mamma say, Gilbert!\"\n\"Mamma needn't know.\"\n\"But she must know some time, if you go on.\"\n\"Go on!\u2014there's no going on in the matter.

My mother sat opposite, an awe-struck but admiring\nauditor.\n\"'Mrs. Graham,' said I,\" he continued, shaking his head as he spoke,\n\"'these are terrible reports!' 'What, sir?' says she, affecting to be\nignorant of my meaning.

She turned white in the face, and\ndrew her breath through her teeth in a savage sort of way;\u2014but she\noffered no extenuation or defence; and with a kind of shameless\ncalmness\u2014shocking indeed to witness in one so young\u2014as good as told me\nthat my remonstrance was unavailing, and my pastoral advice quite\nthrown away upon her\u2014nay, that my very _presence was_ displeasing while\nI spoke such things.

Why have you no fire?\" I said, looking\nround on the gloomy apartment.\n\"It is summer yet,\" she replied.\n\"But _we always_ have a fire in the evenings, if we can bear it; and\nyou especially require one in this cold house and dreary room.\"\n\"You should have come a little sooner, and I would have had one lighted\nfor you: but it is not worth while now\u2014you won't stay many minutes, you\nsay, and Arthur is gone to bed.\"\n\"But I have a fancy for a fire, nevertheless. Will you order one, if I\nring?\"\n\"Why, Gilbert, you don't _look_ cold!\" said she, smilingly regarding my\nface, which no doubt seemed warm enough.\n\"No,\" replied I, \"but I want to see you comfortable before I go.\"\n\"Me comfortable!\" repeated she, with a bitter laugh, as if there were\nsomething amusingly absurd in the idea. \"It suits me better as it is,\"\nshe added, in a tone of mournful resignation.\nBut determined to have my own way, I pulled the bell.\n\"There now, Helen!\" I said, as the approaching steps of Rachel were\nheard in answer to the summons. There was nothing for it but to turn\nround and desire the maid to light the fire.\nI owe Rachel a grudge to this day for the look she cast upon me ere she\ndeparted on her mission, the sour, suspicious, inquisitorial look that\nplainly demanded, \"What are _you_ here for, I wonder?\" Her mistress did\nnot fail to notice it, and a shade of uneasiness darkened her brow.\n\"You must not stay long, Gilbert,\" said she, when the door was closed\nupon us.\n\"I'm not going to,\" said I, somewhat testily, though without a grain of\nanger in my heart against any one but the meddling old woman. \"But,\nHelen, I've something to say to you before I go.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"No, not now\u2014I don't know yet precisely what it is, or how to say it,\"\nreplied I, with more truth than wisdom; and then, fearing lest she\nshould turn me out of the house, I began talking about indifferent\nmatters in order to gain time. Meanwhile Rachel came in to kindle the\nfire, which was soon effected by thrusting a red-hot poker between the\nbars of the grate, where the fuel was already disposed for ignition.\nShe honoured me with another of her hard, inhospitable looks in\ndeparting, but, little moved thereby, I went on talking; and setting a\nchair for Mrs. Graham on one side of the hearth, and one for myself on\nthe other, I ventured to sit down, though half suspecting she would\nrather see me go.",

            "text": "\"I can safely answer no to that: you cannot have such grave confessions\nto make\u2014you must be trying my faith, Helen.\"\n\"No, no, no,\" she earnestly repeated\u2014\"I wish it were so! Thank heaven!\"\nshe added, \"I have no great crime to confess; but I have more than you\nwill like to hear, or, perhaps, can readily excuse,\u2014and more than I can\ntell you now; so let me entreat you to leave me!\"\n\"I will; but answer me this one question first;\u2014do you love me?\"\n\"I will not answer it!\"\n\"Then I will conclude you do; and so good-night.\"\nShe turned from me to hide the emotion she could not quite control; but\nI took her hand and fervently kissed it.\n\"Gilbert, _do_ leave me!\" she cried, in a tone of such thrilling\nanguish that I felt it would be cruel to disobey.\nBut I gave one look back before I closed the door, and saw her leaning\nforward on the table, with her hands pressed against her eyes, sobbing\nconvulsively; yet I withdrew in silence. I felt that to obtrude my\nconsolations on her then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings.\nTo tell you all the questionings and conjectures\u2014the fears, and hopes,\nand wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as\nI descended the hill, would almost fill a volume in itself. But before\nI was half-way down, a sentiment of strong sympathy for her I had left\nbehind me had displaced all other feelings, and seemed imperatively to\ndraw me back: I began to think, \"Why am I hurrying so fast in this\ndirection? Can I find comfort or consolation\u2014peace, certainty,\ncontentment, all\u2014or anything that I want at home? and can I leave all\nperturbation, sorrow, and anxiety behind me there?\"\nAnd I turned round to look at the old Hall. There was little besides\nthe chimneys visible above my contracted horizon. I walked back to get\na better view of it. When it rose in sight, I stood still a moment to\nlook, and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of\nattraction. Something called me nearer\u2014nearer still\u2014and why not, pray?\nMight I not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable\npile with the full moon in the cloudless heaven shining so calmly above\nit\u2014with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to an August night\u2014and the\nmistress of my soul within, than in returning to my home, where all\ncomparatively was light, and life, and cheerfulness, and therefore\ninimical to me in my present frame of mind,\u2014and the more so that its\ninmates all were more or less imbued with that detestable belief, the\nvery _thought_ of which made my blood boil in my veins\u2014and how could I\nendure to hear it openly declared, or cautiously insinuated\u2014which was\nworse?\u2014I had had trouble enough already, with some babbling fiend that\nwould keep whispering in my ear, \"It may be true,\" till I had shouted\naloud, \"It is false! I defy you to make me suppose it!\"\nI could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window. I\nwent up to the garden wall, and stood leaning over it, with my eyes\nfixed upon the lattice, wondering what she was doing, thinking, or\nsuffering now, and wishing I could speak to her but one word, or even\ncatch one glimpse of her, before I went.\nI had not thus looked, and wished, and wondered long, before I vaulted\nover the barrier, unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance\nthrough the window, just to see if she were more composed than when we\nparted;\u2014and if I found her still in deep distress, perhaps I might\nventure attempt a word of comfort\u2014to utter one of the many things I\nshould have said before, instead of aggravating her sufferings by my\nstupid impetuosity. I looked. Her chair was vacant: so was the room.\nBut at that moment some one opened the outer door, and a voice\u2014_her_\nvoice\u2014said,\u2014\"Come out\u2014I want to see the moon, and breathe the evening\nair: they will do me good\u2014if anything will.\"\nHere, then, were she and Rachel coming to take a walk in the garden. I\nwished myself safe back over the wall. I stood, however, in the shadow\nof the tall holly-bush, which, standing between the window and the\nporch, at present screened me from observation, but did not prevent me\nfrom seeing two figures come forth into the moonlight: Mrs. Graham\nfollowed by another\u2014_not_ Rachel, but a young man, slender and rather\ntall. O heavens, how my temples throbbed! Intense anxiety darkened my\nsight; but I thought\u2014yes, and the voice confirmed it\u2014it was Mr.\nLawrence!\n\"You should not let it worry you so much, Helen,\" said he; \"I will be\nmore cautious in future; and in time\u2014\"\nI did not hear the rest of the sentence; for he walked close beside her\nand spoke so gently that I could not catch the words. My heart was\nsplitting with hatred; but I listened intently for her reply. I heard\nit plainly enough.\n\"But I must leave this place, Frederick,\" she said\u2014\"I never can be\nhappy here,\u2014nor anywhere else, indeed,\" she added, with a mirthless\nlaugh,\u2014\"but I cannot rest here.\"\n\"But where could you find a better place?\" replied he, \"so secluded\u2014so\nnear me, if you think anything of that.\"\n\"Yes,\" interrupted she, \"it is all I could wish, if they could only\nhave left me alone.\"\n\"But wherever you go, Helen, there will be the same sources of\nannoyance. I cannot consent to lose you: I must go with you, or come to\nyou; and there are meddling fools elsewhere, as well as here.\"\nWhile thus conversing they had sauntered slowly past me, down the walk,\nand I heard no more of their discourse; but I saw him put his arm round\nher waist, while she lovingly rested her hand on his shoulder;\u2014and\nthen, a tremulous darkness obscured my sight, my heart sickened and my\nhead burned like fire: I half rushed, half staggered from the spot,\nwhere horror had kept me rooted, and leaped or tumbled over the wall\u2014I\nhardly know which\u2014but I know that, afterwards, like a passionate child,\nI dashed myself on the ground and lay there in a paroxysm of anger and\ndespair\u2014how long, I cannot undertake to say; but it must have been a\nconsiderable time; for when, having partially relieved myself by a\ntorment of tears, and looked up at the moon, shining so calmly and\ncarelessly on, as little influenced by my misery as I was by its\npeaceful radiance, and earnestly prayed for death or forgetfulness, I\nhad risen and journeyed homewards\u2014little regarding the way, but carried\ninstinctively by my feet to the door, I found it bolted against me, and",

Do tell me what it is? Has anything happened?\"\n\"It's nothing,\" cried I, ready to stamp with vexation because the\ncandle would not light. Then, suppressing my irritation, I added, \"I've\nbeen walking too fast, that's all. Good-night,\" and marched off to bed,\nregardless of the \"Walking too fast! where have you been?\" that was\ncalled after me from below.\nMy mother followed me to the very door of my room with her questionings\nand advice concerning my health and my conduct; but I implored her to\nlet me alone till morning; and she withdrew, and at length I had the\nsatisfaction to hear her close her own door. There was no sleep for me,\nhowever, that night as I thought; and instead of attempting to solicit\nit, I employed myself in rapidly pacing the chamber, having first\nremoved my boots, lest my mother should hear me. But the boards\ncreaked, and she was watchful. I had not walked above a quarter of an\nhour before she was at the door again.\n\"Gilbert, why are you not in bed\u2014you said you wanted to go?\"\n\"Confound it! I'm going,\" said I.\n\"But why are you so long about it?

And yet it\nwas not wholly sleepless. Towards morning my distracting thoughts began\nto lose all pretensions to coherency, and shape themselves into\nconfused and feverish dreams, and, at length, there followed an\ninterval of unconscious slumber. But then the dawn of bitter\nrecollection that succeeded\u2014the waking to find life a blank, and worse\nthan a blank, teeming with torment and misery\u2014not a mere barren\nwilderness, but full of thorns and briers\u2014to find myself deceived,\nduped, hopeless, my affections trampled upon, my angel not an angel,\nand my friend a fiend incarnate\u2014it was worse than if I had not slept at\nall.\nIt was a dull, gloomy morning; the weather had changed like my\nprospects, and the rain was pattering against the window. I rose,\nnevertheless, and went out; not to look after the farm, though that\nwould serve as my excuse, but to cool my brain, and regain, if\npossible, a sufficient degree of composure to meet the family at the\nmorning meal without exciting inconvenient remarks.

However, I determined to be cool and civil. Eliza seemed to\nhave made the same resolution on her part. We had not met since the\nevening of the tea-party; but there was no visible emotion either of\npleasure or pain, no attempt at pathos, no display of injured pride:\nshe was cool in temper, civil in demeanour. There was even an ease and\ncheerfulness about her air and manner that I made no pretension to; but\nthere was a depth of malice in her too expressive eye that plainly told\nme I was not forgiven; for, though she no longer hoped to win me to\nherself, she still hated her rival, and evidently delighted to wreak\nher spite on me. On the other hand, Miss Wilson was as affable and\ncourteous as heart could wish, and though I was in no very conversable\nhumour myself, the two ladies between them managed to keep up a pretty\ncontinuous fire of small talk. But Eliza took advantage of the first\nconvenient pause to ask if I had lately seen Mrs. Graham, in a tone of\nmerely casual inquiry, but with a sidelong glance\u2014intended to be\nplayfully mischievous\u2014really, brimful and running over with malice.\n\"Not lately,\" I replied, in a careless tone, but sternly repelling her\nodious glances with my eyes; for I was vexed to feel the colour\nmounting to my forehead, despite my strenuous efforts to appear\nunmoved.\n\"What! are you beginning to tire already? I thought so noble a creature\nwould have power to attach you for a year at least!\"\n\"I would rather not speak of her now.\"\n\"Ah! then you are convinced, at last, of your mistake\u2014you have at\nlength discovered that your divinity is not quite the immaculate\u2014\"\n\"I desired you not to speak of her, Miss Eliza.\"\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon! I perceive Cupid's arrows have been too sharp\nfor you: the wounds, being more than skin-deep, are not yet healed, and\nbleed afresh at every mention of the loved one's name.\"\n\"Say, rather,\" interposed Miss Wilson, \"that Mr. Markham feels that\nname is unworthy to be mentioned in the presence of right-minded\nfemales. I wonder, Eliza, you should think of referring to that\nunfortunate person\u2014you might know the mention of her would be anything\nbut agreeable to any one here present.\"",

Formerly, the slightest hint,\nor mere fancied coldness in tone or glance, had sufficed to repulse\nhim: now, positive rudeness could not drive him away.

It was no generous impulse\u2014no kind relentings that\nled me to this\u2014nor even the fear of what might be the consequences to\nmyself, if I finished my assault upon the squire by leaving him thus\nneglected, and exposed to further injury; it was, simply, the voice of\nconscience; and I took great credit to myself for attending so promptly\nto its dictates\u2014and judging the merit of the deed by the sacrifice it\ncost, I was not far wrong.\nMr. Lawrence and his pony had both altered their positions in some\ndegree. The pony had wandered eight or ten yards further away; and he\nhad managed, somehow, to remove himself from the middle of the road: I\nfound him seated in a recumbent position on the bank,\u2014looking very\nwhite and sickly still, and holding his cambric handkerchief (now more\nred than white) to his head. It must have been a powerful blow; but\nhalf the credit\u2014or the blame of it (which you please) must be\nattributed to the whip, which was garnished with a massive horse's head\nof plated metal. The grass, being sodden with rain, afforded the young\ngentleman a rather inhospitable couch; his clothes were considerably\nbemired; and his hat was rolling in the mud on the other side of the\nroad. But his thoughts seemed chiefly bent upon his pony, on which he\nwas wistfully gazing\u2014half in helpless anxiety, and half in hopeless\nabandonment to his fate.\nI dismounted, however, and having fastened my own animal to the nearest\ntree, first picked up his hat, intending to clap it on his head; but\neither he considered his head unfit for a hat, or the hat, in its\npresent condition, unfit for his head; for shrinking away the one, he\ntook the other from my hand, and scornfully cast it aside.\n\"It's good enough for _you_,\" I muttered.\nMy next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him, which\nwas soon accomplished; for the beast was quiet enough in the main, and\nonly winced and flirted a trifle till I got hold of the bridle\u2014but\nthen, I must see him in the saddle.\n\"Here, you fellow\u2014scoundrel\u2014dog\u2014give me your hand, and I'll help you to\nmount.\"\nNo; he turned from me in disgust. I attempted to take him by the arm.\nHe shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch.\n\"What, you won't! Well! you may sit there till doomsday, for what I\ncare. But I suppose you don't want to lose all the blood in your\nbody\u2014I'll just condescend to bind that up for you.\"\n\"Let me alone, if you please.\"\n\"Humph; with all my heart. You may go to the d\u2014l, if you choose\u2014and say\nI sent you.\"\nBut before I abandoned him to his fate I flung his pony's bridle over a\nstake in the hedge, and threw him my handkerchief, as his own was now\nsaturated with blood. He took it and cast it back to me in abhorrence\nand contempt, with all the strength he could muster. It wanted but this\nto fill the measure of his offences. With execrations not loud but deep\nI left him to live or die as he could, well satisfied that I had done\n_my_ duty in attempting to save him\u2014but forgetting how I had erred in\nbringing him into such a condition, and how insultingly my\nafter-services had been offered\u2014and sullenly prepared to meet the\nconsequences if he should choose to say I had attempted to murder\nhim\u2014which I thought not unlikely, as it seemed probable he was actuated\nby such spiteful motives in so perseveringly refusing my assistance.\nHaving remounted my horse, I just looked back to see how he was getting\non, before I rode away. He had risen from the ground, and grasping his\npony's mane, was attempting to resume his seat in the saddle; but\nscarcely had he put his foot in the stirrup, when a sickness or\ndizziness seemed to overpower him: he leant forward a moment, with his\nhead drooped on the animal's back, and then made one more effort, which\nproving ineffectual, he sank back on the bank, where I left him,\nreposing his head on the oozy turf, and to all appearance, as calmly\nreclining as if he had been taking his rest on his sofa at home.",

No; he had only received a cut above the temple,\nand perhaps a few bruises from the fall, or the hoofs of his own pony:\nthat could not kill him if he lay there half the day; and, if he could\nnot help himself, surely some one would be coming by: it would be\nimpossible that a whole day should pass and no one traverse the road\nbut ourselves.

I was not _obliged_ to\nenter into explanations further than I thought proper. Perhaps he might\nchoose to be silent on the subject, for fear of raising inquiries as to\nthe cause of the quarrel, and drawing the public attention to his\nconnection with Mrs. Graham, which, whether for her sake or his own, he\nseemed so very desirous to conceal.\nThus reasoning, I trotted away to the town, where I duly transacted my\nbusiness, and performed various little commissions for my mother and\nRose, with very laudable exactitude, considering the different\ncircumstances of the case. In returning home, I was troubled with\nsundry misgivings about the unfortunate Lawrence. The question, What if\nI should find him lying still on the damp earth, fairly dying of cold\nand exhaustion\u2014or already stark and chill? thrust itself most\nunpleasantly upon my mind, and the appalling possibility pictured\nitself with painful vividness to my imagination as I approached the\nspot where I had left him.

Won't you, Gilbert\u2014as soon as you've\nhad something to eat?\"\n\"No, no\u2014how can we tell that it isn't all a false report? It's highly\nim-\"\n\"Oh, I'm sure it isn't; for the village is all alive about it; and I\nsaw two people that had seen others that had seen the man that found\nhim. That sounds far-fetched; but it isn't so when you think of it.\"\n\"Well, but Lawrence is a good rider; it is not likely he would fall\nfrom his horse at all; and if he did, it is highly improbable he would\nbreak his bones in that way. It must be a gross exaggeration at least.\"\n\"No; but the horse kicked him\u2014or something.\"\n\"What, his quiet little pony?\"\n\"How do you know it was that?\"\n\"He seldom rides any other.\"\n\"At any rate,\" said my mother, \"you will call to-morrow. Whether it be\ntrue or false, exaggerated or otherwise, we shall like to know how he\nis.\"\n\"Fergus may go.\"\n\"Why not you?\"\n\"He has more time. I am busy just now.\"\n\"Oh! but, Gilbert, how can you be so composed about it? You won't mind\nbusiness for an hour or two in a case of this sort, when your friend is\nat the point of death.\"\n\"He is _not_, I tell you.\"\n\"For anything you know, he _may_ be: you can't tell till you have seen\nhim. At all events, he must have met with some terrible accident, and\nyou ought to see him: he'll take it very unkind if you don't.\"\n\"Confound it! I can't. He and I have not been on good terms of late.\"\n\"Oh, my _dear_ boy! Surely, surely you are not so unforgiving as to\ncarry your little differences to such a length as\u2014\"\n\"Little differences, indeed!\" I muttered.\n\"Well, but only remember the occasion. Think how\u2014\"\n\"Well, well, don't bother me now\u2014I'll see about it,\" I replied.\nAnd my seeing about it was to send Fergus next morning, with my\nmother's compliments, to make the requisite inquiries; for, of course,\nmy going was out of the question\u2014or sending a message either. He\nbrought back intelligence that the young squire was laid up with the\ncomplicated evils of a broken head and certain contusions (occasioned\nby a fall\u2014of which he did not trouble himself to relate the\nparticulars\u2014and the subsequent misconduct of his horse), and a severe\ncold, the consequence of lying on the wet ground in the rain; but there\nwere no broken bones, and no immediate prospects of dissolution.\nIt was evident, then, that for Mrs. Graham's sake it was not his\nintention to criminate me.",

You remember that evening when I was here last?\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"Even then you dropped some hints that might have opened the eyes of a\nwiser man; but they had no such effect upon me: I went on trusting and\nbelieving, hoping against hope, and adoring where I could not\ncomprehend. It so happened, however, that after I left you I turned\nback\u2014drawn by pure depth of sympathy and ardour of affection\u2014not daring\nto intrude my presence openly upon you, but unable to resist the\ntemptation of catching one glimpse through the window, just to see how\nyou were: for I had left you apparently in great affliction, and I\npartly blamed my own want of forbearance and discretion as the cause of\nit. If I did wrong, love alone was my incentive, and the punishment was\nsevere enough; for it was just as I had reached that tree, that you\ncame out into the garden with your friend. Not choosing to show myself,\nunder the circumstances, I stood still, in the shadow, till you had\nboth passed by.\"\n\"And how much of our conversation did you hear?\"\n\"I heard quite enough, Helen. And it was well for me that I did hear\nit; for nothing less could have cured my infatuation. I always said and\nthought, that I would never believe a word against you, unless I heard\nit from your own lips. All the hints and affirmations of others I\ntreated as malignant, baseless slanders; your own self-accusations I\nbelieved to be overstrained; and all that seemed unaccountable in your\nposition I trusted that you could account for if you chose.\"\nMrs. Graham had discontinued her walk. She leant against one end of the\nchimney-piece, opposite that near which I was standing, with her chin\nresting on her closed hand, her eyes\u2014no longer burning with anger, but\ngleaming with restless excitement\u2014sometimes glancing at me while I\nspoke, then coursing the opposite wall, or fixed upon the carpet.\n\"You should have come to me after all,\" said she, \"and heard what I had\nto say in my own justification. It was ungenerous and wrong to withdraw\nyourself so secretly and suddenly, immediately after such ardent\nprotestations of attachment, without ever assigning a reason for the\nchange. You should have told me all\u2014no matter _how_ bitterly. It would\nhave been better than this silence.\"\n\"To what end should I have done so? You could not have enlightened me\nfurther, on the subject which alone concerned me; nor could you have\nmade me discredit the evidence of my senses. I desired our intimacy to\nbe discontinued at once, as you yourself had acknowledged would\nprobably be the case if I knew all; but I did not wish to upbraid\nyou,\u2014though (as you also acknowledged) you had deeply wronged me. Yes,\nyou have done me an injury you can never repair\u2014or any other either\u2014you\nhave blighted the freshness and promise of youth, and made my life a\nwilderness! I might live a hundred years, but I could never recover\nfrom the effects of this withering blow\u2014and never forget it!\nHereafter\u2014You smile, Mrs. Graham,\" said I, suddenly stopping short,\nchecked in my passionate declamation by unutterable feelings to behold\nher actually _smiling_ at the picture of the ruin she had wrought.\n\"Did I?\" replied she, looking seriously up; \"I was not aware of it. If\nI did, it was not for pleasure at the thoughts of the harm I had done\nyou. Heaven knows I have had torment enough at the bare possibility of\nthat; it was for joy to find that you had some depth of soul and\nfeeling after all, and to hope that I had not been utterly mistaken in\nyour worth. But smiles and tears are so alike with me, they are neither\nof them confined to any particular feelings: I often cry when I am\nhappy, and smile when I am sad.\"",

It may be very true\u2014and I hope is true,\nthat there are very few men whom you would choose to marry, of\nyourself. It is not, indeed, to be supposed that you would _wish_ to\nmarry _any_ one till you were asked: a girl's affections should never\nbe won unsought. But when they _are_ sought\u2014when the citadel of the\nheart is fairly besieged\u2014it is apt to surrender sooner than the owner\nis aware of, and often against her better judgment, and in opposition\nto all her preconceived ideas of what she could have loved, unless she\nbe extremely careful and discreet. Now, I want to warn you, Helen, of\nthese things, and to exhort you to be watchful and circumspect from the\nvery commencement of your career, and not to suffer your heart to be\nstolen from you by the first foolish or unprincipled person that covets\nthe possession of it.\u2014You know, my dear, you are only just eighteen;\nthere is plenty of time before you, and neither your uncle nor I are in\nany hurry to get you off our hands, and I may venture to say, there\nwill be no lack of suitors; for you can boast a good family, a pretty\nconsiderable fortune and expectations, and, I may as well tell you\nlikewise\u2014for, if I don't, others will\u2014that you have a fair share of\nbeauty besides\u2014and I hope you may never have cause to regret it!\"\n\"I hope not, aunt; but why should you fear it?\"\n\"Because, my dear, beauty is that quality which, next to money, is\ngenerally the most attractive to the worst kinds of men; and,\ntherefore, it is likely to entail a great deal of trouble on the\npossessor.\"\n\"Have _you_ been troubled in that way, aunt?\"\n\"No, Helen,\" said she, with reproachful gravity, \"but I know many that\nhave; and some, through carelessness, have been the wretched victims of\ndeceit; and some, through weakness, have fallen into snares and\ntemptations terrible to relate.\"",

A gentleman stood by, who had been watching our\nconference for some time, evidently much amused at my companion's\nremorseless pertinacity and my manifest annoyance, and laughing to\nhimself at the asperity and uncompromising spirit of my replies. At\nlength, however, he withdrew, and went to the lady of the house,\napparently for the purpose of asking an introduction to me, for,\nshortly after, they both came up, and she introduced him as Mr.\nHuntingdon, the son of a late friend of my uncle's.

For instance, I\nshould know by your countenance that you were not of a cheerful,\nsanguine disposition; and I should know by Mr. Wilmot's, that he was a\nworthless old reprobate; and by Mr. Boarham's, that he was not an\nagreeable companion; and by Mr. Huntingdon's, that he was neither a\nfool nor a knave, though, possibly, neither a sage nor a saint\u2014but that\nis no matter to me, as I am not likely to meet him again\u2014unless as an\noccasional partner in the ball-room.\"",

I waited nearly half-an-hour in uncomfortable\nsuspense, expecting every minute to be called, and vainly longing to\nhear him go. Then footsteps were heard on the stairs, and my aunt\nentered the room with a solemn countenance, and closed the door behind\nher.\n\"Here is Mr. Boarham, Helen,\" said she. \"He wishes to see you.\"\n\"Oh, aunt!\u2014Can't you tell him I'm indisposed?\u2014I'm sure I am\u2014to see\n_him_.\"\n\"Nonsense, my dear! this is no trifling matter. He is come on a very\nimportant errand\u2014to ask your hand in marriage of your uncle and me.\"\n\"I hope my uncle and you told him it was not in your power to give it.\nWhat right had he to ask _any_ one before me?\"\n\"Helen!\"\n\"What did my uncle say?\"\n\"He said he would not interfere in the matter; if you liked to accept\nMr. Boarham's obliging offer, you\u2014\"\n\"Did he say obliging offer?\"\n\"No; he said if you liked to take him you might; and if not, you might\nplease yourself.\"\n\"He said right; and what did you say?\"\n\"It is no matter what I said. What will _you_ say?\u2014that is the\nquestion. He is now waiting to ask you himself; but consider well\nbefore you go; and if you intend to refuse him, give me your reasons.\"\n\"I _shall_ refuse him, of course; but you must tell me how, for I want\nto be civil and yet decided\u2014and when I've got rid of him, I'll give you\nmy reasons afterwards.\"\n\"But stay, Helen; sit down a little and compose yourself. Mr. Boarham\nis in no particular hurry, for he has little doubt of your acceptance;\nand I want to speak with you. Tell me, my dear, what are your\nobjections to him? Do you deny that he is an upright, honourable man?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Do you deny that he is sensible, sober, respectable?\"\n\"No; he may be all this, but\u2014\"\n\"_But_ Helen! How many such men do you expect to meet with in the\nworld? Upright, honourable, sensible, sober, respectable! Is _this_\nsuch an every-day character that you should reject the possessor of\nsuch noble qualities without a moment's hesitation? Yes, _noble_ I may\ncall them; for think of the full meaning of each, and how many\ninestimable virtues they include (and I might add many more to the\nlist), and consider that all this is laid at your feet. It is in your\npower to secure this inestimable blessing for life\u2014a worthy and\nexcellent husband, who loves you tenderly, but not too fondly so as to\nblind him to your faults, and will be your guide throughout life's\npilgrimage, and your partner in eternal bliss. Think how\u2014\"\n\"But I hate him, aunt,\" said I, interrupting this unusual flow of\neloquence.\n\"Hate him, Helen! Is this a Christian spirit?\u2014_you hate him?_ and he so\ngood a man!\"\n\"I don't hate him as a man, but as a husband. As a man, I love him so\nmuch that I wish him a better wife than I\u2014one as good as himself, or\nbetter\u2014if you think that possible\u2014provided she could like him; but I\nnever could, and therefore\u2014\"\n\"But why not? What objection do you find?\"\n\"Firstly, he is at least forty years old\u2014considerably more, I should\nthink\u2014and I am but eighteen; secondly, he is narrow-minded and bigoted\nin the extreme; thirdly, his tastes and feelings are wholly dissimilar\nto mine; fourthly, his looks, voice, and manner are particularly\ndispleasing to me; and, finally, I have an aversion to his whole person\nthat I never can surmount.\"\n\"Then you ought to surmount it. And please to compare him for a moment\nwith Mr. Huntingdon, and, good looks apart (which contribute nothing to\nthe merit of the man, or to the happiness of married life, and which\nyou have so often professed to hold in light esteem), tell me which is\nthe better man.\"\n\"I have no doubt Mr. Huntingdon is a much better man than you think\nhim; but we are not talking about him now, but about Mr. Boarham; and\nas I would rather grow, live, and die in single blessedness\u2014than be his\nwife, it is but right that I should tell him so at once, and put him\nout of suspense\u2014so let me go.\"\n\"But don't give him a flat denial; he has no idea of such a thing, and\nit would offend him greatly: say you have no thoughts of matrimony at\npresent\u2014\"\n\"But I _have_ thoughts of it.\"\n\"Or that you desire a further acquaintance.\"\n\"But I don't desire a further acquaintance\u2014quite the contrary.\"\nAnd without waiting for further admonitions I left the room and went to\nseek Mr. Boarham. He was walking up and down the drawing-room, humming\nsnatches of tunes and nibbling the end of his cane.\n\"My dear young lady,\" said he, bowing and smirking with great\ncomplacency, \"I have your kind guardian's permission\u2014\"\n\"I know, sir,\" said I, wishing to shorten the scene as much as\npossible, \"and I am greatly obliged for your preference, but must beg\nto decline the honour you wish to confer, for I think we were not made\nfor each other, as you yourself would shortly discover if the\nexperiment were tried.\"\nMy aunt was right. It was quite evident he had had little doubt of my\nacceptance, and no idea of a positive denial. He was amazed, astounded\nat such an answer, but too incredulous to be much offended; and after a\nlittle humming and hawing, he returned to the attack.\n\"I know, my dear, that there exists a considerable disparity between us\nin years, in temperament, and perhaps some other things; but let me\nassure you, I shall not be severe to mark the faults and foibles of a\nyoung and ardent nature such as yours, and while I acknowledge them to\nmyself, and even rebuke them with all a father's care, believe me, no\nyouthful lover could be more tenderly indulgent towards the object of\nhis affections than I to you; and, on the other hand, let me hope that\nmy more experienced years and graver habits of reflection will be no\ndisparagement in your eyes, as I shall endeavour to make them all\nconducive to your happiness. Come, now! What do you say? Let us have no\nyoung lady's affectations and caprices, but speak out at once.\"\n\"I will, but only to repeat what I said before, that I am certain we\nwere not made for each other.\"\n\"You really think so?\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"But you don't know me\u2014you wish for a further acquaintance\u2014a longer\ntime to\u2014\"\n\"No, I don't. I know you as well as I ever shall, and better than you\nknow me, or you would never dream of uniting yourself to one so\nincongruous\u2014so utterly unsuitable to you in every way.\"\n\"But, my dear young lady, I don't look for perfection; I can excuse\u2014\"\n\"Thank you, Mr. Boarham, but I won't trespass upon your goodness. You\nmay save your indulgence and consideration for some more worthy object,\nthat won't tax them so heavily.\"\n\"But let me beg you to consult your aunt; that excellent lady, I am\nsure, will\u2014\"\n\"I have consulted her; and I know her wishes coincide with yours; but\nin such important matters, I take the liberty of judging for myself;\nand no persuasion can alter my inclinations, or induce me to believe\nthat such a step would be conducive to my happiness or yours\u2014and I\nwonder that a man of your experience and discretion should think of\nchoosing such a wife.\"\n\"Ah, well!\" said he, \"I have sometimes wondered at that myself. I have\nsometimes said to myself, 'Now Boarham, what is this you're after? Take\ncare, man\u2014look before you leap! This is a sweet, bewitching creature,\nbut remember, the brightest attractions to the lover too often prove\nthe husband's greatest torments!' I assure you my choice has not been\nmade without much reasoning and reflection. The seeming imprudence of\nthe match has cost me many an anxious thought by day, and many a\nsleepless hour by night; but at length I satisfied myself that it was\nnot, in very deed, imprudent. I saw my sweet girl was not without her\nfaults, but of these her youth, I trusted, was not one, but rather an\nearnest of virtues yet unblown\u2014a strong ground of presumption that her\nlittle defects of temper and errors of judgment, opinion, or manner\nwere not irremediable, but might easily be removed or mitigated by the\npatient efforts of a watchful and judicious adviser, and where I failed\nto enlighten and control, I thought I might safely undertake to pardon,\nfor the sake of her many excellences. Therefore, my dearest girl, since\n_I_ am satisfied, why should _you_ object\u2014on my account, at least?\"\n\"But to tell you the truth, Mr. Boarham, it is on my own account I\nprincipally object; so let us\u2014drop the subject,\" I would have said,\n\"for it is worse than useless to pursue it any further,\" but he\npertinaciously interrupted me with,\u2014\"But why so? I would love you,\ncherish you, protect you,\" &c., &c.\nI shall not trouble myself to put down all that passed between us.\nSuffice it to say, that I found him very troublesome, and very hard to\nconvince that I really meant what I said, and really _was_ so obstinate\nand blind to my own interests, that there was no shadow of a chance\nthat either he or my aunt would ever be able to overcome my objections.\nIndeed, I am not sure that I succeeded after all; though wearied with\nhis so pertinaciously returning to the same point and repeating the\nsame arguments over and over again, forcing me to reiterate the same\nreplies, I at length turned short and sharp upon him, and my last words\nwere,\u2014\"I tell you plainly, that it cannot be. No consideration can\ninduce me to marry against my inclinations. I respect you\u2014at least, I\nwould respect you, if you would behave like a sensible man\u2014but I cannot\nlove you, and never could\u2014and the more you talk the further you repel\nme; so pray don't say any more about it.\"\nWhereupon he wished me a good-morning, and withdrew, disconcerted and",

After a moment of silent contemplation, I\nwas beginning to comment on its beauties and peculiarities, when,\nplayfully pressing the hand he still retained within his arm, he\ninterrupted me with,\u2014\"Never mind the picture: it was not for that I\nbrought you here; it was to get you away from that scoundrelly old\nprofligate yonder, who is looking as if he would like to challenge me\nfor the affront.\"\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said I. \"This is twice you have\ndelivered me from such unpleasant companionship.\"\n\"Don't be too thankful,\" he answered: \"it is not all kindness to you;\nit is partly from a feeling of spite to your tormentors that makes me\ndelighted to do the old fellows a bad turn, though I don't think I have\nany great reason to dread them as rivals. Have I, Helen?\"\n\"You know I detest them both.\"\n\"And me?\"\n\"I have no reason to detest _you_.\"\n\"But what are your sentiments towards me? Helen\u2014Speak! How do you\nregard me?\"\nAnd again he pressed my hand; but I feared there was more of conscious\npower than tenderness in his demeanour, and I felt he had no right to\nextort a confession of attachment from me when he had made no\ncorrespondent avowal himself, and knew not what to answer. At last I\nsaid,\u2014\n\"How do _you_ regard _me?_\"\n\"Sweet angel, I adore you! I\u2014\"\n\"Helen, I want you a moment,\" said the distinct, low voice of my aunt,\nclose beside us. And I left him, muttering maledictions against his\nevil angel.\n\"Well, aunt, what is it? What do you want?\" said I, following her to\nthe embrasure of the window.\n\"I want you to join the company, when you are fit to be seen,\" returned\nshe, severely regarding me; \"but please to stay here a little, till\nthat shocking colour is somewhat abated, and your eyes have recovered\nsomething of their natural expression. I should be ashamed for anyone\nto see you in your present state.\"\nOf course, such a remark had no effect in reducing the \"shocking\ncolour\"; on the contrary, I felt my face glow with redoubled fires\nkindled by a complication of emotions, of which indignant, swelling\nanger was the chief. I offered no reply, however, but pushed aside the\ncurtain and looked into the night\u2014or rather into the lamp-lit square.\n\"Was Mr. Huntingdon proposing to you, Helen?\" inquired my too watchful\nrelative.\n\"No.\"\n\"What was he saying then? I heard something very like it.\"\n\"I don't know what he would have said, if you hadn't interrupted him.\"\n\"And would you have accepted him, Helen, if he had proposed?\"\n\"Of course not\u2014without consulting uncle and you.\"\n\"Oh! I'm glad, my dear, you have so much prudence left. Well, now,\" she\nadded, after a moment's pause, \"you have made yourself conspicuous\nenough for one evening. The ladies are directing inquiring glances\ntowards us at this moment, I see: I shall join them. Do you come too,\nwhen you are sufficiently composed to appear as usual.\"\n\"I am so now.\"\n\"Speak gently then, and don't look so malicious,\" said my calm, but\nprovoking aunt. \"We shall return home shortly, and then,\" she added\nwith solemn significance, \"I have much to say to you.\"",

She declined it, and thus opened the conference: \"Do\nyou remember, Helen, our conversation the night but one before we left\nStaningley?\"\n\"Yes, aunt.\"\n\"And do you remember how I warned you against letting your heart be\nstolen from you by those unworthy of its possession, and fixing your\naffections where approbation did not go before, and where reason and\njudgment withheld their sanction?\"\n\"Yes; but _my_ reason\u2014\"\n\"Pardon me\u2014and do you remember assuring me that there was no occasion\nfor uneasiness on your account; for you should never be _tempted_ to\nmarry a man who was deficient in sense or principle, however handsome\nor charming in other respects he might be, for you could not love him;\nyou should hate\u2014despise\u2014pity\u2014anything but love him\u2014were not those your\nwords?\"\n\"Yes; but\u2014\"\n\"And did you not say that your affection _must_ be founded on\napprobation; and that, unless you could approve and honour and respect,\nyou could not love?\"\n\"Yes; but I do approve, and honour, and respect\u2014\"\n\"How so, my dear? Is Mr. Huntingdon a good man?\"\n\"He is a much better man than you think him.\"\n\"That is nothing to the purpose. Is he a _good_ man?\"\n\"Yes\u2014in some respects. He has a good disposition.\"\n\"Is he a man of _principle?_\"\n\"Perhaps not, exactly; but it is only for want of thought. If he had\nsome one to advise him, and remind him of what is right\u2014\"\n\"He would soon learn, you think\u2014and you yourself would willingly\nundertake to be his teacher? But, my dear, he is, I believe, full ten\nyears older than you\u2014how is it that you are so beforehand in moral\nacquirements?\"\n\"Thanks to you, aunt, I have been well brought up, and had good\nexamples always before me, which he, most likely, has not; and,\nbesides, he is of a sanguine temperament, and a gay, thoughtless\ntemper, and I am naturally inclined to reflection.\"\n\"Well, now you have made him out to be deficient in both sense and\nprinciple, by your own confession\u2014\"\n\"Then, my sense and my principle are at his service.\"\n\"That sounds presumptuous, Helen. Do you think you have enough for\nboth; and do you imagine your merry, thoughtless profligate would allow\nhimself to be guided by a young girl like you?\"\n\"No; I should not wish to guide him; but I think I might have influence\nsufficient to save him from some errors, and I should think my life\nwell spent in the effort to preserve so noble a nature from\ndestruction. He always listens attentively now when I speak seriously\nto him (and I often venture to reprove his random way of talking), and\nsometimes he says that if he had me always by his side he should never\ndo or say a wicked thing, and that a little daily talk with me would\nmake him quite a saint. It may he partly jest and partly flattery, but\nstill\u2014\"\n\"But still you think it may be truth?\"\n\"If I do think there is any mixture of truth in it, it is not from\nconfidence in my own powers, but in _his_ natural goodness. And you\nhave no right to call him a profligate, aunt; he is nothing of the\nkind.\"\n\"Who told you so, my dear? What was that story about his intrigue with\na married lady\u2014Lady who was it?\u2014Miss Wilmot herself was telling you the\nother day?\"\n\"It was false\u2014false!\" I cried. \"I don't believe a word of it.\"\n\"You think, then, that he is a virtuous, well-conducted young man?\"\n\"I know nothing positive respecting his character. I only know that I\nhave heard nothing definite against it\u2014nothing that could be proved, at\nleast; and till people can prove their slanderous accusations, I will\nnot believe them. And I know this, that if he has committed errors,\nthey are only such as are common to youth, and such as nobody thinks\nanything about; for I see that everybody likes him, and all the mammas\nsmile upon him, and their daughters\u2014and Miss Wilmot herself\u2014are only\ntoo glad to attract his attention.\"\n\"Helen, the world _may_ look upon such offences as venial; a few\nunprincipled mothers may be anxious to catch a young man of fortune\nwithout reference _may_ his character; and thoughtless girls _may_ be\nglad to win the smiles of so handsome a gentleman, without seeking to\npenetrate beyond the surface; but _you_, I trusted, were better\ninformed than to see with their eyes, and judge with their perverted\njudgment. I did not think _you_ would call these venial errors!\"\n\"Nor do I, aunt; but if I hate the sins, I love the sinner, and would\ndo much for his salvation, even supposing your suspicions to be mainly\ntrue, which I do not and will not believe.\"\n\"Well, my dear, ask your uncle what sort of company he keeps, and if he\nis not banded with a set of loose, profligate young men, whom he calls\nhis friends, his jolly companions, and whose chief delight is to wallow\nin vice, and vie with each other who can run fastest and furthest down\nthe headlong road to the place prepared for the devil and his angels.\"\n\"Then I will save him from them.\"\n\"Oh, Helen, Helen! you little know the misery of uniting your fortunes\nto such a man!\"\n\"I have such confidence in him, aunt, notwithstanding all you say, that\nI would willingly risk my happiness for the chance of securing his. I\nwill leave better men to those who only consider their own advantage.\nIf he has done amiss, I shall consider my life well spent in saving him\nfrom the consequences of his early errors, and striving to recall him\nto the path of virtue. God grant me success!\"\nHere the conversation ended, for at this juncture my uncle's voice was\nheard from his chamber, loudly calling upon my aunt to come to bed. He\nwas in a bad humour that night; for his gout was worse. It had been\ngradually increasing upon him ever since we came to town; and my aunt\ntook advantage of the circumstance next morning to persuade him to\nreturn to the country immediately, without waiting for the close of the\nseason. His physician supported and enforced her arguments; and\ncontrary to her usual habits, she so hurried the preparations for\nremoval (as much for my sake as my uncle's, I think), that in a very\nfew days we departed; and I saw no more of Mr. Huntingdon. My aunt\nflatters herself I shall soon forget him\u2014perhaps she thinks I have\nforgotten him already, for I never mention his name; and she may\ncontinue to think so, till we meet again\u2014if ever that should be.

In all my employments, whatever I do, or see, or hear, has an\nultimate reference to him; whatever skill or knowledge I acquire is\nsome day to be turned to his advantage or amusement; whatever new\nbeauties in nature or art I discover are to be depicted to meet his\neye, or stored in my memory to be told him at some future period.

A small party he had invited to\nshoot. His friend Mr. Wilmot was one, and my aunt's friend, Mr.\nBoarham, another. This struck me as terrible news at the moment; but\nall regret and apprehension vanished like a dream when I heard that Mr.\nHuntingdon was actually to be a third! My aunt is greatly against his\ncoming, of course: she earnestly endeavoured to dissuade my uncle from\nasking him; but he, laughing at her objections, told her it was no use\ntalking, for the mischief was already done: he had invited Huntingdon\nand his friend Lord Lowborough before we left London, and nothing now\nremained but to fix the day for their coming. So he is safe, and I am\nsure of seeing him. I cannot express my joy. I find it very difficult\nto conceal it from my aunt; but I don't wish to trouble her with my\nfeelings till I know whether I ought to indulge them or not. If I find\nit my absolute duty to suppress them, they shall trouble no one but\nmyself; and if I can really feel myself justified in indulging this\nattachment, I can dare anything, even the anger and grief of my best\nfriend, for its object\u2014surely, I shall soon know. But they are not\ncoming till about the middle of the month.\nWe are to have two lady visitors also: Mr. Wilmot is to bring his niece\nand her cousin Milicent. I suppose my aunt thinks the latter will\nbenefit me by her society, and the salutary example of her gentle\ndeportment and lowly and tractable spirit; and the former I suspect she\nintends as a species of counter-attraction to win Mr. Huntingdon's\nattention from me. I don't thank her for this; but I shall be glad of\nMilicent's company: she is a sweet, good girl, and I wish I were like\nher\u2014_more_ like her, at least, than I am.\n* * * * *\n19th.\u2014They are come.

First came Mr. Wilmot and the ladies.\nWhen Milicent had got into her room, I quitted my post a few minutes to\nlook in upon her and have a little private conversation, for she was\nnow my intimate friend, several long epistles having passed between us\nsince our parting. On returning to my window, I beheld another carriage\nat the door. Was it his? No; it was Mr. Boarham's plain dark chariot;\nand there stood he upon the steps, carefully superintending the\ndislodging of his various boxes and packages. What a collection! One\nwould have thought he projected a visit of six months at least. A\nconsiderable time after, came Lord Lowborough in his barouche. Is he\none of the profligate friends, I wonder? I should think not; for no one\ncould call _him_ a jolly companion, I'm sure,\u2014and, besides, he appears\ntoo sober and gentlemanly in his demeanour to merit such suspicions. He\nis a tall, thin, gloomy-looking man, apparently between thirty and\nforty, and of a somewhat sickly, careworn aspect.\nAt last, Mr. Huntingdon's light phaeton came bowling merrily up the\nlawn. I had but a transient glimpse of him: for the moment it stopped,\nhe sprang out over the side on to the portico steps, and disappeared\ninto the house.\nI now submitted to be dressed for dinner\u2014a duty which Rachel had been\nurging upon me for the last twenty minutes; and when that important\nbusiness was completed, I repaired to the drawing-room, where I found\nMr. and Miss Wilmot and Milicent Hargrave already assembled. Shortly\nafter, Lord Lowborough entered, and then Mr. Boarham, who seemed quite\nwilling to forget and forgive my former conduct, and to hope that a\nlittle conciliation and steady perseverance on his part might yet\nsucceed in bringing me to reason. While I stood at the window,\nconversing with Milicent, he came up to me, and was beginning to talk\nin nearly his usual strain, when Mr. Huntingdon entered the room.\n\"How will he greet me, I wonder?\" said my bounding heart; and, instead\nof advancing to meet him, I turned to the window to hide or subdue my\nemotion. But having saluted his host and hostess, and the rest of the\ncompany, he came to me, ardently squeezed my hand, and murmured he was\nglad to see me once again. At that moment dinner was announced: my aunt\ndesired him to take Miss Hargrave into the dining-room, and odious Mr.\nWilmot, with unspeakable grimaces, offered his arm to me; and I was\ncondemned to sit between himself and Mr. Boarham. But afterwards, when\nwe were all again assembled in the drawing-room, I was indemnified for\nso much suffering by a few delightful minutes of conversation with Mr.\nHuntingdon.\nIn the course of the evening, Miss Wilmot was called upon to sing and\nplay for the amusement of the company, and I to exhibit my drawings,\nand, though he likes music, and she is an accomplished musician, I\nthink I am right in affirming, that he paid more attention to my\ndrawings than to her music.\nSo far so good;\u2014but hearing him pronounce, sotto voce, but with\npeculiar emphasis, concerning one of the pieces, \"THIS is better than\nall!\"\u2014I looked up, curious to see which it was, and, to my horror,\nbeheld him complacently gazing at the _back_ of the picture:\u2014it was his\nown face that I had sketched there and forgotten to rub out! To make\nmatters worse, in the agony of the moment, I attempted to snatch it\nfrom his hand; but he prevented me, and exclaiming, \"No\u2014by George, I'll\nkeep it!\" placed it against his waistcoat and buttoned his coat upon it\nwith a delighted chuckle.\nThen, drawing a candle close to his elbow, he gathered all the drawings\nto himself, as well what he had seen as the others, and muttering, \"I\nmust look at _both_ sides now,\" he eagerly commenced an examination,\nwhich I watched, at first, with tolerable composure, in the confidence\nthat his vanity would not be gratified by any further discoveries; for,\nthough I must plead guilty to having disfigured the backs of several\nwith abortive attempts to delineate that too fascinating physiognomy, I\nwas sure that, with that one unfortunate exception, I had carefully\nobliterated all such witnesses of my infatuation. But the pencil\nfrequently leaves an impression upon cardboard that no amount of\nrubbing can efface. Such, it seems, was the case with most of these;\nand, I confess, I trembled when I saw him holding them so close to the\ncandle, and poring so intently over the seeming blanks; but still, I\ntrusted, he would not be able to make out these dim traces to his own\nsatisfaction. I was mistaken, however. Having ended his scrutiny, he\nquietly remarked,\u2014\"I perceive the backs of young ladies' drawings, like\nthe postscripts of their letters, are the most important and\ninteresting part of the concern.\"\nThen, leaning back in his chair, he reflected a few minutes in silence,\ncomplacently smiling to himself, and while I was concocting some\ncutting speech wherewith to check his gratification, he rose, and\npassing over to where Annabella Wilmot sat vehemently coquetting with\nLord Lowborough, seated himself on the sofa beside her, and attached\nhimself to her for the rest of the evening.\n\"So then,\" thought I, \"he despises me, because he knows I love him.\"\nAnd the reflection made me so miserable I knew not what to do. Milicent\ncame and began to admire my drawings, and make remarks upon them; but I\ncould not talk to her\u2014I could talk to no one, and, upon the\nintroduction of tea, I took advantage of the open door and the slight\ndiversion caused by its entrance to slip out\u2014for I was sure I could not\ntake any\u2014and take refuge in the library. My aunt sent Thomas in quest\nof me, to ask if I were not coming to tea; but I bade him say I should\nnot take any to-night, and, happily, she was too much occupied with her\nguests to make any further inquiries at the time.",

And he favoured us all with a long and minute\ndisquisition upon the evils and dangers attendant upon damp feet,\ndelivered with the most imperturbable gravity, amid the jeers and\nlaughter of Mr. Huntingdon and my uncle, who, leaving the prudent\nsportsman to entertain the ladies with his medical discussions, sallied\nforth with their guns, bending their steps to the stables first, to\nhave a look at the horses and let out the dogs.\nNot desirous of sharing Mr. Boarham's company for the whole of the\nmorning, I betook myself to the library, and there brought forth my\neasel and began to paint. The easel and the painting apparatus would\nserve as an excuse for abandoning the drawing-room if my aunt should\ncome to complain of the desertion, and besides I wanted to finish the\npicture. It was one I had taken great pains with, and I intended it to\nbe my masterpiece, though it was somewhat presumptuous in the design.\nBy the bright azure of the sky, and by the warm and brilliant lights\nand deep long shadows, I had endeavoured to convey the idea of a sunny\nmorning. I had ventured to give more of the bright verdure of spring or\nearly summer to the grass and foliage than is commonly attempted in\npainting. The scene represented was an open glade in a wood. A group of\ndark Scotch firs was introduced in the middle distance to relieve the\nprevailing freshness of the rest; but in the foreground was part of the\ngnarled trunk and of the spreading boughs of a large forest-tree, whose\nfoliage was of a brilliant golden green\u2014not golden from autumnal\nmellowness, but from the sunshine and the very immaturity of the scarce\nexpanded leaves. Upon this bough, that stood out in bold relief against\nthe sombre firs, were seated an amorous pair of turtle doves, whose\nsoft sad-coloured plumage afforded a contrast of another nature; and\nbeneath it a young girl was kneeling on the daisy-spangled turf, with\nhead thrown back and masses of fair hair falling on her shoulders, her\nhands clasped, lips parted, and eyes intently gazing upward in pleased\nyet earnest contemplation of those feathered lovers\u2014too deeply absorbed\nin each other to notice her.\nI had scarcely settled to my work, which, however, wanted but a few\ntouches to the finishing, when the sportsmen passed the window on their\nreturn from the stables. It was partly open, and Mr. Huntingdon must\nhave seen me as he went by, for in half a minute he came back, and\nsetting his gun against the wall, threw up the sash and sprang in, and\nset himself before my picture.\n\"Very pretty, i'faith,\" said he, after attentively regarding it for a\nfew seconds; \"and a very fitting study for a young lady. Spring just\nopening into summer\u2014morning just approaching noon\u2014girlhood just\nripening into womanhood, and hope just verging on fruition. She's a\nsweet creature! but why didn't you make her black hair?\"\n\"I thought light hair would suit her better. You see I have made her\nblue-eyed and plump, and fair and rosy.\"\n\"Upon my word\u2014a very Hebe! I should fall in love with her if I hadn't\nthe artist before me. Sweet innocent! she's thinking there will come a\ntime when she will be wooed and won like that pretty hen-dove by as\nfond and fervent a lover; and she's thinking how pleasant it will be,\nand how tender and faithful he will find her.\"\n\"And perhaps,\" suggested I, \"how tender and faithful she shall find\nhim.\"\n\"Perhaps, for there is no limit to the wild extravagance of Hope's\nimaginings at such an age.\"\n\"Do you call _that_, then, one of her wild, extravagant delusions?\"\n\"No; my heart tells me it is not. I might have thought so once, but\nnow, I say, give me the girl I love, and I will swear eternal constancy\nto her and her alone, through summer and winter, through youth and age,\nand life and death! if age and death _must_ come.\"\nHe spoke this in such serious earnest that my heart bounded with\ndelight; but the minute after he changed his tone, and asked, with a\nsignificant smile, if I had \"any more portraits.\"\n\"No,\" replied I, reddening with confusion and wrath.\nBut my portfolio was on the table: he took it up, and coolly sat down\nto examine its contents.\n\"Mr. Huntingdon, those are my unfinished sketches,\" cried I, \"and I\nnever let any one see them.\"\nAnd I placed my hand on the portfolio to wrest it from him, but he\nmaintained his hold, assuring me that he \"liked unfinished sketches of\nall things.\"\n\"But I hate them to be seen,\" returned I. \"I can't let you have it,\nindeed!\"\n\"Let me have its bowels then,\" said he; and just as I wrenched the\nportfolio from his hand, he deftly abstracted the greater part of its\ncontents, and after turning them over a moment he cried out,\u2014\"Bless my\nstars, here's another;\" and slipped a small oval of ivory paper into\nhis waistcoat pocket\u2014a complete miniature portrait that I had sketched\nwith such tolerable success as to be induced to colour it with great\npains and care. But I was determined he should not keep it.\n\"Mr. Huntingdon,\" cried I, \"I _insist_ upon having that back! It is\nmine, and you have no _right_ to take it. Give it me directly\u2014I'll\nnever forgive you if you don't!\"\nBut the more vehemently I insisted, the more he aggravated my distress\nby his insulting, gleeful laugh. At length, however, he restored it to\nme, saying,\u2014\"Well, well, since you value it so much, I'll not deprive\nyou of it.\"\nTo show him how I valued it, I tore it in two and threw it into the\nfire. He was not prepared for this. His merriment suddenly ceasing, he\nstared in mute amazement at the consuming treasure; and then, with a\ncareless \"Humph! I'll go and shoot now,\" he turned on his heel and\nvacated the apartment by the window as he came, and setting on his hat\nwith an air, took up his gun and walked away, whistling as he went\u2014and\nleaving me not too much agitated to finish my picture, for I was glad,\nat the moment, that I had vexed him.",

Toil-spent and travel-stained,\nthe main body of them crossed over the grass to avoid us, but Mr.\nHuntingdon, all spattered and splashed as he was, and stained with the\nblood of his prey\u2014to the no small offence of my aunt's strict sense of\npropriety\u2014came out of his way to meet us, with cheerful smiles and\nwords for all but me, and placing himself between Annabella Wilmot and\nmyself, walked up the road and began to relate the various exploits and\ndisasters of the day, in a manner that would have convulsed me with\nlaughter if I had been on good terms with him; but he addressed himself\nentirely to Annabella, and I, of course, left all the laughter and all\nthe badinage to her, and affecting the utmost indifference to whatever\npassed between them, walked along a few paces apart, and looking every\nway but theirs, while my aunt and Milicent went before, linked arm in\narm and gravely discoursing together. At length Mr. Huntingdon turned\nto me, and addressing me in a confidential whisper, said,\u2014\"Helen, why\ndid you burn my picture?\"\n\"Because I wished to destroy it,\" I answered, with an asperity it is\nuseless now to lament.\n\"Oh, very good!\" was the reply; \"if _you_ don't value me, I must turn\nto somebody that will.\"\nI thought it was partly in jest\u2014a half-playful mixture of mock\nresignation and pretended indifference: but immediately he resumed his\nplace beside Miss Wilmot, and from that hour to this\u2014during all that\nevening, and all the next day, and the next, and the next, and all this\nmorning (the 22nd), he has never given me one kind word or one pleasant\nlook\u2014never spoken to me, but from pure necessity\u2014never glanced towards\nme but with a cold, unfriendly look I thought him quite incapable of\nassuming.\nMy aunt observes the change, and though she has not inquired the cause\nor made any remark to me on the subject, I see it gives her pleasure.\nMiss Wilmot observes it, too, and triumphantly ascribes it to her own\nsuperior charms and blandishments; but I am truly miserable\u2014more so\nthan I like to acknowledge to myself. Pride refuses to aid me. It has\nbrought me into the scrape, and will not help me out of it.\nHe meant no harm\u2014it was only his joyous, playful spirit; and I, by my\nacrimonious resentment\u2014so serious, so disproportioned to the\noffence\u2014have so wounded his feelings, so deeply offended him, that I\nfear he will never forgive me\u2014and all for a mere jest! He thinks I\ndislike him, and he must continue to think so. I must lose him for\never, and Annabella may win him, and triumph as she will.\nBut it is not my loss nor her triumph that I deplore so greatly as the\nwreck of my fond hopes for his advantage, and her unworthiness of his\naffection, and the injury he will do himself by trusting his happiness\nto her. _She_ does not love him: she thinks only of herself. She cannot\nappreciate the good that is in him: she will neither see it, nor value\nit, nor cherish it. She will neither deplore his faults nor attempt\ntheir amendment, but rather aggravate them by her own. And I doubt\nwhether she will not deceive him after all. I see she is playing double\nbetween him and Lord Lowborough, and while she amuses herself with the\nlively Huntingdon, she tries her utmost to enslave his moody friend;\nand should she succeed in bringing both to her feet, the fascinating\ncommoner will have but little chance against the lordly peer. If he\nobserves her artful by-play, it gives him no uneasiness, but rather\nadds new zest to his diversion by opposing a stimulating check to his\notherwise too easy conquest.\nMessrs. Wilmot and Boarham have severally taken occasion by his neglect\nof me to renew their advances; and if I were like Annabella and some\nothers I should take advantage of their perseverance to endeavour to\npique him into a revival of affection; but, justice and honesty apart,\nI could not _bear_ to do it. I am annoyed enough by their present\npersecutions without encouraging them further; and even if I did it\nwould have precious little effect upon him. He sees me suffering under\nthe condescending attentions and prosaic discourses of the one, and the\nrepulsive obtrusions of the other, without so much as a shadow of\ncommiseration for me, or resentment against my tormentors. He never\ncould have loved me, or he would not have resigned me so willingly, and\nhe would not go on talking to everybody else so cheerfully as he\ndoes\u2014laughing and jesting with Lord Lowborough and my uncle, teasing\nMilicent Hargrave, and flirting with Annabella Wilmot\u2014as if nothing\nwere on his mind. Oh! why can't I hate him? I must be infatuated, or I\nshould scorn to regret him as I do. But I must rally all the powers I\nhave remaining, and try to tear him from my heart. There goes the\ndinner-bell, and here comes my aunt to scold me for sitting here at my\ndesk all day, instead of staying with the company: wish the company",

I don't know what is come over me of\nlate; my very energies, both mental and physical, must be strangely\nimpaired, or I should not have acted so weakly in many respects as I\nhave done; but I have not been well this last day or two. I suppose it\nis with sleeping and eating so little, and thinking so much, and being\nso continually out of humour. But to return. I was exerting myself to\nsing and play for the amusement, and at the request, of my aunt and\nMilicent, before the gentlemen came into the drawing-room (Miss Wilmot\nnever likes to waste her musical efforts on ladies' ears alone).\nMilicent had asked for a little Scotch song, and I was just in the\nmiddle of it when they entered. The first thing Mr. Huntingdon did was\nto walk up to Annabella.\n\"Now, Miss Wilmot, won't _you_ give us some music to-night?\" said he.\n\"Do now! I know you will, when I tell you that I have been hungering\nand thirsting all day for the sound of your voice. Come! the piano's\nvacant.\"\nIt was, for I had quitted it immediately upon hearing his petition. Had\nI been endowed with a proper degree of self-possession, I should have\nturned to the lady myself, and cheerfully joined my entreaties to his,\nwhereby I should have disappointed his expectations, if the affront had\nbeen purposely given, or made him sensible of the wrong, if it had only\narisen from thoughtlessness; but I felt it too deeply to do anything\nbut rise from the music-stool, and throw myself back on the sofa,\nsuppressing with difficulty the audible expression of the bitterness I\nfelt within. I knew Annabella's musical talents were superior to mine,\nbut that was no reason why I should be treated as a perfect nonentity.\nThe time and the manner of his asking her appeared like a gratuitous\ninsult to me; and I could have wept with pure vexation.\nMeantime, she exultingly seated herself at the piano, and favoured him\nwith two of his favourite songs, in such superior style that even I\nsoon lost my anger in admiration, and listened with a sort of gloomy\npleasure to the skilful modulations of her full-toned and powerful\nvoice, so judiciously aided by her rounded and spirited touch; and\nwhile my ears drank in the sound, my eyes rested on the face of her\nprincipal auditor, and derived an equal or superior delight from the\ncontemplation of his speaking countenance, as he stood beside her\u2014that\neye and brow lighted up with keen enthusiasm, and that sweet smile\npassing and appearing like gleams of sunshine on an April day. No\nwonder he should hunger and thirst to hear her sing. I now forgave him\nfrom my heart his reckless slight of me, and I felt ashamed at my\npettish resentment of such a trifle\u2014ashamed too of those bitter envious\npangs that gnawed my inmost heart, in spite of all this admiration and\ndelight.",

It is still running in my\nhead, and so are the words:\u2014\nFarewell to thee! but not farewell\nTo all my fondest thoughts of thee:\nWithin my heart they still shall dwell;\nAnd they shall cheer and comfort me.\nO beautiful, and full of grace!\nIf thou hadst never met mine eye,\nI had not dreamed a living face\nCould fancied charms so far outvie.\nIf I may ne'er behold again\nThat form and face so dear to me,\nNor hear thy voice, still would I fain\nPreserve, for aye, their memory.\nThat voice, the magic of whose tone\nCan wake an echo in my breast,\nCreating feelings that, alone,\nCan make my tranced spirit blest.\nThat laughing eye, whose sunny beam\nMy memory would not cherish less;\u2014\nAnd oh, that smile! I whose joyous gleam\nNo mortal languish can express.\nAdieu! but let me cherish, still,\nThe hope with which I cannot part.\nContempt may wound, and coldness chill,\nBut still it lingers in my heart.\nAnd who can tell but Heaven, at last,\nMay answer all my thousand prayers,\nAnd bid the future pay the past\nWith joy for anguish, smiles for tears.\nWhen it ceased, I longed for nothing so much as to be out of the room.\nThe sofa was not far from the door, but I did not dare to raise my\nhead, for I knew Mr. Huntingdon was standing near me, and I knew by the\nsound of his voice, as he spoke in answer to some remark of Lord\nLowborough's, that his face was turned towards me. Perhaps a\nhalf-suppressed sob had caught his ear, and caused him to look\nround\u2014heaven forbid! But with a violent effort, I checked all further\nsigns of weakness, dried my tears, and, when I thought he had turned\naway again, rose, and instantly left the apartment, taking refuge in my",

I trusted it was only a servant, and did not stir. The door was\nclosed again\u2014but I was not alone; a hand gently touched my shoulder,\nand a voice said, softly,\u2014\"Helen, what is the matter?\"\nI could not answer at the moment.\n\"You must, and shall tell me,\" was added, more vehemently, and the\nspeaker threw himself on his knees beside me on the rug, and forcibly\npossessed himself of my hand; but I hastily caught it away, and\nreplied,\u2014\"It is nothing to you, Mr. Huntingdon.\"\n\"Are you sure it is nothing to me?\" he returned; \"can you swear that\nyou were not thinking of me while you wept?\" This was unendurable. I\nmade an effort to rise, but he was kneeling on my dress.\n\"Tell me,\" continued he\u2014\"I want to know,\u2014because if you were, I have\nsomething to say to you,\u2014and if not, I'll go.\"\n\"Go then!\" I cried; but, fearing he would obey too well, and never come\nagain, I hastily added\u2014\"Or say what you have to say, and have done with\nit!\"\n\"But which?\" said he\u2014\"for I shall only say it if you really were\nthinking of me. So tell me, Helen.\"\n\"You're excessively impertinent, Mr. Huntingdon!\"\n\"Not at all\u2014too pertinent, you mean. So you won't tell me?\u2014Well, I'll\nspare your woman's pride, and, construing your silence into 'Yes,' I'll\ntake it for granted that I was the subject of your thoughts, and the\ncause of your affliction\u2014\"\n\"Indeed, sir\u2014\"\n\"If you deny it, I won't tell you my secret,\" threatened he; and I did\nnot interrupt him again, or even attempt to repulse him: though he had\ntaken my hand once more, and half embraced me with his other arm, I was\nscarcely conscious of it at the time.\n\"It is this,\" resumed he: \"that Annabella Wilmot, in comparison with\nyou, is like a flaunting peony compared with a sweet, wild rosebud\ngemmed with dew\u2014and I love you to distraction!\u2014Now, tell me if that\nintelligence gives you any pleasure. Silence again? That means yes.\nThen let me add, that I cannot live without you, and if you answer No\nto this last question, you will drive me mad.\u2014Will you bestow yourself\nupon me?\u2014you will!\" he cried, nearly squeezing me to death in his arms.\n\"No, no!\" I exclaimed, struggling to free myself from him\u2014\"you must ask\nmy uncle and aunt.\"\n\"They won't refuse me, if you don't.\"\n\"I'm not so sure of that\u2014my aunt dislikes you.\"\n\"But _you_ don't, Helen\u2014say you love me, and I'll go.\"\n\"I wish you _would_ go!\" I replied.\n\"I will, this instant,\u2014if you'll only say you love me.\"\n\"You know I do,\" I answered. And again he caught me in his arms, and\nsmothered me with kisses.\nAt that moment my aunt opened wide the door, and stood before us,\ncandle in hand, in shocked and horrified amazement, gazing alternately\nat Mr. Huntingdon and me\u2014for we had both started up, and now stood wide\nenough asunder. But _his_ confusion was only for a moment. Rallying in\nan instant, with the most enviable assurance, he began,\u2014\"I beg ten\nthousand pardons, Mrs. Maxwell! Don't be too severe upon me. I've been\nasking your sweet niece to take me for better, for worse; and she, like\na good girl, informs me she cannot think of it without her uncle's and\naunt's consent. So let me implore you not to condemn me to eternal\nwretchedness: if _you_ favour my cause, I am safe; for Mr. Maxwell, I\nam certain, can refuse you nothing.\"\n\"We will talk of this to-morrow, sir,\" said my aunt, coldly. \"It is a\nsubject that demands mature and serious deliberation. At present, you\nhad better return to the drawing-room.\"\n\"But meantime,\" pleaded he, \"let me commend my cause to your most\nindulgent\u2014\"\n\"No indulgence for you, Mr. Huntingdon, must come between me and the\nconsideration of my niece's happiness.\"\n\"Ah, true! I know she is an angel, and I am a presumptuous dog to dream\nof possessing such a treasure; but, nevertheless, I would sooner die\nthan relinquish her in favour of the best man that ever went to\nheaven\u2014and as for her happiness, I would sacrifice my body and soul\u2014\"\n\"Body and _soul_, Mr. Huntingdon\u2014sacrifice your _soul?_\"\n\"Well, I would lay down life\u2014\"\n\"You would not be required to lay it down.\"\n\"I would spend it, then\u2014devote my life\u2014and all its powers to the\npromotion and preservation\u2014\"\n\"Another time, sir, we will talk of this\u2014and I should have felt\ndisposed to judge more favourably of your pretensions, if you too had\nchosen another time and place, and let me add\u2014another _manner_ for your\ndeclaration.\"\n\"Why, you see, Mrs. Maxwell,\" he began\u2014\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said she, with dignity\u2014\"The company are inquiring for\nyou in the other room.\" And she turned to me.\n\"Then _you_ must plead for me, Helen,\" said he, and at length withdrew.",

There may be a few mortgages on the rest\u2014a few\ntrifling debts and incumbrances here and there, but nothing to speak\nof; and though I acknowledge I am not so rich as I might be\u2014or have\nbeen\u2014still, I think, we could manage pretty comfortably on what's left.\nMy father, you know, was something of a miser, and in his latter days\nespecially saw no pleasure in life but to amass riches; and so it is no\nwonder that his son should make it his chief delight to spend them,\nwhich was accordingly the case, until my acquaintance with you, dear\nHelen, taught me other views and nobler aims. And the very idea of\nhaving you to care for under my roof would force me to moderate my\nexpenses and live like a Christian\u2014not to speak of all the prudence and\nvirtue you would instil into my mind by your wise counsels and sweet,\nattractive goodness.\"\n\"But it is not that,\" said I; \"it is not money my aunt thinks about.\nShe knows better than to value worldly wealth above its price.\"\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\"She wishes me to\u2014to marry none but a really good man.\"\n\"What, a man of 'decided piety'?\u2014ahem!\u2014Well, come, I'll manage that\ntoo! It's Sunday to-day, isn't it? I'll go to church morning,\nafternoon, and evening, and comport myself in such a godly sort that\nshe shall regard me with admiration and sisterly love, as a brand\nplucked from the burning. I'll come home sighing like a furnace, and\nfull of the savour and unction of dear Mr. Blatant's discourse\u2014\"\n\"Mr. Leighton,\" said I, dryly.\n\"Is Mr. Leighton a 'sweet preacher,' Helen\u2014a 'dear, delightful,\nheavenly-minded man'?\"\n\"He is a _good_ man, Mr. Huntingdon. I wish I could say half as much\nfor you.\"\n\"Oh, I forgot, you are a saint, too. I crave your pardon, dearest\u2014but\ndon't call me Mr. Huntingdon; my name is Arthur.\"\n\"I'll call you nothing\u2014for I'll have nothing at all to do with you if\nyou talk in that way any more. If you really mean to deceive my aunt as\nyou say, you are very wicked; and if not, you are very wrong to jest on\nsuch a subject.\"\n\"I stand corrected,\" said he, concluding his laugh with a sorrowful\nsigh. \"Now,\" resumed he, after a momentary pause, \"let us talk about\nsomething else. And come nearer to me, Helen, and take my arm; and then\nI'll let you alone. I can't be quiet while I see you walking there.\"\nI complied; but said we must soon return to the house.\n\"No one will be down to breakfast yet, for long enough,\" he answered.\n\"You spoke of your guardians just now, Helen, but is not your father\nstill living?\"\n\"Yes, but I always look upon my uncle and aunt as my guardians, for\nthey are so in deed, though not in name. My father has entirely given\nme up to their care. I have never seen him since dear mamma died, when\nI was a very little girl, and my aunt, at her request, offered to take\ncharge of me, and took me away to Staningley, where I have remained\never since; and I don't think he would object to anything for me that\nshe thought proper to sanction.\"\n\"But would he sanction anything to which she thought proper to object?\"\n\"No, I don't think he cares enough about me.\"\n\"He is very much to blame\u2014but he doesn't know what an angel he has for\nhis daughter\u2014which is all the better for me, as, if he did, he would\nnot be willing to part with such a treasure.\"\n\"And Mr. Huntingdon,\" said I, \"I suppose you _know_ I am not an\nheiress?\"\nHe protested he had never given it a thought, and begged I would not\ndisturb his present enjoyment by the mention of such uninteresting\nsubjects. I was glad of this proof of disinterested affection; for\nAnnabella Wilmot is the probable heiress to all her uncle's wealth, in\naddition to her late father's property, which she has already in\npossession.\nI now insisted upon retracing our steps to the house; but we walked\nslowly, and went on talking as we proceeded. I need not repeat all we\nsaid: let me rather refer to what passed between my aunt and me, after",

There is Walter Hargrave,\nMilicent's brother, for one: he is but a little lower than the angels,\nif half she says of him is true. She is continually talking to me about\nhim, and lauding his many virtues to the skies.\"\n\"You will form a very inadequate estimate of a man's character,\"\nreplied she, \"if you judge by what a fond sister says of him. The worst\nof them generally know how to hide their misdeeds from their sisters'\neyes, and their mother's, too.\"\n\"And there is Lord Lowborough,\" continued I, \"quite a decent man.\"\n\"Who told you so? Lord Lowborough is a _desperate_ man. He has\ndissipated his fortune in gambling and other things, and is now seeking\nan heiress to retrieve it. I told Miss Wilmot so; but you're all alike:\nshe haughtily answered she was very much obliged to me, but she\nbelieved _she_ knew when a man was seeking her for her fortune, and\nwhen for herself; she flattered herself she had had experience enough\nin those matters to be justified in trusting to her own judgment\u2014and as\nfor his lordship's lack of fortune, she cared nothing about that, as\nshe hoped her own would suffice for both; and as for his wildness, she\nsupposed he was no worse than others\u2014besides, he was reformed now. Yes,\nthey can all play the hypocrite when they want to take in a fond,\nmisguided woman!\"\n\"Well, I think he's about as good as she is,\" said I. \"But when Mr.\nHuntingdon is married, he won't have many opportunities of consorting\nwith his bachelor friends;\u2014and the worse they are, the more I long to\ndeliver him from them.\"\n\"To be sure, my dear; and the worse _he_ is, I suppose, the more you\nlong to deliver him from himself.\"\n\"Yes, provided he is not incorrigible\u2014that is, the more I long to\ndeliver him from his faults\u2014to give him an opportunity of shaking off\nthe adventitious evil got from contact with others worse than himself,\nand shining out in the unclouded light of his own genuine goodness\u2014to\ndo my utmost to help his better self against his worse, and make him\nwhat he would have been if he had not, from the beginning, had a bad,\nselfish, miserly father, who, to gratify his own sordid passions,\nrestricted him in the most innocent enjoyments of childhood and youth,\nand so disgusted him with every kind of restraint;\u2014and a foolish mother\nwho indulged him to the top of his bent, deceiving her husband for him,\nand doing her utmost to encourage those germs of folly and vice it was\nher duty to suppress,\u2014and then, such a set of companions as you\nrepresent his friends to be\u2014\"\n\"Poor man!\" said she, sarcastically, \"his kind have greatly wronged\nhim!\"\n\"They have!\" cried I\u2014\"and they shall wrong him no more\u2014his wife shall\nundo what his mother did!\"\n\"Well,\" said she, after a short pause, \"I must say, Helen, I thought\nbetter of your judgment than this\u2014and your taste too. How you can love\nsuch a man I cannot tell, or what pleasure you can find in his company;\nfor 'what fellowship hath light with darkness; or he that believeth\nwith an infidel?'\"\n\"He is not an infidel;\u2014and I am not light, and he is not darkness; his\nworst and only vice is thoughtlessness.\"\n\"And thoughtlessness,\" pursued my aunt, \"may lead to every crime, and\nwill but poorly excuse our errors in the sight of God. Mr. Huntingdon,\nI suppose, is not without the common faculties of men: he is not so\nlight-headed as to be irresponsible: his Maker has endowed him with\nreason and conscience as well as the rest of us; the Scriptures are\nopen to him as well as to others;\u2014and 'if he hear not them, neither\nwill he hear though one rose from the dead.' And remember, Helen,\"\ncontinued she, solemnly, \"'the wicked shall be turned into hell, and\nthey that _forget_ God!'\" And suppose, even, that he should continue to\nlove you, and you him, and that you should pass through life together\nwith tolerable comfort\u2014how will it be in the end, when you see\nyourselves parted for ever; you, perhaps, taken into eternal bliss, and\nhe cast into the lake that burneth with unquenchable fire\u2014there for\never to\u2014\"\n\"Not for ever,\" I exclaimed, \"'only till he has paid the uttermost\nfarthing;' for 'if any man's work abide not the fire, he shall suffer\nloss, yet himself shall be saved, but so as by fire;' and He that 'is\nable to subdue all things to Himself will have all men to be saved,'\nand 'will, in the fulness of time, gather together in one all things in\nChrist Jesus, who tasted death for every man, and in whom God will\nreconcile all things to Himself, whether they be things in earth or\nthings in heaven.'\"\n\"Oh, Helen! where did you learn all this?\"\n\"In the Bible, aunt. I have searched it through, and found nearly\nthirty passages, all tending to support the same theory.\"\n\"And is _that_ the use you make of your Bible? And did you find no\npassages tending to prove the danger and the falsity of such a belief?\"\n\"No: I found, indeed, some passages that, taken by themselves, might\nseem to contradict that opinion; but they will all bear a different\nconstruction to that which is commonly given, and in most the only\ndifficulty is in the word which we translate 'everlasting' or\n'eternal.' I don't know the Greek, but I believe it strictly means for\nages, and might signify either endless or long-enduring. And as for the\ndanger of the belief, I would not publish it abroad if I thought any\npoor wretch would be likely to presume upon it to his own destruction,\nbut it is a glorious thought to cherish in one's own heart, and I would\nnot part with it for all the world can give!\"\nHere our conference ended, for it was now high time to prepare for",

I\nhaven't had time, yet, to examine thoroughly into this young rascal's\naffairs, but I see that a great part of his father's fine property has\nbeen squandered away;\u2014but still, I think, there's a pretty fair share\nof it left, and a little careful nursing may make a handsome thing of\nit yet; and then we must persuade your father to give you a decent\nfortune, as he has only one besides yourself to care for;\u2014and, if you\nbehave well, who knows but what I may be induced to remember you in my\nwill!\" continued he, putting his fingers to his nose, with a knowing\nwink.\n\"Thanks, uncle, for that and all your kindness,\" replied I.\n\"Well, and I questioned this young spark on the matter of settlements,\"\ncontinued he; \"and he seemed disposed to be generous enough on that\npoint\u2014\"\n\"I knew he would!\" said I. \"But pray don't trouble your head\u2014or his, or\nmine about that; for all I have will be his, and all he has will be\nmine; and what more could either of us require?\" And I was about to\nmake my exit, but he called me back.\n\"Stop, stop!\" cried he; \"we haven't mentioned the time yet. When must\nit be? Your aunt would put it off till the Lord knows when, but he is\nanxious to be bound as soon as may be: he won't hear of waiting beyond\nnext month; and you, I guess, will be of the same mind, so\u2014\"\n\"Not at all, uncle; on the contrary, I should like to wait till after\nChristmas, at least.\"\n\"Oh! pooh, pooh! never tell me that tale\u2014I know better,\" cried he; and\nhe persisted in his incredulity. Nevertheless, it is quite true. I am\nin no hurry at all. How can I be, when I think of the momentous change\nthat awaits me, and of all I have to leave? It is happiness enough to\nknow that we _are_ to be united; and that he really loves me, and I may\nlove _him_ as devotedly, and think of him as often as I please.\nHowever, I insisted upon consulting my aunt about the _time_ of the\nwedding, for I determined her counsels should not be utterly\ndisregarded; and no conclusions on that particular are come to yet.",

My father has given his consent, and\nthe time is fixed for Christmas, by a sort of compromise between the\nrespective advocates for hurry and delay. Milicent Hargrave is to be\none bridesmaid and Annabella Wilmot the other\u2014not that I am\nparticularly fond of the latter, but she is an intimate of the family,\nand I have not another friend.\nWhen I told Milicent of my engagement, she rather provoked me by her\nmanner of taking it. After staring a moment in mute surprise, she\nsaid,\u2014\n\"Well, Helen, I suppose I ought to congratulate you\u2014and I _am_ glad to\nsee you so happy; but I did not think you would take him; and I can't\nhelp feeling surprised that you should like him so much.\"\n\"Why so?\"\n\"Because you are so superior to him in every way, and there's something\nso bold and reckless about him\u2014so, I don't know how\u2014but I always feel a\nwish to get out of his way when I see him approach.\"\n\"You are timid, Milicent; but that's no fault of his.\"\n\"And then his look,\" continued she. \"People say he's handsome, and of\ncourse he is; but _I_ don't _like_ that kind of beauty, and I wonder\nthat you should.\"\n\"Why so, pray?\"\n\"Well, you know, I think there's nothing noble or lofty in his\nappearance.\"\n\"In fact, you wonder that I can like any one so unlike the stilted\nheroes of romance. Well, give me my flesh and blood lover, and I'll\nleave all the Sir Herberts and Valentines to you\u2014if you can find them.\"\n\"I don't want them,\" said she. \"I'll be satisfied with flesh and blood\ntoo\u2014only the spirit must shine through and predominate. But don't you\nthink Mr. Huntingdon's face is too red?\"\n\"No!\" cried I, indignantly. \"It is not red at all. There is just a\npleasant glow, a healthy freshness in his complexion\u2014the warm, pinky\ntint of the whole harmonising with the deeper colour of the cheeks,\nexactly as it ought to do. I hate a man to be red and white, like a\npainted doll, or all sickly white, or smoky black, or cadaverous\nyellow.\"\n\"Well, tastes differ\u2014but _I_ like pale or dark,\" replied she. \"But, to\ntell you the truth, Helen, I had been deluding myself with the hope\nthat you would one day be my sister. I expected Walter would be\nintroduced to you next season; and I thought you would like him, and\nwas certain he would like you; and I flattered myself I should thus\nhave the felicity of seeing the two persons I like best in the\nworld\u2014except mamma\u2014united in one. He mayn't be exactly what you would\ncall handsome, but he's far more distinguished-looking, and nicer and\nbetter than Mr. Huntingdon;\u2014and I'm sure you would say so, if you knew\nhim.\"\n\"Impossible, Milicent! You think so, because you're his sister; and, on\nthat account, I'll forgive you; but nobody else should so disparage\nArthur Huntingdon to me with impunity.\"\nMiss Wilmot expressed her feelings on the subject almost as openly.\n\"And so, Helen,\" said she, coming up to me with a smile of no amiable\nimport, \"you are to be Mrs. Huntingdon, I suppose?\"\n\"Yes,\" replied I. \"Don't you envy me?\"\n\"Oh, _dear_, no!\" she exclaimed. \"I shall probably be Lady Lowborough\nsome day, and then you know, dear, I shall be in a capacity to inquire,\n'Don't you envy _me?_'\"\n\"Henceforth I shall envy no one,\" returned I.\n\"Indeed! Are you so happy then?\" said she, thoughtfully; and something\nvery like a cloud of disappointment shadowed her face. \"And does he\nlove you\u2014I mean, does he idolise you as much as you do him?\" she added,\nfixing her eyes upon me with ill-disguised anxiety for the reply.\n\"I don't want to be idolised,\" I answered; \"but I am well assured that\nhe _loves_ me more than anybody else in the world\u2014as I do him.\"\n\"Exactly,\" said she, with a nod. \"I wish\u2014\" she paused.\n\"What do you wish?\" asked I, annoyed at the vindictive expression of\nher countenance.\n\"I wish,\" returned, she, with a short laugh, \"that all the attractive\npoints and desirable qualifications of the two gentlemen were united in\none\u2014that Lord Lowborough had Huntingdon's handsome face and good\ntemper, and all his wit, and mirth and charm, or else that Huntingdon\nhad Lowborough's pedigree, and title, and delightful old family seat,\nand I had him; and you might have the other and welcome.\"\n\"Thank you, dear Annabella: I am better satisfied with things as they\nare, for my own part; and for you, I wish you were as well content with\nyour intended as I am with mine,\" said I; and it was true enough; for,\nthough vexed at first at her unamiable spirit, her frankness touched\nme, and the contrast between our situations was such, that I could well\nafford to pity her and wish her well.",

This morning's post brought him letters\nfrom several of his friends, during the perusal of which, at the\nbreakfast-table, he excited the attention of the company by the\nsingular variety of his grimaces. But he crushed them all into his\npocket, with a private laugh, and said nothing till the meal was\nconcluded. Then, while the company were hanging over the fire or\nloitering through the room, previous to settling to their various\nmorning avocations, he came and leant over the back of my chair, with\nhis face in contact with my curls, and commencing with a quiet little\nkiss, poured forth the following complaints into my ear:\u2014\n\"Helen, you witch, do you know that you've entailed upon me the curses\nof all my friends? I wrote to them the other day, to tell them of my\nhappy prospects, and now, instead of a bundle of congratulations, I've\ngot a pocketful of bitter execrations and reproaches. There's not one\nkind wish for me, or one good word for you, among them all. They say\nthere'll be no more fun now, no more merry days and glorious nights\u2014and\nall my fault\u2014I am the first to break up the jovial band, and others, in\npure despair, will follow my example. I was the very life and prop of\nthe community, they do me the honour to say, and I have shamefully\nbetrayed my trust\u2014\"\n\"You may join them again, if you like,\" said I, somewhat piqued at the\nsorrowful tone of his discourse. \"I should be sorry to stand between\nany man\u2014or body of men, and so much happiness; and perhaps I can manage\nto do without you, as well as your poor deserted friends.\"\n\"Bless you, no,\" murmured he. \"It's 'all for love or the world well\nlost,' with me. Let them go to\u2014where they belong, to speak politely.\nBut if you saw how they abuse me, Helen, you would love me all the more\nfor having ventured so much for your sake.\"\nHe pulled out his crumpled letters. I thought he was going to show them\nto me, and told him I did not wish to see them.\n\"I'm not going to show them to you, love,\" said he. \"They're hardly fit\nfor a lady's eyes\u2014the most part of them. But look here. This is\nGrimsby's scrawl\u2014only three lines, the sulky dog! He doesn't say much,\nto be sure, but his very silence implies more than all the others'\nwords, and the less he says, the more he thinks\u2014and this is Hargrave's\nmissive. He is particularly grieved at me, because, forsooth he had\nfallen in love with you from his sister's reports, and meant to have\nmarried you himself, as soon as he had sown his wild oats.\"\n\"I'm vastly obliged to him,\" observed I.\n\"And so am I,\" said he. \"And look at this. This is Hattersley's\u2014every\npage stuffed full of railing accusations, bitter curses, and lamentable\ncomplaints, ending up with swearing that he'll get married himself in\nrevenge: he'll throw himself away on the first old maid that chooses to\nset her cap at him,\u2014as if _I_ cared what he did with himself.\"\n\"Well,\" said I, \"if you do give up your intimacy with these men, I\ndon't think you will have much cause to regret the loss of their\nsociety; for it's my belief they never did you much good.\"\n\"Maybe not; but we'd a merry time of it, too, though mingled with\nsorrow and pain, as Lowborough knows to his cost\u2014Ha, ha!\" and while he\nwas laughing at the recollection of Lowborough's troubles, my uncle\ncame and slapped him on the shoulder.\n\"Come, my lad!\" said he. \"Are you too busy making love to my niece to\nmake war with the pheasants?\u2014First of October, remember! Sun shines\nout\u2014rain ceased\u2014even Boarham's not afraid to venture in his waterproof\nboots; and Wilmot and I are going to beat you all. I declare, we old\n'uns are the keenest sportsmen of the lot!\"\n\"I'll show you what I can do to-day, however,\" said my companion. \"I'll\nmurder your birds by wholesale, just for keeping me away from better\ncompany than either you or them.\"\nAnd so saying he departed; and I saw no more of him till dinner.

He thought he never\ncould be again, but he's in for it once more. He was to have been\nmarried before, some two or three years ago; but he lost his bride by\nlosing his fortune. He got into a bad way among us in London: he had an\nunfortunate taste for gambling; and surely the fellow was born under an\nunlucky star, for he always lost thrice where he gained once. That's a\nmode of self-torment I never was much addicted to. When I spend my\nmoney I like to enjoy the full value of it: I see no fun in wasting it\non thieves and blacklegs; and as for _gaining_ money, hitherto I have\nalways had sufficient; it's time enough to be clutching for more, I\nthink, when you begin to see the end of what you have. But I have\nsometimes frequented the gaming-houses just to watch the on-goings of\nthose mad votaries of chance\u2014a very interesting study, I assure you,\nHelen, and sometimes very diverting: I've had many a laugh at the\nboobies and bedlamites. Lowborough was quite infatuated\u2014not willingly,\nbut of necessity,\u2014he was always resolving to give it up, and always\nbreaking his resolutions. Every venture was the \"just once more:\" if he\ngained a little, he hoped to gain a little more next time, and if he\nlost, it would not do to leave off at that juncture; he must go on till\nhe had retrieved that last misfortune, at least: bad luck could not\nlast for ever; and every lucky hit was looked upon as the dawn of\nbetter times, till experience proved the contrary. At length he grew\ndesperate, and we were daily on the look-out for a case of\n_felo-de-se_\u2014no great matter, some of us whispered, as his existence\nhad ceased to be an acquisition to our club. At last, however, he came\nto a check. He made a large stake, which he determined should be the\nlast, whether he lost or won. He had often so determined before, to be\nsure, and as often broken his determination; and so it was this time.\nHe lost; and while his antagonist smilingly swept away the stakes, he\nturned chalky white, drew back in silence, and wiped his forehead. I\nwas present at the time; and while he stood with folded arms and eyes\nfixed on the ground, I knew well enough what was passing in his mind.\n\"'Is it to be the last, Lowborough?' said I, stepping up to him.\n\"'The last but ONE,' he answered, with a grim smile; and then, rushing\nback to the table, he struck his hand upon it, and, raising his voice\nhigh above all the confusion of jingling coins and muttered oaths and\ncurses in the room, he swore a deep and solemn oath that, come what\nwould, THIS trial _should_ be the last, and imprecated unspeakable\ncurses on his head if ever he should shuffle a card or rattle a\ndice-box again. He then doubled his former stake, and challenged any\none present to play against him. Grimsby instantly presented himself.\nLowborough glared fiercely at him, for Grimsby was almost as celebrated\nfor his luck as _he_ was for his ill-fortune. However, they fell to\nwork. But Grimsby had much skill and little scruple, and whether he\ntook advantage of the other's trembling, blinded eagerness to deal\nunfairly by him, I cannot undertake to say; but Lowborough lost again,\nand fell dead sick.\n\"'You'd better try once more,' said Grimsby, leaning across the table.\nAnd then he winked at me.\n\"'I've nothing to try with,' said the poor devil, with a ghastly smile.\n\"'Oh, Huntingdon will lend you what you want,' said the other.\n\"'No; you heard my oath,' answered Lowborough, turning away in quiet\ndespair. And I took him by the arm and led him out.\n\"'Is it to be the last, Lowborough?' I asked, when I got him into the\nstreet.\n\"'The last,' he answered, somewhat against my expectation. And I took\nhim home\u2014that is, to our club\u2014for he was as submissive as a child\u2014and\nplied him with brandy-and-water till he began to look rather\nbrighter\u2014rather more alive, at least.\n\"'Huntingdon, I'm ruined!' said he, taking the third glass from my\nhand\u2014he had drunk the others in dead silence.\n\"'Not you,' said I. 'You'll find a man can live without his money as\nmerrily as a tortoise without its head, or a wasp without its body.'\n\"'But I'm in debt,' said he\u2014'deep in debt. And I can never, _never_ get\nout of it.'\n\"'Well, what of that? Many a better man than you has lived and died in\ndebt; and they can't put you in prison, you know, because you're a\npeer.' And I handed him his fourth tumbler.\n\"'But I hate to be in debt!' he shouted. 'I wasn't born for it, and I\ncannot _bear_ it.'\n\"'What can't be cured must be endured,' said I, beginning to mix the\nfifth.\n\"'And then, I've lost my Caroline.' And he began to snivel then, for\nthe brandy had softened his heart.\n\"'No matter,' I answered, 'there are more Carolines in the world than\none.'\n\"'There's only one for me,' he replied, with a dolorous sigh. 'And if\nthere were fifty more, who's to get them, I wonder, without money?'\n\"'Oh, somebody will take you for your title; and then you've your\nfamily estate yet; that's entailed, you know.'\n\"'I wish to God I could sell it to pay my debts,' he muttered.\n\"'And then,' said Grimsby, who had just come in, 'you can _try again_,\nyou know. I _would_ have more than one chance, if I were you. I'd never\nstop here.'\n\"'I _won't_, I tell you!' shouted he. And he started up, and left the\nroom\u2014walking rather unsteadily, for the liquor had got into his head.\nHe was not so much used to it then, but after that he took to it kindly\nto solace his cares.\n\"He kept his oath about gambling (not a little to the surprise of us\nall), though Grimsby did his utmost to tempt him to break it, but now\nhe had got hold of another habit that bothered him nearly as much, for\nhe soon discovered that the demon of drink was as black as the demon of\nplay, and nearly as hard to get rid of\u2014especially as his kind friends\ndid all they could to second the promptings of his own insatiable\ncravings.\"",

Even\nGrimsby could chuckle over his odd sayings: they delighted him far more\nthan my merry jests, or Hattersley's riotous mirth. But one evening,\nwhen we were sitting over our wine, after one of our club dinners, and\nall had been hearty together,\u2014Lowborough giving us mad toasts, and\nhearing our wild songs, and bearing a hand in the applause, if he did\nnot help us to sing them himself,\u2014he suddenly relapsed into silence,\nsinking his head on his hand, and never lifting his glass to his\nlips;\u2014but this was nothing new; so we let him alone, and went on with\nour jollification, till, suddenly raising his head, he interrupted us\nin the middle of a roar of laughter by exclaiming,\u2014\n\"Gentlemen, where is all this to end?\u2014Will you just tell me _that_\nnow?\u2014Where is it all to end?\" He rose.\n\"'A speech, a speech!' shouted we. 'Hear, hear! Lowborough's going to\ngive us a speech!'\n\"He waited calmly till the thunders of applause and jingling of glasses\nhad ceased, and then proceeded,\u2014'It's only this, gentlemen,\u2014that I\nthink we'd better go no further. We'd better stop while we can.'\n\"'Just so!' cried Hattersley\u2014\n'Stop poor sinner, stop and think\nBefore you farther go,\nNo longer sport upon the brink\nOf everlasting woe.'\n\"'Exactly!' replied his lordship, with the utmost gravity. 'And if\n_you_ choose to visit the bottomless pit, I won't go with you\u2014we must\npart company, for I swear I'll not move another step towards it!\u2014What's\nthis?' he said, taking up his glass of wine.\n\"'Taste it,' suggested I.\n\"'This is hell broth!' he exclaimed. 'I renounce it for ever!' And he\nthrew it out into the middle of the table.\n\"'Fill again!' said I, handing him the bottle\u2014'and let us drink to your\nrenunciation.'\n\"'It's rank poison,' said he, grasping the bottle by the neck, 'and I\nforswear it! I've given up gambling, and I'll give up this too.' He was\non the point of deliberately pouring the whole contents of the bottle\non to the table, but Hargrave wrested it from him. 'On you be the\ncurse, then!' said he. And, backing from the room, he shouted,\n'Farewell, ye tempters!' and vanished amid shouts of laughter and\napplause.\n\"We expected him back among us the next day; but, to our surprise, the\nplace remained vacant: we saw nothing of him for a whole week; and we\nreally began to think he was going to keep his word. At last, one\nevening, when we were most of us assembled together again, he entered,\nsilent and grim as a ghost, and would have quietly slipped into his\nusual seat at my elbow, but we all rose to welcome him, and several\nvoices were raised to ask what he would have, and several hands were\nbusy with bottle and glass to serve him; but I knew a smoking tumbler\nof brandy-and-water would comfort him best, and had nearly prepared it,\nwhen he peevishly pushed it away, saying,\u2014\n\"'Do let me alone, Huntingdon! Do be quiet, all of you! I'm not come to\njoin you: I'm only come to be with you awhile, because I can't bear my\nown thoughts.' And he folded his arms, and leant back in his chair; so\nwe let him be. But I left the glass by him; and, after awhile, Grimsby\ndirected my attention towards it, by a significant wink; and, on\nturning my head, I saw it was drained to the bottom. He made me a sign\nto replenish, and quietly pushed up the bottle. I willingly complied;\nbut Lowborough detected the pantomime, and, nettled at the intelligent\ngrins that were passing between us, snatched the glass from my hand,\ndashed the contents of it in Grimsby's face, threw the empty tumbler at\nme, and then bolted from the room.\"\n\"I hope he broke your head,\" said I.\n\"No, love,\" replied he, laughing immoderately at the recollection of\nthe whole affair; \"he would have done so,\u2014and perhaps, spoilt my face,\ntoo, but, providentially, this forest of curls\" (taking off his hat,\nand showing his luxuriant chestnut locks) \"saved my skull, and\nprevented the glass from breaking, till it reached the table.\"\n\"After that,\" he continued, \"Lowborough kept aloof from us a week or\ntwo longer. I used to meet him occasionally in the town; and then, as I\nwas too good-natured to resent his unmannerly conduct, and he bore no\nmalice against me,\u2014he was never unwilling to talk to me; on the\ncontrary, he would cling to me, and follow me anywhere but to the club,\nand the gaming-houses, and such-like dangerous places of resort\u2014he was\nso weary of his own moping, melancholy mind. At last, I got him to come\nin with me to the club, on condition that I would not tempt him to\ndrink; and, for some time, he continued to look in upon us pretty\nregularly of an evening,\u2014still abstaining, with wonderful perseverance,\nfrom the 'rank poison' he had so bravely forsworn. But some of our\nmembers protested against this conduct. They did not like to have him\nsitting there like a skeleton at a feast, instead of contributing his\nquota to the general amusement, casting a cloud over all, and watching,\nwith greedy eyes, every drop they carried to their lips\u2014they vowed it\nwas not fair; and some of them maintained that he should either be\ncompelled to do as others did, or expelled from the society; and swore\nthat, next time he showed himself, they would tell him as much, and, if\nhe did not take the warning, proceed to active measures. However, I\nbefriended him on this occasion, and recommended them to let him be for\na while, intimating that, with a little patience on our parts, he would\nsoon come round again. But, to be sure, it _was_ rather provoking; for,\nthough he refused to drink like an honest Christian, it was well known\nto me that he kept a private bottle of laudanum about him, which he was\ncontinually soaking at\u2014or rather, holding off and on with, abstaining\none day and exceeding the next\u2014just like the spirits.\n\"One night, however, during one of our orgies\u2014one of our high\nfestivals, I mean\u2014he glided in, like the ghost in 'Macbeth,' and seated\nhimself, as usual, a little back from the table, in the chair we always\nplaced for 'the spectre,' whether it chose to fill it or not. I saw by\nhis face that he was suffering from the effects of an overdose of his\ninsidious comforter; but nobody spoke to him, and he spoke to nobody. A\nfew sidelong glances, and a whispered observation, that 'the ghost was\ncome,' was all the notice he drew by his appearance, and we went on\nwith our merry carousals as before, till he startled us all by suddenly\ndrawing in his chair, and leaning forward with his elbows on the table,\nand exclaiming with portentous solemnity,\u2014\n'Well! it puzzles me what you can find to be so merry about. What _you_\nsee in life I don't know\u2014_I_ see only the blackness of darkness, and a\nfearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation!'\n\"All the company simultaneously pushed up their glasses to him, and I\nset them before him in a semicircle, and, tenderly patting him on the\nback, bid him drink, and he would soon see as bright a prospect as any\nof us; but he pushed them back, muttering,\u2014\n\"'Take them away! I won't taste it, I tell you. I won't\u2014I won't!' So I\nhanded them down again to the owners; but I saw that he followed them\nwith a glare of hungry regret as they departed. Then he clasped his\nhands before his eyes to shut out the sight, and two minutes after\nlifted his head again, and said, in a hoarse but vehement whisper,\u2014\n\"'And yet I must! Huntingdon, get me a glass!'\n\"'Take the bottle, man!' said I, thrusting the brandy-bottle into his\nhand\u2014but stop, I'm telling too much,\" muttered the narrator, startled\nat the look I turned upon him. \"But no matter,\" he recklessly added,\nand thus continued his relation: \"In his desperate eagerness, he seized\nthe bottle and sucked away, till he suddenly dropped from his chair,\ndisappearing under the table amid a tempest of applause. The\nconsequence of this imprudence was something like an apoplectic fit,\nfollowed by a rather severe brain fever\u2014\"\n\"And what did you think of _yourself_, sir?\" said I, quickly.\n\"Of course, I was very penitent,\" he replied. \"I went to see him once\nor twice\u2014nay, twice or thrice\u2014or by'r lady, some four times\u2014and when he\ngot better, I tenderly brought him back to the fold.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I mean, I restored him to the bosom of the club, and compassionating\nthe feebleness of his health and extreme lowness of his spirits, I\nrecommended him to 'take a little wine for his stomach's sake,' and,\nwhen he was sufficiently re-established, to embrace the media-via,\nni-jamais-ni-toujours plan\u2014not to kill himself like a fool, and not to\nabstain like a ninny\u2014in a word, to enjoy himself like a rational\ncreature, and do as I did; for, don't think, Helen, that I'm a tippler;\nI'm nothing at all of the kind, and never was, and never shall be. I\nvalue my comfort far too much. I see that a man cannot give himself up\nto drinking without being miserable one-half his days and mad the\nother; besides, I like to enjoy my life at all sides and ends, which\ncannot be done by one that suffers himself to be the slave of a single\npropensity\u2014and, moreover, drinking spoils one's good looks,\" he\nconcluded, with a most conceited smile that ought to have provoked me\nmore than it did.",

            "text": "\"And did Lord Lowborough profit by your advice?\" I asked.\n\"Why, yes, in a manner. For a while he managed very well; indeed, he\nwas a model of moderation and prudence\u2014something too much so for the\ntastes of our wild community; but, somehow, Lowborough had not the gift\nof moderation: if he stumbled a little to one side, he must go down\nbefore he could right himself: if he overshot the mark one night, the\neffects of it rendered him so miserable the next day that he must\nrepeat the offence to mend it; and so on from day to day, till his\nclamorous conscience brought him to a stand. And then, in his sober\nmoments, he so bothered his friends with his remorse, and his terrors\nand woes, that they were obliged, in self-defence, to get him to drown\nhis sorrows in wine, or any more potent beverage that came to hand; and\nwhen his first scruples of conscience were overcome, he would need no\nmore persuading, he would often grow desperate, and be as great a\nblackguard as any of them could desire\u2014but only to lament his own\nunutterable wickedness and degradation the more when the fit was over.\n\"At last, one day when he and I were alone together, after pondering\nawhile in one of his gloomy, abstracted moods, with his arms folded and\nhis head sunk on his breast, he suddenly woke up, and vehemently\ngrasping my arm, said,\u2014\n\"'Huntingdon, this won't do! I'm resolved to have done with it.'\n\"'What, are you going to shoot yourself?' said I.\n\"'No; I'm going to reform.'\n\"'Oh, _that's_ nothing new! You've been going to reform these twelve\nmonths and more.'\n\"'Yes, but you wouldn't let me; and I was such a fool I couldn't live\nwithout you. But now I see what it is that keeps me back, and what's\nwanted to save me; and I'd compass sea and land to get it\u2014only I'm\nafraid there's no chance.' And he sighed as if his heart would break.\n\"'What is it, Lowborough?' said I, thinking he was fairly cracked at\nlast.\n\"'A wife,' he answered; 'for I can't live alone, because my own mind\ndistracts me, and I can't live with you, because you take the devil's\npart against me.'\n\"'Who\u2014I?'\n\"'Yes\u2014all of you do\u2014and you more than any of them, you know. But if I\ncould get a wife, with fortune enough to pay off my debts and set me\nstraight in the world\u2014'\n\"'To be sure,' said I.\n\"'And sweetness and goodness enough,' he continued, 'to make home\ntolerable, and to reconcile me to myself, I think I should do yet. I\nshall never be in love again, that's certain; but perhaps that would be\nno great matter, it would enable me to choose with my eyes open\u2014and I\nshould make a good husband in spite of it; but could any one be in love\nwith _me?_\u2014that's the question. With _your_ good looks and powers of\nfascination' (he was pleased to say), 'I might hope; but as it is,\nHuntingdon, do you think _any_body would take me\u2014ruined and wretched as\nI am?'\n\"'Yes, certainly.'\n\"'Who?'\n\"'Why, any neglected old maid, fast sinking in despair, would be\ndelighted to\u2014'\n\"'No, no,' said he\u2014'it must be somebody that I can love.'\n\"'Why, you just said you never could be in love again!'\n\"'Well, love is not the word\u2014but somebody that I can like. I'll search\nall England through, at all events!' he cried, with a sudden burst of\nhope, or desperation. 'Succeed or fail, it will be better than rushing\nheadlong to destruction at that d\u2014d club: so farewell to it and you.\nWhenever I meet you on honest ground or under a Christian roof, I shall\nbe glad to see you; but never more shall you entice me to that _devil's\nden!_'\n\"This was shameful language, but I shook hands with him, and we parted.",

I should like to be less of a pet and\nmore of a friend, if I might choose; but I won't complain of that: I am\nonly afraid his affection loses in depth where it gains in ardour. I\nsometimes liken it to a fire of dry twigs and branches compared with\none of solid coal, very bright and hot; but if it should burn itself\nout and leave nothing but ashes behind, what shall I do? But it won't,\nit _shan_'t, I am determined; and surely I have power to keep it alive.\nSo let me dismiss _that_ thought at once. But Arthur is selfish; I am\nconstrained to acknowledge that; and, indeed, the admission gives me\nless pain than might be expected, for, since _I_ love him so much, I\ncan easily forgive him for loving himself: he likes to be pleased, and\nit is my delight to please him; and when I regret this tendency of his,\nit is for his own sake, not for mine.\nThe first instance he gave was on the occasion of our bridal tour. He\nwanted to hurry it over, for all the continental scenes were already\nfamiliar to him: many had lost their interest in his eyes, and others\nhad never had anything to lose. The consequence was, that after a\nflying transit through part of France and part of Italy, I came back\nnearly as ignorant as I went, having made no acquaintance with persons\nand manners, and very little with things, my head swarming with a\nmotley confusion of objects and scenes; some, it is true, leaving a\ndeeper and more pleasing impression than others, but these embittered\nby the recollection that my emotions had not been shared by my\ncompanion, but that, on the contrary, when I had expressed a particular\ninterest in anything that I saw or desired to see, it had been\ndispleasing to him, inasmuch as it proved that I could take delight in\nanything disconnected with himself.\n[Illustration]\nAs for Paris, we only just touched at that, and he would not give me\ntime to see one-tenth of the beauties and interesting objects of Rome.\nHe wanted to get me home, he said, to have me all to himself, and to\nsee me safely installed as the mistress of Grassdale Manor, just as\nsingle-minded, as na\u00efve, and piquante as I was; and as if I had been\nsome frail butterfly, he expressed himself fearful of rubbing the\nsilver off my wings by bringing me into contact with society,\nespecially that of Paris and Rome; and, more-over, he did not scruple\nto tell me that there were ladies in both places that would tear his\neyes out if they happened to meet him with me.\nOf course I was vexed at all this; but still it was less the\ndisappointment to myself that annoyed me, than the disappointment _in\nhim_, and the trouble I was at to frame excuses to my friends for\nhaving seen and observed so little, without imputing one particle of\nblame to my companion. But when we got home\u2014to my new, delightful\nhome\u2014I was so happy and he was so kind that I freely forgave him all;\nand I was beginning to think my lot _too_ happy, and my husband\nactually too good for me, if not too good for this world, when, on the\nsecond Sunday after our arrival, he shocked and horrified me by another",

She should have\nenough to purify and etherealise her soul, but not enough to refine\naway her heart, and raise her above all human sympathies.\"\n\"And am _I_ above all human sympathies?\" said I.\n\"No, darling; but you are making more progress towards that saintly\ncondition than I like; for all these two hours I have been thinking of\nyou and wanting to catch your eye, and you were so absorbed in your\ndevotions that you had not even a glance to spare for me\u2014I declare it\nis enough to make one jealous of one's Maker\u2014which is very wrong, you\nknow; so don't excite such wicked passions again, for my soul's sake.\"\n\"I will give my whole heart and soul to my Maker if I can,\" I answered,\n\"and not one atom more of it to you than He allows. What are _you_,\nsir, that you should set yourself up as a god, and presume to dispute\npossession of my heart with Him to whom I owe all I have and all I am,\nevery blessing I ever did or ever can enjoy\u2014and yourself among the\nrest\u2014if you _are_ a blessing, which I am half inclined to doubt.\"\n\"Don't be so hard upon me, Helen; and don't pinch my arm so: you are\nsqueezing your fingers into the bone.\"\n\"Arthur,\" continued I, relaxing my hold of his arm, \"you don't love me\nhalf as much as I do you; and yet, if you loved me far less than you\ndo, I would not complain, provided you loved your Maker more. I should\n_rejoice_ to see you at any time so deeply absorbed in your devotions\nthat you had not a single thought to spare for me. But, indeed, I\nshould lose nothing by the change, for the more you loved your God the\nmore deep and pure and true would be your love to me.\"\nAt this he only laughed and kissed my hand, calling me a sweet\nenthusiast. Then taking off his hat, he added: \"But look here,\nHelen\u2014what can a man do with such a head as this?\"\nThe head looked right enough, but when he placed my hand on the top of\nit, it sunk in a bed of curls, rather alarmingly low, especially in the\nmiddle.\n\"You see I was not made to be a saint,\" said he, laughing, \"If God\nmeant me to be religious, why didn't He give me a proper organ of\nveneration?\"\n\"You are like the servant,\" I replied, \"who, instead of employing his\none talent in his master's service, restored it to him unimproved,\nalleging, as an excuse, that he knew him 'to be a hard man, reaping\nwhere he had not sown, and gathering where he had not strawed.' Of him\nto whom less is given, less will be required, but our utmost exertions\nare required of us all. You are not without the capacity of veneration,\nand faith and hope, and conscience and reason, and every other\nrequisite to a Christian's character, if you choose to employ them; but\nall our talents increase in the using, and every faculty, both good and\nbad, strengthens by exercise: therefore, if you choose to use the bad,\nor those which tend to evil, till they become your masters, and neglect\nthe good till they dwindle away, you have only yourself to blame. But\nyou _have_ talents, Arthur\u2014natural endowments both of heart and mind\nand temper, such as many a better Christian would be glad to possess,\nif you would only employ them in God's service.

Now, in the first place, I should be loth to wait till\nto-morrow when I have the means of appeasing my hunger already before\nme: in the second place, the solid viands of to-day are more to my\ntaste than the dainties that are promised me; in the third place, I\ndon't _see_ to-morrow's banquet, and how can I tell that it is not all\na fable, got up by the greasy-faced fellow that is advising me to\nabstain in order that he may have all the good victuals to himself? in\nthe fourth place, this table must be spread for somebody, and, as\nSolomon says, 'Who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto more than\nI?' and finally, with your leave, I'll sit down and satisfy my cravings\nof to-day, and leave to-morrow to shift for itself\u2014who knows but what I\nmay secure both this and that?\"\n\"But you are not required to abstain from the substantial dinner of\nto-day: you are only advised to partake of these coarser viands in such\nmoderation as not to incapacitate you from enjoying the choicer banquet\nof to-morrow. If, regardless of that counsel, you choose to make a\nbeast of yourself now, and over-eat and over-drink yourself till you\nturn the good victuals into poison, who is to blame if, hereafter,\nwhile you are suffering the torments of yesterday's gluttony and\ndrunkenness, you see more temperate men sitting down to enjoy\nthemselves at that splendid entertainment which you are unable to\ntaste?\"\n\"Most true, my patron saint; but again, our friend Solomon says, 'There\nis nothing better for a man than to eat and to drink, and to be\nmerry.'\"\n\"And again,\" returned I, \"he says, 'Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth;\nand walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes:\nbut know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into\njudgment.'\"\n\"Well, but, Helen, I'm sure I've been very good these last few weeks.\nWhat have you seen amiss in me, and what would you have me to do?\"\n\"Nothing more than you do, Arthur: your actions are all right so far;\nbut I would have your thoughts changed; I would have you to fortify\nyourself against temptation, and not to call evil good, and good evil;\nI should wish you to think more deeply, to look further, and aim higher\nthan you do.\"",

In fine weather he generally manages to get\nthrough the time pretty well, but on rainy days, of which we have had a\ngood many of late, it is quite painful to witness his ennui. I do all I\ncan to amuse him, but it is impossible to get him to feel interested in\nwhat I most like to talk about, while, on the other hand, he likes to\ntalk about things that cannot interest me\u2014or even that annoy me\u2014and\nthese please him\u2014the most of all: for his favourite amusement is to sit\nor loll beside me on the sofa, and tell me stories of his former\namours, always turning upon the ruin of some confiding girl or the\ncozening of some unsuspecting husband; and when I express my horror and\nindignation, he lays it all to the charge of jealousy, and laughs till\nthe tears run down his cheeks. I used to fly into passions or melt into\ntears at first, but seeing that his delight increased in proportion to\nmy anger and agitation, I have since endeavoured to suppress my\nfeelings and receive his revelations in the silence of calm contempt;\nbut still he reads the inward struggle in my face, and misconstrues my\nbitterness of soul for his unworthiness into the pangs of wounded\njealousy; and when he has sufficiently diverted himself with that, or\nfears my displeasure will become too serious for his comfort, he tries\nto kiss and soothe me into smiles again\u2014never were his caresses so\nlittle welcome as then! This is _double_ selfishness, displayed to me\nand to the victims of his former love. There are times when, with a\nmomentary pang\u2014a flash of wild dismay, I ask myself, \"Helen, what have\nyou done?\" But I rebuke the inward questioner, and repel the obtrusive\nthoughts that crowd upon me; for were he ten times as sensual and\nimpenetrable to good and lofty thoughts, I well know I have no right to\ncomplain. And I don't and won't complain. I do and will love him still;\nand I do not and will not regret that I have linked my fate with his.",

It was\nsome consolation, however, to find that in this instance the lady had\nbeen more to blame than he, for he was very young at the time, and she\nhad decidedly made the first advances, if what he said was true. I\nhated her for it, for it seemed as if she had chiefly contributed to\nhis corruption; and when he was beginning to talk about her the other\nday, I begged he would not mention her, for I detested the very sound\nof her name.\n\"Not because you loved her, Arthur, mind, but because she injured you\nand deceived her husband, and was altogether a very abominable woman,\nwhom you ought to be ashamed to mention.\"\nBut he defended her by saying that she had a doting old husband, whom\nit was impossible to love.\n\"Then why did she marry him?\" said I.\n\"For his money,\" was the reply.\n\"Then that was another crime, and her solemn promise to love and honour\nhim was another, that only increased the enormity of the last.\"\n\"You are too severe upon the poor lady,\" laughed he. \"But never mind,\nHelen, I don't care for her now; and I never loved any of them half as\nmuch as I do you, so you needn't fear to be forsaken like them.\"\n\"If you had told me these things before, Arthur, I never should have\ngiven you the chance.\"\n\"_Wouldn't_ you, my darling?\"\n\"Most certainly not!\"\nHe laughed incredulously.\n\"I wish I could convince you of it now!\" cried I, starting up from\nbeside him: and for the first time in my life, and I hope the last, I\nwished I had not married him.",

This was only an hour after\ndinner: I knew he would find it very dull to sit alone all the evening;\nand this considerably softened my resentment, though it did not make me\nrelent. I was determined to show him that my heart was not his slave,\nand I could live without him if I chose; and I sat down and wrote a\nlong letter to my aunt, of course telling her nothing of all this. Soon\nafter ten o'clock I heard him come up again, but he passed my door and\nwent straight to his own dressing-room, where he shut himself in for\nthe night.\nI was rather anxious to see how he would meet me in the morning, and\nnot a little disappointed to behold him enter the breakfast-room with a\ncareless smile.\n\"Are you cross still, Helen?\" said he, approaching as if to salute me.\nI coldly turned to the table, and began to pour out the coffee,\nobserving that he was rather late.\nHe uttered a low whistle and sauntered away to the window, where he\nstood for some minutes looking out upon the pleasing prospect of sullen\ngrey clouds, streaming rain, soaking lawn, and dripping leafless trees,\nand muttering execrations on the weather, and then sat down to\nbreakfast. While taking his coffee he muttered it was \"d\u2014d cold.\"\n\"You should not have left it so long,\" said I.\nHe made no answer, and the meal was concluded in silence. It was a\nrelief to both when the letter-bag was brought in. It contained upon\nexamination a newspaper and one or two letters for him, and a couple of\nletters for me, which he tossed across the table without a remark. One\nwas from my brother, the other from Milicent Hargrave, who is now in\nLondon with her mother. His, I think, were business letters, and\napparently not much to his mind, for he crushed them into his pocket\nwith some muttered expletives that I should have reproved him for at\nany other time. The paper he set before him, and pretended to be deeply\nabsorbed in its contents during the remainder of breakfast, and a\nconsiderable time after.",

            "text": "The reading and answering of my letters, and the direction of household\nconcerns, afforded me ample employment for the morning: after lunch I\ngot my drawing, and from dinner till bed-time I read. Meanwhile, poor\nArthur was sadly at a loss for something to amuse him or to occupy his\ntime. He wanted to appear as busy and as unconcerned as I did. Had the\nweather at all permitted, he would doubtless have ordered his horse and\nset off to some distant region, no matter where, immediately after\nbreakfast, and not returned till night: had there been a lady anywhere\nwithin reach, of any age between fifteen and forty-five, he would have\nsought revenge and found employment in getting up, or trying to get up,\na desperate flirtation with her; but being, to my private satisfaction,\nentirely cut off from both these sources of diversion, his sufferings\nwere truly deplorable. When he had done yawning over his paper and\nscribbling short answers to his shorter letters, he spent the remainder\nof the morning and the whole of the afternoon in fidgeting about from\nroom to room, watching the clouds, cursing the rain, alternately\npetting and teasing and abusing his dogs, sometimes lounging on the\nsofa with a book that he could not force himself to read, and very\noften fixedly gazing at me when he thought I did not perceive it, with\nthe vain hope of detecting some traces of tears, or some tokens of\nremorseful anguish in my face. But I managed to preserve an undisturbed\nthough grave serenity throughout the day. I was not really angry: I\nfelt for him all the time, and longed to be reconciled; but I\ndetermined he should make the first advances, or at least show some\nsigns of an humble and contrite spirit first; for, if I began, it would\nonly minister to his self-conceit, increase his arrogance, and quite\ndestroy the lesson I wanted to give him.\nHe made a long stay in the dining-room after dinner, and, I fear, took\nan unusual quantity of wine, but not enough to loosen his tongue: for\nwhen he came in and found me quietly occupied with my book, too busy to\nlift my head on his entrance, he merely murmured an expression of\nsuppressed disapprobation, and, shutting the door with a bang, went and\nstretched himself at full length on the sofa, and composed himself to\nsleep. But his favourite cocker, Dash, that had been lying at my feet,\ntook the liberty of jumping upon him and beginning to lick his face. He\nstruck it off with a smart blow, and the poor dog squeaked and ran\ncowering back to me. When he woke up, about half an hour after, he\ncalled it to him again, but Dash only looked sheepish and wagged the\ntip of his tail. He called again more sharply, but Dash only clung the\ncloser to me, and licked my hand, as if imploring protection. Enraged\nat this, his master snatched up a heavy book and hurled it at his head.\nThe poor dog set up a piteous outcry, and ran to the door. I let him\nout, and then quietly took up the book.\n\"Give that book to me,\" said Arthur, in no very courteous tone. I gave\nit to him.\n\"Why did you let the dog out?\" he asked; \"you knew I wanted him.\"\n\"By what token?\" I replied; \"by your throwing the book at him? but\nperhaps it was intended for me?\"\n\"No; but I see you've got a taste of it,\" said he, looking at my hand,\nthat had also been struck, and was rather severely grazed.\nI returned to my reading, and he endeavoured to occupy himself in the\nsame manner; but in a little while, after several portentous yawns, he\npronounced _his_ book to be \"cursed trash,\" and threw it on the table.\nThen followed eight or ten minutes of silence, during the greater part\nof which, I believe, he was staring at me. At last his patience was\ntired out.\n\"What _is_ that book, Helen?\" he exclaimed.\nI told him.\n\"Is it interesting?\"\n\"Yes, very.\"\nI went on reading, or pretending to read, at least\u2014I cannot say there\nwas much communication between my eyes and my brain; for, while the\nformer ran over the pages, the latter was earnestly wondering when\nArthur would speak next, and what he would say, and what I should\nanswer. But he did not speak again till I rose to make the tea, and\nthen it was only to say he should not take any. He continued lounging\non the sofa, and alternately closing his eyes and looking at his watch\nand at me, till bed-time, when I rose, and took my candle and retired.\n\"Helen!\" cried he, the moment I had left the room. I turned back, and\nstood awaiting his commands.\n\"What do you want, Arthur?\" I said at length.\n\"Nothing,\" replied he. \"Go!\"\nI went, but hearing him mutter something as I was closing the door, I\nturned again. It sounded very like \"confounded slut,\" but I was quite\nwilling it should be something else.\n\"Were you speaking, Arthur?\" I asked.\n\"No,\" was the answer, and I shut the door and departed. I saw nothing\nmore of him till the following morning at breakfast, when he came down\na full hour after the usual time.\n\"You're very late,\" was my morning's salutation.\n\"You needn't have waited for me,\" was his; and he walked up to the\nwindow again. It was just such weather as yesterday.\n\"Oh, this confounded rain!\" he muttered. But, after studiously\nregarding it for a minute or two, a bright idea, seemed to strike him,\nfor he suddenly exclaimed, \"But I know what I'll do!\" and then returned\nand took his seat at the table. The letter-bag was already there,\nwaiting to be opened. He unlocked it and examined the contents, but\nsaid nothing about them.\n\"Is there anything for me?\" I asked.\n\"No.\"\nHe opened the newspaper and began to read.\n\"You'd better take your coffee,\" suggested I; \"it will be cold again.\"\n\"You may go,\" said he, \"if you've done; I don't want you.\"\nI rose and withdrew to the next room, wondering if we were to have\nanother such miserable day as yesterday, and wishing intensely for an\nend of these mutually inflicted torments. Shortly after I heard him\nring the bell and give some orders about his wardrobe that sounded as\nif he meditated a long journey. He then sent for the coachman, and I\nheard something about the carriage and the horses, and London, and\nseven o'clock to-morrow morning, that startled and disturbed me not a",

But the question is, How am I to alter his purpose? Well,\nI will wait awhile, and see if he mentions it.\"\nI waited most anxiously, from hour to hour; but not a word was spoken,\non that or any other subject, to me. He whistled and talked to his\ndogs, and wandered from room to room, much the same as on the previous\nday. At last I began to think I must introduce the subject myself, and\nwas pondering how to bring it about, when John unwittingly came to my\nrelief with the following message from the coachman:\n\"Please, sir, Richard says one of the horses has got a very bad cold,\nand he thinks, sir, if you could make it convenient to go the day after\nto-morrow, instead of to-morrow, he could physic it to-day, so as\u2014\"\n\"Confound his impudence!\" interjected the master.\n\"Please, sir, he says it would be a deal better if you could,\"\npersisted John, \"for he hopes there'll be a change in the weather\nshortly, and he says it's not _likely_, when a horse is so bad with a\ncold, and physicked and all\u2014\"\n\"Devil take the horse!\" cried the gentleman. \"Well, tell him I'll think\nabout it,\" he added, after a moment's reflection. He cast a searching\nglance at me, as the servant withdrew, expecting to see some token of\ndeep astonishment and alarm; but, being previously prepared, I\npreserved an aspect of stoical indifference. His countenance fell as he\nmet my steady gaze, and he turned away in very obvious disappointment,\nand walked up to the fire-place, where he stood in an attitude of\nundisguised dejection, leaning against the chimney-piece with his\nforehead sunk upon his arm.\n\"Where do you want to go, Arthur?\" said I.\n\"To London,\" replied he, gravely.\n\"What for?\" I asked.\n\"Because I cannot be happy here.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Because my wife doesn't love me.\"\n\"She would love you with all her heart, if you deserved it.\"\n\"What must I do to deserve it?\"\nThis seemed humble and earnest enough; and I was so much affected,\nbetween sorrow and joy, that I was obliged to pause a few seconds\nbefore I could steady my voice to reply.\n\"If she gives you her heart,\" said I, \"you must take it, thankfully,\nand use it well, and not pull it in pieces, and laugh in her face,\nbecause she cannot snatch it away.\"\nHe now turned round, and stood facing me, with his back to the fire.\n\"Come, then, Helen, are you going to be a good girl?\" said he.\nThis sounded rather too arrogant, and the smile that accompanied it did\nnot please me. I therefore hesitated to reply. Perhaps my former answer\nhad implied too much: he had heard my voice falter, and might have seen\nme brush away a tear.\n\"Are you going to forgive me, Helen?\" he resumed, more humbly.\n\"Are _you_ penitent?\" I replied, stepping up to him and smiling in his\nface.\n\"Heart-broken!\" he answered, with a rueful countenance, yet with a\nmerry smile just lurking within his eyes and about the corners of his\nmouth; but this could not repulse me, and I flew into his arms. He\nfervently embraced me, and though I shed a torrent of tears, I think I\nnever was happier in my life than at that moment.\n\"Then you won't go to London, Arthur?\" I said, when the first transport\nof tears and kisses had subsided.\n\"No, love,\u2014unless you will go with me.\"\n\"I will, gladly,\" I answered, \"if you think the change will amuse you,\nand if you will put off the journey till next week.\"\nHe readily consented, but said there was no need of much preparation,\nas he should not be for staying long, for he did not wish me to be\nLondonized, and to lose my country freshness and originality by too\nmuch intercourse with the ladies of the world. I thought this folly;\nbut I did not wish to contradict him now: I merely said that I was of\nvery domestic habits, as he well knew, and had no particular wish to\nmingle with the world.\nSo we are to go to London on Monday, the day after to-morrow. It is now\nfour days since the termination of our quarrel, and I am sure it has\ndone us both good: it has made me like Arthur a great deal better, and\nmade him behave a great deal better to me. He has never once attempted\nto annoy me since, by the most distant allusion to Lady F\u2014\u2014, or any of\nthose disagreeable reminiscences of his former life. I wish I could\nblot them from my memory, or else get him to regard such matters in the\nsame light as I do. Well! it is something, however, to have made him\nsee that they are not fit subjects for a conjugal jest. He may see\nfurther some time. I will put no limits to my hopes; and, in spite of\nmy aunt's forebodings and my own unspoken fears, I trust we shall be\nhappy yet.",

He playfully abuses me for the gall and vinegar of my latest\neffusion, tells me I can have no conception of the multitudinous\nengagements that keep him away, but avers that, in spite of them all,\nhe will assuredly be with me before the close of next week; though it\nis impossible for a man so circumstanced as he is to fix the precise\nday of his return: meantime he exhorts me to the exercise of patience,\n\"that first of woman's virtues,\" and desires me to remember the saying,\n\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" and comfort myself with the\nassurance that the longer he stays away the better he shall love me\nwhen he returns; and till he does return, he begs I will continue to\nwrite to him constantly, for, though he is sometimes too idle and often\ntoo busy to answer my letters as they come, he likes to receive them\ndaily; and if I fulfil my threat of punishing his seeming neglect by\nceasing to write, he shall be so angry that he will do his utmost to\nforget me. He adds this piece of intelligence respecting poor Milicent\nHargrave:\n\"Your little friend Milicent is likely, before long, to follow your\nexample, and take upon her the yoke of matrimony in conjunction with a\nfriend of mine. Hattersley, you know, has not yet fulfilled his direful\nthreat of throwing his precious person away on the first old maid that\nchose to evince a tenderness for him; but he still preserves a resolute\ndetermination to see himself a married man before the year is out.\n'Only,' said he to me, 'I must have somebody that will let me have my\nown way in everything\u2014not like _your_ wife, Huntingdon: she is a\ncharming creature, but she looks as if she had a will of her own, and\ncould play the vixen upon occasion' (I thought 'you're right there,\nman,' but I didn't say so). 'I must have some good, quiet soul that\nwill let me just do what I like and go where I like, keep at home or\nstay away, without a word of reproach or complaint; for I can't do with\nbeing bothered.' 'Well,' said I, 'I know somebody that will suit you to\na tee, if you don't care for money, and that's Hargrave's sister,\nMilicent.' He desired to be introduced to her forthwith, for he said he\nhad plenty of the needful himself, or should have when his old governor\nchose to quit the stage. So you see, Helen, I have managed pretty well,\nboth for your friend and mine.\"\nPoor Milicent! But I cannot imagine she will ever be led to accept such\na suitor\u2014one so repugnant to all her ideas of a man to be honoured and\nloved.\n5th.\u2014Alas! I was mistaken. I have got a long letter from her this\nmorning, telling me she is already engaged, and expects to be married\nbefore the close of the month.\n\"I hardly know what to say about it,\" she writes, \"or what to think. To\ntell you the truth, Helen, I don't like the thoughts of it at all. If I\n_am_ to be Mr. Hattersley's wife, I must try to love him; and I do try\nwith all my might; but I have made very little progress yet; and the\nworst symptom of the case is, that the further he is from me the better\nI like him: he frightens me with his abrupt manners and strange\nhectoring ways, and I dread the thoughts of marrying him. 'Then why\nhave you accepted him?' you will ask; and I didn't know I had accepted\nhim; but mamma tells me I have, and he seems to think so too. I\ncertainly didn't mean to do so; but I did not like to give him a flat\nrefusal, for fear mamma should be grieved and angry (for I knew she\nwished me to marry him), and I wanted to talk to her first about it: so\nI gave him what _I_ thought was an evasive, half negative answer; but\nshe says it was as good as an acceptance, and he would think me very\ncapricious if I were to attempt to draw back\u2014and indeed I was so\nconfused and frightened at the moment, I can hardly tell what I said.\nAnd next time I saw him, he accosted me in all confidence as his\naffianced bride, and immediately began to settle matters with mamma. I\nhad not courage to contradict them then, and how can I do it now? I\ncannot; they would think me mad. Besides, mamma is so delighted with\nthe idea of the match; she thinks she has managed so well for me; and I\ncannot bear to disappoint her. I do object sometimes, and tell her what\nI feel, but you don't know _how_ she talks. Mr. Hattersley, you know,\nis the son of a rich banker, and as Esther and I have no fortunes, and\nWalter very little, our dear mamma is very anxious to see us all well\nmarried, that is, united to rich partners. It is not _my_ idea of being\nwell married, but she means it all for the best. She says when I am\nsafe off her hands it will be such a relief to her mind; and she\nassures me it will be a good thing for the family as well as for me.\nEven Walter is pleased at the prospect, and when I confessed my\nreluctance to him, he said it was all childish nonsense. Do _you_ think\nit nonsense, Helen? I should not care if I could see any prospect of\nbeing able to love and admire him, but I can't. There is nothing about\nhim to hang one's esteem and affection upon; he is so diametrically\nopposite to what I imagined my husband should be. Do write to me, and\nsay all you can to encourage me. Don't attempt to dissuade me, for my\nfate is fixed: preparations for the important event are already going\non around me; and don't say a word against Mr. Hattersley, for I want\nto think well of him; and though I have spoken against him myself, it\nis for the last time: hereafter, I shall never permit myself to utter a\nword in his dispraise, however he may seem to deserve it; and whoever\nventures to speak slightingly of the man I have promised to love, to\nhonour, and obey, must expect my serious displeasure. After all, I\nthink he is quite as good as Mr. Huntingdon, if not better; and yet you\nlove _him_, and seem to be happy and contented; and perhaps I may\nmanage as well. You must tell me, if you can, that Mr. Hattersley is\nbetter than he seems\u2014that he is upright, honourable, and\nopen-hearted\u2014in fact, a perfect diamond in the rough. He may be all\nthis, but I don't know him. I know only the exterior, and what, I\ntrust, is the worst part of him.\"\nShe concludes with \"Good-by, dear Helen. I am waiting anxiously for\nyour advice\u2014but mind you let it be all on the right side.\"",

All the sweet\nsummer is passing away without one breath of pleasure to me or benefit\nto him.

But\nnow\u2014at evening, when I see the round red sun sink quietly down behind\nthose woody hills, leaving them sleeping in a warm, red, golden haze, I\nonly think another lovely day is lost to him and me; and at morning,\nwhen roused by the flutter and chirp of the sparrows, and the gleeful\ntwitter of the swallows\u2014all intent upon feeding their young, and full\nof life and joy in their own little frames\u2014I open the window to inhale\nthe balmy, soul-reviving air, and look out upon the lovely landscape,\nlaughing in dew and sunshine\u2014I too often shame that glorious scene with\ntears of thankless misery, because _he_ cannot feel its freshening\ninfluence; and when I wander in the ancient woods, and meet the little\nwild flowers smiling in my path, or sit in the shadow of our noble\nash-trees by the water-side, with their branches gently swaying in the\nlight summer breeze that murmurs through their feathery foliage\u2014my ears\nfull of that low music mingled with the dreamy hum of insects, my eyes\nabstractedly gazing on the glassy surface of the little lake before me,\nwith the trees that crowd about its bank, some gracefully bending to\nkiss its waters, some rearing their stately heads high above, but\nstretching their wide arms over its margin, all faithfully mirrored\nfar, far down in its glassy depth\u2014though sometimes the images are\npartially broken by the sport of aquatic insects, and sometimes, for a\nmoment, the whole is shivered into trembling fragments by a transient\nbreeze that sweeps the surface too roughly\u2014still I have no pleasure;\nfor the greater the happiness that nature sets before me, the more I\nlament that _he_ is not here to taste it: the greater the bliss we\nmight enjoy together, the more I feel our present wretchedness apart\n(yes, ours; he must be wretched, though he may not know it); and the",

He likes\nto have me near him: and though he is peevish and testy with his\nservants and his dogs, he is gentle and kind to me. What he would be,\nif I did not so watchfully anticipate his wants, and so carefully\navoid, or immediately desist from doing anything that has a tendency to\nirritate or disturb him, with however little reason, I cannot tell. How\nintensely I wish he were worthy of all this care! Last night, as I sat\nbeside him, with his head in my lap, passing my fingers through his\nbeautiful curls, this thought made my eyes overflow with sorrowful\ntears\u2014as it often does; but this time, a tear fell on his face and made\nhim look up. He smiled, but not insultingly.\n\"Dear Helen!\" he said\u2014\"why do you cry? you know that I love you\" (and\nhe pressed my hand to his feverish lips), \"and what more could you\ndesire?\"\n\"Only, Arthur, that you would love _yourself_ as truly and as\nfaithfully as you are loved by me.\"\n\"That would be hard, indeed!\" he replied, tenderly squeezing my hand.\nAugust 24th.\u2014Arthur is himself again, as lusty and reckless, as light\nof heart and head as ever, and as restless and hard to amuse as a\nspoilt child, and almost as full of mischief too, especially when wet\nweather keeps him within doors. I wish he had something to do, some\nuseful trade, or profession, or employment\u2014anything to occupy his head\nor his hands for a few hours a day, and give him something besides his\nown pleasure to think about. If he would play the country gentleman and\nattend to the farm\u2014but that he knows nothing about, and won't give his\nmind to consider,\u2014or if he would take up with some literary study, or\nlearn to draw or to play\u2014as he is so fond of music, I often try to\npersuade him to learn the piano, but he is far too idle for such an\nundertaking: he has no more idea of exerting himself to overcome\nobstacles than he has of restraining his natural appetites; and these\ntwo things are the ruin of him. I lay them both to the charge of his\nharsh yet careless father, and his madly indulgent mother.\u2014If ever I am\na mother I will zealously strive against this _crime_ of\nover-indulgence. I can hardly give it a milder name when I think of the\nevils it brings.\nHappily, it will soon be the shooting season, and then, if the weather\npermit, he will find occupation enough in the pursuit and destruction\nof the partridges and pheasants: we have no grouse, or he might have\nbeen similarly occupied at this moment, instead of lying under the\nacacia-tree pulling poor Dash's ears. But he says it is dull work\nshooting alone; he must have a friend or two to help him.\n\"Let them be tolerably decent then, Arthur,\" said I. The word \"friend\"\nin his mouth makes me shudder: I know it was some of his \"friends\" that\ninduced him to stay behind me in London, and kept him away so long:\nindeed, from what he has unguardedly told me, or hinted from time to\ntime, I cannot doubt that he frequently showed them my letters, to let\nthem see how fondly his wife watched over his interests, and how keenly\nshe regretted his absence; and that they induced him to remain week\nafter week, and to plunge into all manner of excesses, to avoid being\nlaughed at for a wife-ridden fool, and, perhaps, to show how far he\ncould venture to go without danger of shaking the fond creature's\ndevoted attachment. It is a hateful idea, but I cannot believe it is a\nfalse one.\n\"Well,\" replied he, \"I thought of Lord Lowborough for one; but there is\nno possibility of getting him without his better half, our mutual\nfriend, Annabella; so we must ask them both. You're not afraid of her,\nare you, Helen?\" he asked, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.\n\"Of course not,\" I answered: \"why should I? And who besides?\"\n\"Hargrave for one. He will be glad to come, though his own place is so\nnear, for he has little enough land of his own to shoot over, and we\ncan extend our depredations into it, if we like; and he is thoroughly\nrespectable, you know, Helen\u2014quite a lady's man: and I think, Grimsby\nfor another: he's a decent, quiet fellow enough. You'll not object to\nGrimsby?\"\n\"I hate him: but, however, if you wish it, I'll try to endure his\npresence for a while.\"\n\"All a prejudice, Helen, a mere woman's antipathy.\"\n\"No; I have solid grounds for my dislike. And is that all?\"\n\"Why, yes, I think so. Hattersley will be too busy billing and cooing,\nwith his bride to have much time to spare for guns and dogs at\npresent,\" he replied. And that reminds me, that I have had several\nletters from Milicent since her marriage, and that she either is, or\npretends to be, quite reconciled to her lot. She professes to have\ndiscovered numberless virtues and perfections in her husband, some of\nwhich, I fear, less partial eyes would fail to distinguish, though they\nsought them carefully with tears; and now that she is accustomed to his\nloud voice, and abrupt, uncourteous manners, she affirms she finds no\ndifficulty in loving him as a wife should do, and begs I will burn that\nletter wherein she spoke so unadvisedly against him. So that I trust\nshe may yet be happy; but, if she is, it will be entirely the reward of\nher own goodness of heart; for had she chosen to consider herself the\nvictim of fate, or of her mother's worldly wisdom, she might have been\nthoroughly miserable; and if, for duty's sake, she had not made every\neffort to love her husband, she would, doubtless, have hated him to the\nend of her days.",

            "text": "28th.\u2014Yesterday, we all went to the Grove, Mr. Hargrave's\nmuch-neglected home. His mother frequently asks us over, that she may\nhave the pleasure of her dear Walter's company; and this time she had\ninvited us to a dinner-party, and got together as many of the country\ngentry as were within reach to meet us. The entertainment was very well\ngot up; but I could not help thinking about the cost of it all the\ntime. I don't like Mrs. Hargrave; she is a hard, pretentious,\nworldly-minded woman. She has money enough to live very comfortably, if\nshe only knew how to use it judiciously, and had taught her son to do\nthe same; but she is ever straining to keep up appearances, with that\ndespicable pride that shuns the semblance of poverty as of a shameful\ncrime. She grinds her dependents, pinches her servants, and deprives\neven her daughters and herself of the real comforts of life, because\nshe will not consent to yield the palm in outward show to those who\nhave three times her wealth; and, above all, because she is determined\nher cherished son shall be enabled to \"hold up his head with the\nhighest gentlemen in the land.\" This same son, I imagine, is a man of\nexpensive habits, no reckless spendthrift and no abandoned sensualist,\nbut one who likes to have \"everything handsome about him,\" and to go to\na certain length in youthful indulgences, not so much to gratify his\nown tastes as to maintain his reputation as a man of fashion in the\nworld, and a respectable fellow among his own lawless companions; while\nhe is too selfish to consider how many comforts might be obtained for\nhis fond mother and sisters with the money he thus wastes upon himself:\nas long as they can contrive to make a respectable appearance once a\nyear, when they come to town, he gives himself little concern about\ntheir private stintings and struggles at home. This is a harsh judgment\nto form of \"dear, noble-minded, generous-hearted Walter,\" but I fear it\nis too just.\nMrs. Hargrave's anxiety to make good matches for her daughters is\npartly the cause, and partly the result, of these errors: by making a\nfigure in the world, and showing them off to advantage, she hopes to\nobtain better chances for them; and by thus living beyond her\nlegitimate means, and lavishing so much on their brother, she renders\nthem portionless, and makes them burdens on her hands. Poor Milicent, I\nfear, has already fallen a sacrifice to the man\u0153uvrings of this\nmistaken mother, who congratulates herself on having so satisfactorily\ndischarged her maternal duty, and hopes to do as well for Esther. But\nEsther is a child as yet, a little merry romp of fourteen: as\nhonest-hearted, and as guileless and simple as her sister, but with a\nfearless spirit of her own, that I fancy her mother will find some\ndifficulty in bending to her purposes.",

Feel my hand.\"\nAnd I gravely extended it towards him\u2014but closed it upon his with an\nenergy that seemed to disprove the assertion, and made him smile. \"You\nneedn't smile, sir,\" said I, still tightening my grasp, and looking\nsteadfastly on him till he almost quailed before me. \"You may think it\nall very fine, Mr. Huntingdon, to amuse yourself with rousing my\njealousy; but take care you don't rouse my hate instead. And when you\nhave once extinguished my love, you will find it no easy matter to\nkindle it again.\"\n\"Well, Helen, I won't repeat the offence. But I meant nothing by it, I\nassure you. I had taken too much wine, and I was scarcely myself at the\ntime.\"\n\"You often take too much; and that is another practice I detest.\" He\nlooked up astonished at my warmth. \"Yes,\" I continued; \"I never\nmentioned it before, because I was ashamed to do so; but now I'll tell\nyou that it distresses me, and may disgust me, if you go on and suffer\nthe habit to grow upon you, as it will if you don't check it in time.\nBut the whole system of your conduct to Lady Lowborough is not\nreferable to wine; and this night you knew perfectly well what you were\ndoing.\"\n\"Well, I'm sorry for it,\" replied he, with more of sulkiness than\ncontrition: \"what more would you have?\"\n\"You are sorry that I saw you, no doubt,\" I answered coldly.\n\"If you had not seen me,\" he muttered, fixing his eyes on the carpet,\n\"it would have done no harm.\"\nMy heart felt ready to burst; but I resolutely swallowed back my\nemotion, and answered calmly,\n\"You think not?\"\n\"No,\" replied he, boldly. \"After all, what have I done? It's\nnothing\u2014except as you choose to make it a subject of accusation and\ndistress.\"\n\"What would Lord Lowborough, your _friend_, think, if he knew all? or\nwhat would you yourself think, if he or any other had acted the same\npart to me, throughout, as you have to Annabella?\"\n\"I would blow his brains out.\"\n\"Well, then, Arthur, how can you call it nothing\u2014an offence for which\nyou would think yourself justified in blowing another man's brains out?\nIs it nothing to trifle with your friend's feelings and mine\u2014to\nendeavour to steal a woman's affections from her husband\u2014what he values\nmore than his gold, and therefore what it is more dishonest to take?\nAre the marriage vows a jest; and is it nothing to make it your sport\nto break them, and to tempt another to do the same? Can I love a man\nthat does such things, and coolly maintains it is nothing?\"\n\"You are breaking your marriage vows yourself,\" said he, indignantly\nrising and pacing to and fro. \"You promised to honour and obey me, and\nnow you attempt to hector over me, and threaten and accuse me, and call\nme worse than a highwayman. If it were not for your situation, Helen, I\nwould not submit to it so tamely. I won't be dictated to by a woman,\nthough she be my wife.\"\n\"What will you do then? Will you go on till I hate you, and then accuse\nme of breaking my vows?\"\nHe was silent a moment, and then replied: \"You never will hate me.\"\nReturning and resuming his former position at my feet, he repeated more\nvehemently\u2014\"You cannot hate me as long as I love you.\"\n\"But how can I believe that you love me, if you continue to act in this\nway? Just imagine yourself in my place: would _you_ think I loved\n_you_, if _I_ did so? Would you believe my protestations, and honour\nand trust me under such circumstances?\"\n\"The cases are different,\" he replied. \"It is a woman's nature to be\nconstant\u2014to love one and one only, blindly, tenderly, and for\never\u2014bless them, dear creatures! and you above them all; but you must\nhave some commiseration for us, Helen; you must give us a little more\nlicence, for, as Shakespeare has it\u2014\nHowever we do praise ourselves,\nOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\nMore longing, wavering, sooner lost and won\nThan women's are.\"\n\"Do you mean by that, that your fancies are lost to me, and won by Lady\nLowborough?\"\n\"No! heaven is my witness that I think her mere dust and ashes in\ncomparison with you, and shall continue to think so, unless you drive\nme from you by too much severity. She is a daughter of earth; you are\nan angel of heaven; only be not too austere in your divinity, and\nremember that I am a poor, fallible mortal. Come now, Helen; won't you\nforgive me?\" he said, gently taking my hand, and looking up with an\ninnocent smile.\n\"If I do, you will repeat the offence.\"\n\"I swear by\u2014\"\n\"Don't swear; I'll believe your word as well as your oath. I wish I\ncould have confidence in either.\"\n\"Try me, then, Helen: only trust and pardon me this once, and you shall\nsee! Come, I am in hell's torments till you speak the word.\"\nI did not speak it, but I put my hand on his shoulder and kissed his\nforehead, and then burst into tears. He embraced me tenderly; and we\nhave been good friends ever since. He has been decently temperate at\ntable, and well-conducted towards Lady Lowborough. The first day he\nheld himself aloof from her, as far as he could without any flagrant\nbreach of hospitality: since that he has been friendly and civil, but\nnothing more\u2014in my presence, at least, nor, I think, at any other time;\nfor she seems haughty and displeased, and Lord Lowborough is manifestly\nmore cheerful, and more cordial towards his host than before. But I\nshall be glad when they are gone, for I have so little love for\nAnnabella that it is quite a task to be civil to her, and as she is the\nonly woman here besides myself, we are necessarily thrown so much\ntogether. Next time Mrs. Hargrave calls I shall hail her advent as\nquite a relief. I have a good mind to ask Arthur's leave to invite the\nold lady to stay with us till our guests depart. I think I will. She\nwill take it as a kind attention, and, though I have little relish for\nher society, she will be truly welcome as a third to stand between Lady\nLowborough and me.",

We\nsat silent for two or three minutes. She was busy with her work, and I\nwas running over the columns of a paper from which I had extracted all\nthe pith some twenty minutes before. It was a moment of painful\nembarrassment to me, and I thought it must be infinitely more so to\nher; but it seems I was mistaken. She was the first to speak; and,\nsmiling with the coolest assurance, she began,\u2014\n\"Your husband was merry last night, Helen: is he often so?\"\nMy blood boiled in my face; but it was better she should seem to\nattribute his conduct to this than to anything else.\n\"No,\" replied I, \"and never will be so again, I trust.\"\n\"You gave him a curtain lecture, did you?\"\n\"No! but I told him I disliked such conduct, and he promised me not to\nrepeat it.\"\n\"I _thought_ he looked rather subdued this morning,\" she continued;\n\"and you, Helen? you've been weeping, I see\u2014that's our grand resource,\nyou know. But doesn't it make your eyes smart? and do you always find\nit to answer?\"\n\"I never cry for effect; nor can I conceive how any one can.\"\n\"Well, I don't know: I never had occasion to try it; but I think if\nLowborough were to commit such improprieties, I'd make _him_ cry. I\ndon't wonder at your being angry, for I'm sure I'd give my husband a\nlesson he would not soon forget for a lighter offence than that. But\nthen he never _will_ do anything of the kind; for I keep him in too\ngood order for that.\"\n\"Are you sure you don't arrogate too much of the credit to yourself.\nLord Lowborough was quite as remarkable for his abstemiousness for some\ntime before you married him, as he is now, I have heard.\"\n\"Oh, about the _wine_ you mean\u2014yes, he's safe enough for that. And as\nto looking askance to another woman, he's safe enough for that too,\nwhile I live, for he worships the very ground I tread on.\"\n\"Indeed! and are you sure you deserve it?\"\n\"Why, as to that, I can't say: you know we're all fallible creatures,\nHelen; we none of us deserve to be worshipped. But are _you_ sure your\ndarling Huntingdon deserves all the love you give to _him?_\"\nI knew not what to answer to this. I was burning with anger; but I\nsuppressed all outward manifestations of it, and only bit my lip and\npretended to arrange my work.\n\"At any rate,\" resumed she, pursuing her advantage, \"you can console\nyourself with the assurance that _you_ are worthy of all the love he\ngives to you.\"\n\"You flatter me,\" said I; \"but, at least, I can try to be worthy of\nit.\" And then I turned the conversation.",

God has sent me a soul to educate for heaven, and give me a\nnew and calmer bliss, and stronger hopes to comfort me.\nDec. 25th, 1823.\u2014Another year is gone. My little Arthur lives and\nthrives. He is healthy, but not robust, full of gentle playfulness and\nvivacity, already affectionate, and susceptible of passions and\nemotions it will be long ere he can find words to express. He has won\nhis father's heart at last; and now my constant terror is, lest he\nshould be ruined by that father's thoughtless indulgence. But I must\nbeware of my own weakness too, for I never knew till now how strong are\na parent's temptations to spoil an only child.\nI have need of consolation in my son, for (to this silent paper I may\nconfess it) I have but little in my husband. I love him still; and he\nloves me, in his own way\u2014but oh, how different from the love I could\nhave given, and once had hoped to receive! How little real sympathy\nthere exists between us; how many of my thoughts and feelings are\ngloomily cloistered within my own mind; how much of my higher and\nbetter self is indeed unmarried\u2014doomed either to harden and sour in the\nsunless shade of solitude, or to quite degenerate and fall away for\nlack of nutriment in this unwholesome soil! But, I repeat, I have no\nright to complain; only let me state the truth\u2014some of the truth, at\nleast,\u2014and see hereafter if any darker truths will blot these pages. We\nhave now been full two years united; the \"romance\" of our attachment\nmust be worn away. Surely I have now got down to the lowest gradation\nin Arthur's affection, and discovered all the evils of his nature: if\nthere be any further change, it must be for the better, as we become\nstill more accustomed to each other; surely we shall find no lower\ndepth than this.

And yet,\nthrough all, I was not wholly comfortless: I had my darling, sinless,\ninoffensive little one to console me; but even this consolation was\nembittered by the constantly-recurring thought, \"How shall I teach him\nhereafter to respect his father, and yet to avoid his example?\"\nBut I remembered that I had brought all these afflictions, in a manner\nwilfully, upon myself; and I determined to bear them without a murmur.\nAt the same time I resolved not to give myself up to misery for the\ntransgressions of another, and endeavoured to divert myself as much as\nI could; and besides the companionship of my child, and my dear,\nfaithful Rachel, who evidently guessed my sorrows and felt for them,\nthough she was too discreet to allude to them, I had my books and\npencil, my domestic affairs, and the welfare and comfort of Arthur's\npoor tenants and labourers to attend to: and I sometimes sought and\nobtained amusement in the company of my young friend Esther Hargrave:\noccasionally I rode over to see her, and once or twice I had her to\nspend the day with me at the Manor. Mrs. Hargrave did not visit London\nthat season: having no daughter to marry, she thought it as well to\nstay at home and economise; and, for a wonder, Walter came down to join\nher in the beginning of June, and stayed till near the close of August.\nThe first time I saw him was on a sweet, warm evening, when I was\nsauntering in the park with little Arthur and Rachel, who is head-nurse\nand lady's-maid in one\u2014for, with my secluded life and tolerably active\nhabits, I require but little attendance, and as she had nursed me and\ncoveted to nurse my child, and was moreover so very trustworthy, I\npreferred committing the important charge to her, with a young\nnursery-maid under her directions, to engaging any one else: besides,\nit saves money; and since I have made acquaintance with Arthur's\naffairs, I have learnt to regard that as no trifling recommendation;\nfor, by my own desire, nearly the whole of the income of my fortune is\ndevoted, for years to come, to the paying off of his debts, and the\nmoney he contrives to squander away in London is incomprehensible. But\nto return to Mr. Hargrave. I was standing with Rachel beside the water,\namusing the laughing baby in her arms with a twig of willow laden with\ngolden catkins, when, greatly to my surprise, he entered the park,\nmounted on his costly black hunter, and crossed over the grass to meet\nme. He saluted me with a very fine compliment, delicately worded, and\nmodestly delivered withal, which he had doubtless concocted as he rode\nalong. He told me he had brought a message from his mother, who, as he\nwas riding that way, had desired him to call at the Manor and beg the\npleasure of my company to a friendly family dinner to-morrow.\n\"There is no one to meet but ourselves,\" said he; \"but Esther is very\nanxious to see you; and my mother fears you will feel solitary in this\ngreat house so much alone, and wishes she could persuade you to give\nher the pleasure of your company more frequently, and make yourself at\nhome in our more humble dwelling, till Mr. Huntingdon's return shall\nrender this a little more conducive to your comfort.\"\n\"She is very kind,\" I answered, \"but I am not alone, you see;\u2014and those\nwhose time is fully occupied seldom complain of solitude.\"\n\"Will you not come to-morrow, then? She will be sadly disappointed if\nyou refuse.\"\nI did not relish being thus compassionated for my loneliness; but,\nhowever, I promised to come.\n\"What a sweet evening this is!\" observed he, looking round upon the\nsunny park, with its imposing swell and slope, its placid water, and\nmajestic clumps of trees. \"And what a paradise you live in!\"\n\"It is a lovely evening,\" answered I; and I sighed to think how little\nI had felt its loveliness, and how little of a paradise sweet Grassdale\nwas to me\u2014how still less to the voluntary exile from its scenes.",

Where I\nhave but sipped and tasted, he drains the cup to the dregs; and if ever\nfor a moment I have sought to drown the voice of reflection in madness\nand folly, or if I have wasted too much of my time and talents among\nreckless and dissipated companions, God knows I would gladly renounce\nthem entirely and for ever, if I had but _half_ the blessings that man\nso thanklessly casts behind his back\u2014but _half_ the inducements to\nvirtue and domestic, orderly habits that he despises\u2014but _such_ a home,\nand _such_ a partner to share it!

How vigorous my little godson\ngrows! and how merry he is this morning!\" He approached the child, and\nstooped to take his hand; but, on seeing that his caresses were likely\nto produce tears and lamentations, instead of a reciprocation of\nfriendly demonstrations, he prudently drew back.\n\"What a pleasure and comfort that little creature must be to you, Mrs.\nHuntingdon!\" he observed, with a touch of sadness in his intonation, as\nhe admiringly contemplated the infant.\n\"It is,\" replied I; and then I asked after his mother and sister.\nHe politely answered my inquiries, and then returned again to the\nsubject I wished to avoid; though with a degree of timidity that\nwitnessed his fear to offend.\n\"You have not heard from Huntingdon lately?\" he said.\n\"Not this week,\" I replied. Not these three weeks, I might have said.\n\"I had a letter from him this morning. I wish it were such a one as I\ncould show to his lady.\" He half drew from his waistcoat-pocket a\nletter with Arthur's still beloved hand on the address, scowled at it,\nand put it back again, adding\u2014\"But he tells me he is about to return\nnext week.\"\n\"He tells _me_ so every time he writes.\"\n\"Indeed! well, it is like him. But to me he always avowed it his\nintention to stay till the present month.\"\nIt struck me like a blow, this proof of premeditated transgression and\nsystematic disregard of truth.\n\"It is only of a piece with the rest of his conduct,\" observed Mr.\nHargrave, thoughtfully regarding me, and reading, I suppose, my\nfeelings in my face.\n\"Then he is really coming next week?\" said I, after a pause.\n\"You may rely upon it, if the assurance can give you any pleasure. And\nis it _possible_, Mrs. Huntingdon, that you can rejoice at his return?\"\nhe exclaimed, attentively perusing my features again.\n\"Of course, Mr. Hargrave; is he not my husband?\"\n\"Oh, Huntingdon; you know not _what_ you slight!\" he passionately\nmurmured.\nI took up my baby, and, wishing him good-morning, departed, to indulge\nmy thoughts unscrutinized, within the sanctum of my home.\nAnd _was_ I glad? Yes, delighted; though I was angered by Arthur's\nconduct, and though I felt that he had wronged me, and was determined\nhe should feel it too.",

You told me that you could, and would too; and you\npromised\u2014\"\n\"Come, come, Helen, don't begin with that nonsense now; I can't bear\nit.\"\n\"Can't bear what?\u2014to be reminded of the promises you have broken?\"\n\"Helen, you are cruel. If you knew how my heart throbbed, and how every\nnerve thrilled through me while you spoke, you would spare me. You can\npity a dolt of a servant for breaking a dish; but you have no\ncompassion for _me_ when my head is split in two and all on fire with\nthis consuming fever.\"\nHe leant his head on his hand, and sighed. I went to him and put my\nhand on his forehead. It was burning indeed.\n\"Then come with me into the drawing-room, Arthur; and don't take any\nmore wine: you have taken several glasses since dinner, and eaten next\nto nothing all the day. How can _that_ make you better?\"\nWith some coaxing and persuasion, I got him to leave the table. When\nthe baby was brought I tried to amuse him with that; but poor little\nArthur was cutting his teeth, and his father could not bear his\ncomplaints: sentence of immediate banishment was passed upon him on the\nfirst indication of fretfulness; and because, in the course of the\nevening, I went to share his exile for a little while, I was\nreproached, on my return, for preferring my child to my husband. I\nfound the latter reclining on the sofa just as I had left him.\n\"Well!\" exclaimed the injured man, in a tone of pseudo-resignation. \"I\nthought I wouldn't send for you; I thought I'd just see how long it\nwould please you to leave me alone.\"\n\"I have not been very long, have I, Arthur? I have not been an hour,\nI'm sure.\"\n\"Oh, of course, an hour is nothing to you, so pleasantly employed; but\nto _me_\u2014\"\n\"It has not been pleasantly employed,\" interrupted I. \"I have been\nnursing our poor little baby, who is very far from well, and I could\nnot leave him till I got him to sleep.\"\n\"Oh, to be sure, you're overflowing with kindness and pity for\neverything but me.\"\n\"And why should I pity _you?_ What is the matter with you?\"\n\"Well! that passes everything! After all the wear and tear that I've\nhad, when I come home sick and weary, longing for comfort, and\nexpecting to find attention and kindness, at least from my wife, she\ncalmly asks what is the matter with me!\"\n\"There is _nothing_ the matter with you,\" returned I, \"except what you\nhave wilfully brought upon yourself, against my earnest exhortation and\nentreaty.\"\n\"Now, Helen,\" said he emphatically, half rising from his recumbent\nposture, \"if you bother me with another word, I'll ring the bell and\norder six bottles of wine, and, by heaven, I'll drink them dry before I\nstir from this place!\"\nI said no more, but sat down before the table and drew a book towards\nme.\n\"Do let me have quietness at least!\" continued he, \"if you deny me\nevery other comfort;\" and sinking back into his former position, with\nan impatient expiration between a sigh and a groan, he languidly closed\nhis eyes, as if to sleep.\nWhat the book was that lay open on the table before me, I cannot tell,\nfor I never looked at it. With an elbow on each side of it, and my\nhands clasped before my eyes, I delivered myself up to silent weeping.\nBut Arthur was not asleep: at the first slight sob, he raised his head\nand looked round, impatiently exclaiming, \"What are you crying for,\nHelen? What the deuce is the matter _now?_\"\n\"I'm crying for you, Arthur,\" I replied, speedily drying my tears; and\nstarting up, I threw myself on my knees before him, and clasping his\nnerveless hand between my own, continued: \"Don't you know that you are\na part of myself? And do you think you can injure and degrade yourself,\nand I not feel it?\"\n\"_Degrade_ myself, Helen?\"\n\"Yes, degrade! What have you been doing all this time?\"\n\"You'd better not ask,\" said he, with a faint smile.\n\"And you had better not tell; but you cannot deny that you _have_\ndegraded yourself miserably. You have shamefully wronged yourself, body\nand soul, and me too; and I can't endure it quietly, and I won't!\"\n\"Well, don't squeeze my hand so frantically, and don't agitate me so,\nfor heaven's sake! Oh, Hattersley! you were right: this woman will be\nthe death of me, with her keen feelings and her interesting force of\ncharacter. There, there, do spare me a little.\"\n\"Arthur, you _must_ repent!\" cried I, in a frenzy of desperation,\nthrowing my arms around him and burying my face in his bosom. \"You\n_shall_ say you are sorry for what you have done!\"\n\"Well, well, I am.\"\n\"You are not! you'll do it again.\"\n\"I shall never live to do it again if you treat me so savagely,\"\nreplied he, pushing me from him. \"You've nearly squeezed the breath out\nof my body.\" He pressed his hand to his heart, and looked really\nagitated and ill.\n\"Now get me a glass of wine,\" said he, \"to remedy what you've done, you\nshe tiger!

I've lived more in these four months,\nHelen, than you have in the whole course of your existence, or will to\nthe end of your days, if they numbered a hundred years; so I must\nexpect to pay for it in some shape.\"\n\"You will have to pay a higher price than you anticipate, if you don't\ntake care: there will be the total loss of your own health, and of my\naffection too, if _that_ is of any value to you.\"\n\"What! you're at that game of threatening me with the loss of your\naffection again, are you? I think it couldn't have been very genuine\nstuff to begin with, if it's so easily demolished. If you don't mind,\nmy pretty tyrant, you'll make me regret my choice in good earnest, and\nenvy my friend Hattersley his meek little wife: she's quite a pattern\nto her sex, Helen. He had her with him in London all the season, and\nshe was no trouble at all. He might amuse himself just as he pleased,\nin regular bachelor style, and she never complained of neglect; he\nmight come home at any hour of the night or morning, or not come home\nat all; be sullen, sober, or glorious drunk; and play the fool or the\nmadman to his own heart's desire, without any fear or botheration. She\nnever gives him a word of reproach or complaint, do what he will. He\nsays there's not such a jewel in all England, and swears he wouldn't\ntake a kingdom for her.\"\n\"But he makes her life a curse to her.\"\n\"Not he! She has no will but his, and is always contented and happy as\nlong as he is enjoying himself.\"\n\"In that case she is as great a fool as he is; but it is not so. I have\nseveral letters from her, expressing the greatest anxiety about his\nproceedings, and complaining that you incite him to commit those\nextravagances\u2014one especially, in which she implores me to use my\ninfluence with you to get you away from London, and affirms that her\nhusband never did such things before you came, and would certainly\ndiscontinue them as soon as you departed and left him to the guidance\nof his own good sense.\"\n\"The detestable little traitor! Give me the letter, and he shall see it\nas sure as I'm a living man.\"\n\"No, he shall not see it without her consent; but if he did, there is\nnothing there to anger him, nor in any of the others. She never speaks\na word against him: it is only anxiety _for_ him that she expresses.\nShe only alludes to his conduct in the most delicate terms, and makes\nevery excuse for him that she can possibly think of; and as for her own\nmisery, I rather _feel_ it than _see_ it expressed in her letters.\"\n\"But she abuses _me;_ and no doubt you helped her.\"\n\"No; I told her she over-rated my influence with you, that I would\ngladly draw you away from the temptations of the town if I could, but\nhad little hope of success, and that I thought she was wrong in\nsupposing that you enticed Mr. Hattersley or any one else into error. I\nhad myself held the _contrary_ opinion at one time, but I now believed\nthat you mutually corrupted each other; and, perhaps, if she used a\nlittle gentle but serious remonstrance with her husband, it might be of\nsome service; as, though he was more rough-hewn than mine, I believed\nhe was of a less impenetrable material.\"\n\"And so _that_ is the way you go on\u2014heartening each other up to mutiny,\nand abusing each other's partners, and throwing out implications\nagainst your own, to the mutual gratification of both!\"\n\"According to your own account,\" said I, \"my evil counsel has had but\nlittle effect upon _her_. And as to abuse and aspersions, we are both\nof us far too deeply ashamed of the errors and vices of our other\nhalves, to make them the common subject of our correspondence. Friends\nas we are, we would willingly keep your failings to ourselves\u2014even\n_from_ ourselves if we could, unless by knowing them we could deliver\nyou from them.\"\n\"Well, well! don't worry me about them: you'll never effect any good by\nthat. Have patience with me, and bear with my languor and crossness a\nlittle while, till I get this cursed low fever out of my veins, and\nthen you'll find me cheerful and kind as ever. Why can't you be gentle\nand good, as you were last time?\u2014I'm sure I was very grateful for it.\"\n\"And what good did your gratitude do? I deluded myself with the idea\nthat you were ashamed of your transgressions, and hoped you would never\nrepeat them again; but now you have left me nothing to hope!\"\n\"My case is quite desperate, is it? A very blessed consideration, if it\nwill only secure me from the pain and worry of my dear anxious wife's\nefforts to convert me, and her from the toil and trouble of such\nexertions, and her sweet face and silver accents from the ruinous\neffects of the same. A burst of passion is a fine rousing thing upon\noccasion, Helen, and a flood of tears is marvellously affecting, but,\nwhen indulged too often, they are both deuced plaguy things for\nspoiling one's beauty and tiring out one's friends.\"\nThenceforth I restrained my tears and passions as much as I could. I\nspared him my exhortations and fruitless efforts at conversion too, for\nI saw it was all in vain: God might awaken that heart, supine and\nstupefied with self-indulgence, and remove the film of sensual darkness\nfrom his eyes, but I could not. His injustice and ill-humour towards\nhis inferiors, who could not defend themselves, I still resented and\nwithstood; but when I alone was their object, as was frequently the\ncase, I endured it with calm forbearance, except at times, when my\ntemper, worn out by repeated annoyances, or stung to distraction by\nsome new instance of irrationality, gave way in spite of myself, and\nexposed me to the imputations of fierceness, cruelty, and impatience. I\nattended carefully to his wants and amusements, but not, I own, with\nthe same devoted fondness as before, because I could not feel it;\nbesides, I had now another claimant on my time and care\u2014my ailing\ninfant, for whose sake I frequently braved and suffered the reproaches\nand complaints of his unreasonably exacting father.\nBut Arthur is not naturally a peevish or irritable man; so far from it,\nthat there was something almost ludicrous in the incongruity of this\nadventitious fretfulness and nervous irritability, rather calculated to\nexcite laughter than anger, if it were not for the intensely painful\nconsiderations attendant upon those symptoms of a disordered frame, and\nhis temper gradually improved as his bodily health was restored, which\nwas much sooner than would have been the case but for my strenuous\nexertions; for there was still one thing about him that I did not give\nup in despair, and one effort for his preservation that I would not\nremit. His appetite for the stimulus of wine had increased upon him, as\nI had too well foreseen. It was now something more to him than an\naccessory to social enjoyment: it was an important source of enjoyment\nin itself. In this time of weakness and depression he would have made\nit his medicine and support, his comforter, his recreation, and his\nfriend, and thereby sunk deeper and deeper, and bound himself down for\never in the bathos whereinto he had fallen. But I determined this\nshould never be, as long as I had any influence left; and though I\ncould not prevent him from taking more than was good for him, still, by\nincessant perseverance, by kindness, and firmness, and vigilance, by\ncoaxing, and daring, and determination, I succeeded in preserving him\nfrom absolute bondage to that detestable propensity, so insidious in\nits advances, so inexorable in its tyranny, so disastrous in its\neffects.",

            "text": "And here I must not forget that I am not a little indebted to his\nfriend Mr. Hargrave. About that time he frequently called at Grassdale,\nand often dined with us, on which occasions I fear Arthur would\nwillingly have cast prudence and decorum to the winds, and made \"a\nnight of it,\" as often as his friend would have consented to join him\nin that exalted pastime; and if the latter had chosen to comply, he\nmight, in a night or two, have ruined the labour of weeks, and\noverthrown with a touch the frail bulwark it had cost me such trouble\nand toil to construct. I was so fearful of this at first, that I\nhumbled myself to intimate to him, in private, my apprehensions of\nArthur's proneness to these excesses, and to express a hope that he\nwould not encourage it. He was pleased with this mark of confidence,\nand certainly did not betray it. On that and every subsequent occasion\nhis presence served rather as a check upon his host, than an incitement\nto further acts of intemperance; and he always succeeded in bringing\nhim from the dining-room in good time, and in tolerably good condition;\nfor if Arthur disregarded such intimations as \"Well, I must not detain\nyou from your lady,\" or \"We must not forget that Mrs. Huntingdon is\nalone,\" he would insist upon leaving the table himself, to join me, and\nhis host, however unwillingly, was obliged to follow.\nHence I learned to welcome Mr. Hargrave as a real friend to the family,\na harmless companion for Arthur, to cheer his spirits and preserve him\nfrom the tedium of absolute idleness and a total isolation from all\nsociety but mine, and a useful ally to me. I could not but feel\ngrateful to him under such circumstances; and I did not scruple to\nacknowledge my obligation on the first convenient opportunity; yet, as\nI did so, my heart whispered all was not right, and brought a glow to\nmy face, which he heightened by his steady, serious gaze, while, by his\nmanner of receiving those acknowledgments, he more than doubled my\nmisgivings. His high delight at being able to serve me was chastened by\nsympathy for me and commiseration for himself\u2014about, I know not what,\nfor I would not stay to inquire, or suffer him to unburden his sorrows\nto me. His sighs and intimations of suppressed affliction seemed to\ncome from a full heart; but either he must contrive to retain them\nwithin it, or breathe them forth in other ears than mine: there was\nenough of confidence between us already. It seemed wrong that there\nshould exist a secret understanding between my husband's friend and me,\nunknown to him, of which he was the object. But my after-thought was,\n\"If it is wrong, surely Arthur's is the fault, not mine.\"\nAnd indeed I know not whether, at the time, it was not for _him_ rather\nthan myself that I blushed; for, since he and I are one, I so identify\nmyself with him, that I feel his degradation, his failings, and\ntransgressions as my own: I blush for him, I fear for him; I repent for\nhim, weep, pray, and feel for him as for myself; but I cannot act for\nhim; and hence I must be, and I am, debased, contaminated by the union,\nboth in my own eyes and in the actual truth. I am so determined to love\nhim, so intensely anxious to excuse his errors, that I am continually\ndwelling upon them, and labouring to extenuate the loosest of his\nprinciples and the worst of his practices, till I am familiarised with\nvice, and almost a partaker in his sins. Things that formerly shocked\nand disgusted me, now seem only natural. I know them to be wrong,\nbecause reason and God's word declare them to be so; but I am gradually\nlosing that instinctive horror and repulsion which were given me by\nnature, or instilled into me by the precepts and example of my aunt.\nPerhaps then I was too severe in my judgments, for I abhorred the\nsinner as well as the sin; now I flatter myself I am more charitable\nand considerate; but am I not becoming more indifferent and insensate\ntoo? Fool that I was, to dream that I had strength and purity enough to\nsave myself and him! Such vain presumption would be rightly served, if\nI should perish with him in the gulf from which I sought to save him!\nYet, God preserve me from it, and him too! Yes, poor Arthur, I will\nstill hope and pray for you; and though I write as if you were some\nabandoned wretch, past hope and past reprieve, it is only my anxious\nfears, my strong desires that make me do so; one who loved you less\nwould be less bitter, less dissatisfied.\nHis conduct has, of late, been what the world calls irreproachable; but\nthen I know his heart is still unchanged; and I know that spring is\napproaching, and deeply dread the consequences.\nAs he began to recover the tone and vigour of his exhausted frame, and\nwith it something of his former impatience of retirement and repose, I\nsuggested a short residence by the sea-side, for his recreation and\nfurther restoration, and for the benefit of our little one as well. But\nno: watering-places were so intolerably dull; besides, he had been\ninvited by one of his friends to spend a month or two in Scotland for\nthe better recreation of grouse-shooting and deer-stalking, and had\npromised to go.\n\"Then you will leave me again, Arthur?\" said I.\n\"Yes, dearest, but only to love you the better when I come back, and\nmake up for all past offences and short-comings; and you needn't fear\nme this time: there are no temptations on the mountains. And during my\nabsence you may pay a visit to Staningley, if you like: your uncle and\naunt have long been wanting us to go there, you know; but somehow\nthere's such a repulsion between the good lady and me, that I never\ncould bring myself up to the scratch.\"\nAbout the third week in August, Arthur set out for Scotland, and Mr.\nHargrave accompanied him thither, to my private satisfaction. Shortly\nafter, I, with little Arthur and Rachel, went to Staningley, my dear\nold home, which, as well as my dear old friends its inhabitants, I saw\nagain with mingled feelings of pleasure and pain so intimately blended\nthat I could scarcely distinguish the one from the other, or tell to\nwhich to attribute the various tears, and smiles, and sighs awakened by\nthose old familiar scenes, and tones, and faces.\nArthur did not come home till several weeks after my return to\nGrassdale; but I did not feel so anxious about him now; to think of him\nengaged in active sports among the wild hills of Scotland, was very\ndifferent from knowing him to be immersed amid the corruptions and\ntemptations of London. His letters now; though neither long nor\nloverlike, were more regular than ever they had been before; and when\nhe did return, to my great joy, instead of being worse than when he\nwent, he was more cheerful and vigorous, and better in every respect.\nSince that time I have had little cause to complain. He still has an\nunfortunate predilection for the pleasures of the table, against which\nI have to struggle and watch; but he has begun to notice his boy, and\nthat is an increasing source of amusement to him within-doors, while\nhis fox-hunting and coursing are a sufficient occupation for him\nwithout, when the ground is not hardened by frost; so that he is not\nwholly dependent on me for entertainment. But it is now January; spring\nis approaching; and, I repeat, I dread the consequences of its arrival.",

During the first few days I thought she seemed very\nsolicitous to win his admiration. Her efforts were not unnoticed by\nhim: I frequently saw him smiling to himself at her artful man\u0153uvres:\nbut, to his praise be it spoken, her shafts fell powerless by his side.\nHer most bewitching smiles, her haughtiest frowns were ever received\nwith the same immutable, careless good-humour; till, finding he was\nindeed impenetrable, she suddenly remitted her efforts, and became, to\nall appearance, as perfectly indifferent as himself.

But I thought of\nyou in the midst of those lawless roysterers; and I endeavoured to\npersuade Mr. Huntingdon to think of you too; but to no purpose: I fear\nhe is fully determined to enjoy himself this night; and it will be no\nuse keeping the coffee waiting for him or his companions; it will be\nmuch if they join us at tea. Meantime, I earnestly wish I could banish\nthe thoughts of them from your mind\u2014and my own too, for I hate to think\nof them\u2014yes\u2014even of my dear friend Huntingdon, when I consider the\npower he possesses over the happiness of one so immeasurably superior\nto himself, and the use he makes of it\u2014I positively _detest_ the man!\"\n\"You had better not say so to me, then,\" said I; \"for, bad as he is, he\nis part of myself, and you cannot abuse him without offending me.\"\n\"Pardon me, then, for I would sooner die than offend you. But let us\nsay no more of him for the present, if you please.\"\nAt last they came; but not till after ten, when tea, which had been\ndelayed for more than half an hour, was nearly over. Much as I had\nlonged for their coming, my heart failed me at the riotous uproar of\ntheir approach; and Milicent turned pale, and almost started from her\nseat, as Mr. Hattersley burst into the room with a clamorous volley of\noaths in his mouth, which Hargrave endeavoured to check by entreating\nhim to remember the ladies.\n\"Ah! you do well to remind me of the ladies, you dastardly deserter,\"\ncried he, shaking his formidable fist at his brother-in-law. \"If it\nwere not for them, you well know, I'd demolish you in the twinkling of\nan eye, and give your body to the fowls of heaven and the lilies of the\nfields!\" Then, planting a chair by Lady Lowborough's side, he stationed\nhimself in it, and began to talk to her with a mixture of absurdity and\nimpudence that seemed rather to amuse than to offend her; though she\naffected to resent his insolence, and to keep him at bay with sallies\nof smart and spirited repartee.\nMeantime Mr. Grimsby seated himself by me, in the chair vacated by\nHargrave as they entered, and gravely stated that he would thank me for\na cup of tea: and Arthur placed himself beside poor Milicent,\nconfidentially pushing his head into her face, and drawing in closer to\nher as she shrank away from him. He was not so noisy as Hattersley, but\nhis face was exceedingly flushed: he laughed incessantly, and while I\nblushed for all I saw and heard of him, I was glad that he chose to\ntalk to his companion in so low a tone that no one could hear what he\nsaid but herself.\n\"What fools they are!\" drawled Mr. Grimsby, who had been talking away,\nat my elbow, with sententious gravity all the time; but I had been too\nmuch absorbed in contemplating the deplorable state of the other\ntwo\u2014especially Arthur\u2014to attend to him.\n\"Did you ever hear such nonsense as they talk, Mrs. Huntingdon?\" he\ncontinued. \"I'm quite ashamed of them for my part: they can't take so\nmuch as a bottle between them without its getting into their heads\u2014\"\n\"You are pouring the cream into your saucer, Mr. Grimsby.\"\n\"Ah! yes, I see, but we're almost in darkness here. Hargrave, snuff\nthose candles, will you?\"\n\"They're wax; they don't require snuffing,\" said I.\n\"'The light of the body is the eye,'\" observed Hargrave, with a\nsarcastic smile. \"'If thine eye be _single_, thy whole body shall be\nfull of light.'\"\nGrimsby repulsed him with a solemn wave of the hand, and then turning\nto me, continued, with the same drawling tones and strange uncertainty\nof utterance and heavy gravity of aspect as before: \"But as I was\nsaying, Mrs. Huntingdon, they have no head at all: they can't take half\na bottle without being affected some way; whereas I\u2014well, I've taken\nthree times as much as they have to-night, and you see I'm perfectly\nsteady. Now that may strike you as very singular, but I think I can\nexplain it: you see _their_ brains\u2014I mention no names, but you'll\nunderstand to whom I allude\u2014_their_ brains are light to begin with, and\nthe fumes of the fermented liquor render them lighter still, and\nproduce an entire light-headedness, or giddiness, resulting in\nintoxication; whereas my brains, being composed of more solid\nmaterials, will absorb a considerable quantity of this alcoholic vapour\nwithout the production of any sensible result\u2014\"\n\"I think you will find a sensible result produced on that tea,\"\ninterrupted Mr. Hargrave, \"by the quantity of sugar you have put into\nit. Instead of your usual complement of one lump, you have put in six.\"\n\"Have I so?\" replied the philosopher, diving with his spoon into the\ncup, and bringing up several half-dissolved pieces in confirmation of\nthe assertion. \"Hum! I perceive. Thus, Madam, you see the evil of\nabsence of mind\u2014of thinking too much while engaged in the common\nconcerns of life. Now, if I had had my wits about me, like ordinary\nmen, instead of within me like a philosopher, I should not have spoiled\nthis cup of tea, and been constrained to trouble you for another.\"\n\"That is the sugar-basin, Mr. Grimsby. Now you have spoiled the sugar\ntoo; and I'll thank you to ring for some more, for here is Lord\nLowborough at last; and I hope his lordship will condescend to sit down\nwith us, such as we are, and allow me to give him some tea.\"\nHis lordship gravely bowed in answer to my appeal, but said nothing.\nMeantime, Hargrave volunteered to ring for the sugar, while Grimsby\nlamented his mistake, and attempted to prove that it was owing to the\nshadow of the urn and the badness of the lights.\nLord Lowborough had entered a minute or two before, unobserved by\nanyone but me, and had been standing before the door, grimly surveying\nthe company. He now stepped up to Annabella, who sat with her back\ntowards him, with Hattersley still beside her, though not now attending\nto her, being occupied in vociferously abusing and bullying his host.\n\"Well, Annabella,\" said her husband, as he leant over the back of her\nchair, \"which of these three 'bold, manly spirits' would you have me to\nresemble?\"\n\"By heaven and earth, you shall resemble us all!\" cried Hattersley,\nstarting up and rudely seizing him by the arm. \"Hallo, Huntingdon!\" he\nshouted\u2014\"_I've_ got him! Come, man, and help me! And d\u2014n me, if I don't\nmake him drunk before I let him go! He shall make up for all past\ndelinquencies as sure as I'm a living soul!\"\nThere followed a disgraceful contest: Lord Lowborough, in desperate\nearnest, and pale with anger, silently struggling to release himself\nfrom the powerful madman that was striving to drag him from the room. I\nattempted to urge Arthur to interfere in behalf of his outraged guest,\nbut he could do nothing but laugh.\n\"Huntingdon, you fool, come and help me, can't you!\" cried Hattersley,\nhimself somewhat weakened by his excesses.\n\"I'm wishing you God-speed, Hattersley,\" cried Arthur, \"and aiding you\nwith my prayers: I can't do anything else if my life depended on it!\nI'm quite used up. Oh\u2014oh!\" and leaning back in his seat, he clapped his\nhands on his sides and groaned aloud.\n\"Annabella, give me a candle!\" said Lowborough, whose antagonist had\nnow got him round the waist and was endeavouring to root him from the\ndoor-post, to which he madly clung with all the energy of desperation.\n\"_I_ shall take no part in your rude sports!\" replied the lady coldly\ndrawing back. \"I wonder you can expect it.\"\nBut I snatched up a candle and brought it to him. He took it and held\nthe flame to Hattersley's hands, till, roaring like a wild beast, the\nlatter unclasped them and let him go. He vanished, I suppose to his own\napartment, for nothing more was seen of him till the morning. Swearing\nand cursing like a maniac, Hattersley threw himself on to the ottoman\nbeside the window. The door being now free, Milicent attempted to make\nher escape from the scene of her husband's disgrace; but he called her\nback, and insisted upon her coming to him.\n\"What do you want, Ralph?\" murmured she, reluctantly approaching him.\n\"I want to know what's the matter with you,\" said he, pulling her on to\nhis knee like a child. \"What are you crying for, Milicent?\u2014Tell me!\"\n\"I'm not crying.\"\n\"You are,\" persisted he, rudely pulling her hands from her face. \"How\ndare you tell such a lie!\"\n\"I'm not crying now,\" pleaded she.\n\"But you have been, and just this minute too; and I _will_ know what\nfor. Come, now, you _shall_ tell me!\"\n\"Do let me alone, Ralph! Remember, we are not at home.\"\n\"No matter: you _shall_ answer my question!\" exclaimed her tormentor;\nand he attempted to extort the confession by shaking her, and\nremorselessly crushing her slight arms in the gripe of his powerful\nfingers.\n\"Don't let him treat your sister in that way,\" said I to Mr. Hargrave.\n\"Come now, Hattersley, I can't allow that,\" said that gentleman,\nstepping up to the ill-assorted couple. \"Let my sister alone, if you\nplease.\"\nAnd he made an effort to unclasp the ruffian's fingers from her arm,\nbut was suddenly driven backward, and nearly laid upon the floor by a\nviolent blow on the chest, accompanied with the admonition, \"Take that\nfor your insolence! and learn to interfere between me and mine again.\"\n\"If you were not drunk, I'd have satisfaction for that!\" gasped\nHargrave, white and breathless as much from passion as from the\nimmediate effects of the blow.\n\"Go to the devil!\" responded his brother-in-law. \"Now, Milicent, tell\nme what you were crying for.\"\n\"I'll tell you some other time,\" murmured she, \"when we are alone.\"\n\"Tell me now!\" said he, with another shake and a squeeze that made her\ndraw in her breath and bite her lip to suppress a cry of pain.\n\"_I'll_ tell you, Mr. Hattersley,\" said I. \"She was crying from pure\nshame and humiliation for you; because she could not bear to see you\nconduct yourself so disgracefully.\"\n\"Confound you, Madam!\" muttered he, with a stare of stupid amazement at\nmy \"impudence.\" \"It was _not_ that\u2014was it, Milicent?\"\nShe was silent.\n\"Come, speak up, child!\"\n\"I can't tell now,\" sobbed she.\n\"But you can say 'yes' or 'no' as well as 'I can't tell.'\u2014Come!\"\n\"Yes,\" she whispered, hanging her head, and blushing at the awful\nacknowledgment.\n\"Curse you for an impertinent hussy, then!\" cried he, throwing her from\nhim with such violence that she fell on her side; but she was up again\nbefore either I or her brother could come to her assistance, and made\nthe best of her way out of the room, and, I suppose, up-stairs, without\nloss of time.\nThe next object of assault was Arthur, who sat opposite, and had, no\ndoubt, richly enjoyed the whole scene.\n\"Now, Huntingdon,\" exclaimed his irascible friend, \"I WILL NOT have you\nsitting there and laughing like an idiot!\"\n\"Oh, Hattersley,\" cried he, wiping his swimming eyes\u2014\"you'll be the\ndeath of me.\"\n\"Yes, I will, but not as you suppose: I'll have the heart out of your\nbody, man, if you irritate me with any more of that imbecile\nlaughter!\u2014What! are you at it yet?\u2014There! see if that'll settle you!\"\ncried Hattersley, snatching up a footstool and hurting it at the head\nof his host; but he as well as missed his aim, and the latter still sat\ncollapsed and quaking with feeble laughter, with tears running down his\nface: a deplorable spectacle indeed.\nHattersley tried cursing and swearing, but it would not do: he then\ntook a number of books from the table beside him, and threw them, one\nby one, at the object of his wrath; but Arthur only laughed the more;\nand, finally, Hattersley rushed upon him in a frenzy and seizing him by\nthe shoulders, gave him a violent shaking, under which he laughed and\nshrieked alarmingly. But I saw no more: I thought I had witnessed\nenough of my husband's degradation; and leaving Annabella and the rest\nto follow when they pleased, I withdrew, but not to bed. Dismissing\nRachel to her rest, I walked up and down my room, in an agony of misery\nfor what had been done, and suspense, not knowing what might further\nhappen, or how or when that unhappy creature would come up to bed.\nAt last he came, slowly and stumblingly ascending the stairs, supported\nby Grimsby and Hattersley, who neither of them walked quite steadily\nthemselves, but were both laughing and joking at him, and making noise\nenough for all the servants to hear. He himself was no longer laughing\nnow, but sick and stupid. I will write no more about _that_.",

I've been looking at\nthem a bit this morning; and upon my word, Black Boss, and Grey Tom,\nand that young Nimrod are the finest animals I've seen for many a day!\"\nThen followed a particular discussion of their various merits,\nsucceeded by a sketch of the great things _he_ intended to do in the\nhorse-jockey line, when his old governor thought proper to quit the\nstage. \"Not that I wish him to close his accounts,\" added he: \"the old\nTrojan is welcome to keep his books open as long as he pleases for me.\"\n\"I hope so, _indeed_, Mr. Hattersley.\"\n\"Oh, yes! It's only my way of talking. The event must come some time,\nand so I look to the bright side of it: that's the right plan\u2014isn't it,\nMrs. H.? What are you two doing here? By-the-by, where's Lady\nLowborough?\"\n\"In the billiard-room.\"\n\"What a splendid creature she _is!_\" continued he, fixing his eyes on\nhis wife, who changed colour, and looked more and more disconcerted as\nhe proceeded. \"What a noble figure she has; and what magnificent black\neyes; and what a fine spirit of her own; and what a tongue of her own,\ntoo, when she likes to use it. I perfectly adore her! But never mind,\nMilicent: I wouldn't have her for my wife, not if she'd a kingdom for\nher dowry! I'm better satisfied with the one I have. Now _then!_ what\ndo you look so sulky for? don't you believe me?\"\n\"Yes, I believe you,\" murmured she, in a tone of half sad, half sullen\nresignation, as she turned away to stroke the hair of her sleeping\ninfant, that she had laid on the sofa beside her.\n\"Well, _then_, what makes you so cross? Come here, Milly, and tell me\nwhy you can't be satisfied with my assurance.\"\nShe went, and putting her little hand within his arm, looked up in his\nface, and said softly,\u2014\n\"What does it amount to, Ralph? Only to this, that though you admire\nAnnabella so much, and for qualities that I don't possess, you would\nstill rather have me than her for your wife, which merely proves that\nyou don't think it necessary to love your wife; you are satisfied if\nshe can keep your house, and take care of your child. But I'm not\ncross; I'm only sorry; for,\" added she, in a low, tremulous accent,\nwithdrawing her hand from his arm, and bending her looks on the rug,\n\"if you don't love me, you don't, and it can't be helped.\"\n\"Very true; but who told you I didn't? Did I say I loved Annabella?\"\n\"You said you adored her.\"\n\"True, but adoration isn't love. I adore Annabella, but I don't love\nher; and I love thee, Milicent, but I don't adore thee.\" In proof of\nhis affection, he clutched a handful of her light brown ringlets, and\nappeared to twist them unmercifully.\n\"Do you really, Ralph?\" murmured she, with a faint smile beaming\nthrough her tears, just putting up her hand to his, in token that he\npulled _rather_ too hard.\n\"To be sure I do,\" responded he: \"only you bother me rather,\nsometimes.\"\n\"_I_ bother you!\" cried she, in very natural surprise.\n\"Yes, _you_\u2014but only by your exceeding goodness. When a boy has been\neating raisins and sugar-plums all day, he longs for a squeeze of sour\norange by way of a change. And did you never, Milly, observe the sands\non the sea-shore; how nice and smooth they look, and how soft and easy\nthey feel to the foot? But if you plod along, for half an hour, over\nthis soft, easy carpet\u2014giving way at every step, yielding the more the\nharder you press,\u2014you'll find it rather wearisome work, and be glad\nenough to come to a bit of good, firm rock, that won't budge an inch\nwhether you stand, walk, or stamp upon it; and, though it be hard as\nthe nether millstone, you'll find it the easier footing after all.\"\n\"I know what you mean, Ralph,\" said she, nervously playing with her\nwatchguard and tracing the figure on the rug with the point of her tiny\nfoot\u2014\"I know what you mean: but I thought you always liked to be\nyielded to, and I can't alter now.\"\n\"I do like it,\" replied he, bringing her to him by another tug at her\nhair. \"You mustn't mind my talk, Milly. A man must have something to\ngrumble about; and if he can't complain that his wife harries him to\ndeath with her perversity and ill-humour, he must complain that she\nwears him out with her kindness and gentleness.\"\n\"But why complain at all, unless because you are tired and\ndissatisfied?\"\n\"To excuse my own failings, to be sure.

Did you not tell Mr.\nHuntingdon you must have one that would submit to anything without a\nmurmur, and never blame you, whatever you did?\"\n\"True, but we shouldn't always have what we want: it spoils the best of\nus, doesn't it? How can I help playing the deuce when I see it's all\none to her whether I behave like a Christian or like a scoundrel, such\nas nature made me? and how can I help teasing her when she's so\ninvitingly meek and mim, when she lies down like a spaniel at my feet\nand never so much as squeaks to tell me that's enough?\"\n\"If you are a tyrant by nature, the temptation is strong, I allow; but\nno generous mind delights to oppress the weak, but rather to cherish\nand protect.\"\n\"I _don't_ oppress her; but it's so confounded flat to be always\ncherishing and protecting; and then, how can I tell that I _am_\noppressing her when she 'melts away and makes no sign'? I sometimes\nthink she has no feeling at all; and then I go on till she cries, and\nthat satisfies me.\"\n\"Then you _do_ delight to oppress her?\"\n\"I don't, I tell you! only when I'm in a bad humour, or a particularly\ngood one, and want to afflict for the pleasure of comforting; or when\nshe looks flat and wants shaking up a bit. And sometimes she provokes\nme by crying for nothing, and won't tell me what it's for; and then, I\nallow, it enrages me past bearing, especially when I'm not my own man.\"\n\"As is no doubt generally the case on such occasions,\" said I. \"But in\nfuture, Mr. Hattersley, when you see her looking flat, or crying for\n'nothing' (as you call it), ascribe it all to yourself: be assured it\nis something you have done amiss, or your general misconduct, that\ndistresses her.\"\n\"I don't believe it. If it were, she should tell me so: I don't like\nthat way of moping and fretting in silence, and saying nothing: it's\nnot honest. How can she expect me to mend my ways at that rate?\"\n\"Perhaps she gives you credit for having more sense than you possess,\nand deludes herself with the hope that you will one day see your own\nerrors and repair them, if left to your own reflection.\"\n\"None of your sneers, Mrs. Huntingdon. I _have_ the sense to see that\nI'm not always quite correct, but sometimes I think that's no great\nmatter, as long as I injure nobody but myself\u2014\"\n\"It _is_ a great matter,\" interrupted I, \"both to yourself (as you will\nhereafter find to your cost) and to all connected with you, most\nespecially your wife. But, indeed, it is nonsense to talk about\ninjuring no one but yourself: it is impossible to injure yourself,\nespecially by such acts as we allude to, without injuring hundreds, if\nnot thousands, besides, in a greater or less, degree, either by the\nevil you do or the good you leave undone.\"\n\"And as I was saying,\" continued he, \"or would have said if you hadn't\ntaken me up so short, I sometimes think I should do better if I were\njoined to one that would always remind me when I was wrong, and give me\na motive for doing good and eschewing evil, by decidedly showing her\napproval of the one and disapproval of the other.\"\n\"If you had no higher motive than the approval of your fellow-mortal,\nit would do you little good.\"\n\"Well, but if I had a mate that would not always be yielding, and\nalways equally kind, but that would have the spirit to stand at bay now\nand then, and honestly tell me her mind at all times, such a one as\nyourself for instance. Now, if I went on with you as I do with her when\nI'm in London, you'd make the house too hot to hold me at times, I'll\nbe sworn.\"\n\"You mistake me: I'm no termagant.\"\n\"Well, all the better for that, for I can't stand contradiction, in a\ngeneral way, and I'm as fond of my own will as another; only I think\ntoo much of it doesn't answer for any man.\"\n\"Well, I would never contradict you without a cause, but certainly I\nwould always let you know what I thought of your conduct; and if you\noppressed me, in body, mind, or estate, you should at least have no\nreason to suppose 'I didn't mind it.'\"\n\"I know that, my lady; and I think if my little wife were to follow the",

It shows, at least, that the\naffection is genuine: he is not sick of me yet.\n\"I startled you, Arthur,\" said I, laughing in my glee. \"How nervous you\nare!\"\n\"What the deuce did you do it for?\" cried he, quite testily,\nextricating himself from my arms, and wiping his forehead with his\nhandkerchief. \"Go back, Helen\u2014go back directly! You'll get your death\nof cold!\"\n\"I won't, till I've told you what I came for. They are blaming you,\nArthur, for your temperance and sobriety, and I'm come to thank you for\nit. They say it is all 'these cursed women,' and that we are the bane\nof the world; but don't let them laugh or grumble you out of your good\nresolutions, or your affection for me.\"\nHe laughed. I squeezed him in my arms again, and cried in tearful\nearnest, \"Do, do persevere! and I'll love you better than ever I did\nbefore!\"\n\"Well, well, I will!\" said he, hastily kissing me. \"There, now, go. You\nmad creature, how _could_ you come out in your light evening dress this\nchill autumn night?\"\n\"It is a glorious night,\" said I.\n\"It is a night that will give you your death, in another minute. Run\naway, do!\"\n\"Do you see my death among those trees, Arthur?\" said I, for he was\ngazing intently at the shrubs, as if he saw it coming, and I was\nreluctant to leave him, in my new-found happiness and revival of hope\nand love.

            "text": "Almost immediately after dinner Annabella went out with her husband to\nshare his moonlight ramble, for it was a splendid evening like the\nlast. Mr. Hargrave entered the drawing-room a little before the others,\nand challenged me to a game of chess. He did it without any of that sad\nbut proud humility he usually assumes in addressing me, unless he is\nexcited with wine. I looked at his face to see if that was the case\nnow. His eye met mine keenly, but steadily: there was something about\nhim I did not understand, but he seemed sober enough. Not choosing to\nengage with him, I referred him to Milicent.\n\"She plays badly,\" said he, \"I want to match my skill with yours. Come\nnow! you can't pretend you are reluctant to lay down your work. I know\nyou never take it up except to pass an idle hour, when there is nothing\nbetter you can do.\"\n\"But chess-players are so unsociable,\" I objected; \"they are no company\nfor any but themselves.\"\n\"There is no one here but Milicent, and she\u2014\"\n\"Oh, I shall be delighted to watch you!\" cried our mutual friend. \"Two\n_such_ players\u2014it will be quite a treat! I wonder which will conquer.\"\nI consented.\n\"Now, Mrs. Huntingdon,\" said Hargrave, as he arranged the men on the\nboard, speaking distinctly, and with a peculiar emphasis, as if he had\na double meaning to all his words, \"you are a good player, but I am a\nbetter: we shall have a long game, and you will give me some trouble;\nbut I can be as patient as you, and in the end I shall certainly win.\"\nHe fixed his eyes upon me with a glance I did not like, keen, crafty,\nbold, and almost impudent;\u2014already half triumphant in his anticipated\nsuccess.\n\"I hope not, Mr. Hargrave!\" returned I, with vehemence that must have\nstartled Milicent at least; but _he_ only smiled and murmured, \"Time\nwill show.\"\nWe set to work: he sufficiently interested in the game, but calm and\nfearless in the consciousness of superior skill: I, intensely eager to\ndisappoint his expectations, for I considered this the type of a more\nserious contest, as I imagined he did, and I felt an almost\nsuperstitious dread of being beaten: at all events, I could ill endure\nthat present success should add one tittle to his conscious power (his\ninsolent self-confidence I ought to say), or encourage for a moment his\ndream of future conquest. His play was cautious and deep, but I\nstruggled hard against him. For some time the combat was doubtful: at\nlength, to my joy, the victory seemed inclining to my side: I had taken\nseveral of his best pieces, and manifestly baffled his projects. He put\nhis hand to his brow and paused, in evident perplexity. I rejoiced in\nmy advantage, but dared not glory in it yet. At length, he lifted his\nhead, and quietly making his move, looked at me and said, calmly, \"Now\nyou think you will win, don't you?\"\n\"I hope so,\" replied I, taking his pawn that he had pushed into the way\nof my bishop with so careless an air that I thought it was an\noversight, but was not generous enough, under the circumstances, to\ndirect his attention to it, and too heedless, at the moment, to foresee\nthe after-consequences of my move. \"It is those bishops that trouble\nme,\" said he; \"but the bold knight can overleap the reverend\ngentlemen,\" taking my last bishop with his knight; \"and now, those\nsacred persons once removed, I shall carry all before me.\"\n\"Oh, Walter, how you talk!\" cried Milicent; \"she has far more pieces\nthan you still.\"\n\"I intend to give you some trouble yet,\" said I; \"and perhaps, sir, you\nwill find yourself checkmated before you are aware. Look to your\nqueen.\"\nThe combat deepened. The game was a long one, and I _did_ give him some\ntrouble: but he was a better player than I.\n\"What keen gamesters you are!\" said Mr. Hattersley, who had now\nentered, and been watching us for some time. \"Why, Mrs. Huntingdon,\nyour hand trembles as if you had staked your all upon it! and, Walter,\nyou dog, you look as deep and cool as if you were certain of success,\nand as keen and cruel as if you would drain her heart's blood! But if I\nwere you, I wouldn't beat her, for very fear: she'll hate you if you\ndo\u2014she will, by heaven! I see it in her eye.\"\n\"Hold your tongue, will you?\" said I: his talk distracted me, for I was\ndriven to extremities. A few more moves, and I was inextricably\nentangled in the snare of my antagonist.\n\"Check,\" cried he: I sought in agony some means of escape. \"Mate!\" he\nadded, quietly, but with evident delight. He had suspended the\nutterance of that last fatal syllable the better to enjoy my dismay. I\nwas foolishly disconcerted by the event. Hattersley laughed; Milicent\nwas troubled to see me so disturbed. Hargrave placed his hand on mine\nthat rested on the table, and squeezing it with a firm but gentle\npressure, murmured, \"Beaten, beaten!\" and gazed into my face with a\nlook where exultation was blended with an expression of ardour and\ntenderness yet more insulting.",

The torment of suspense was not to\nbe endured: I would not suspect my husband falsely, on this man's\naccusation, and I would not trust him unworthily\u2014I must know the truth\nat once. I flew to the shrubbery. Scarcely had I reached it, when a\nsound of voices arrested my breathless speed.\n\"We have lingered too long; he will be back,\" said Lady Lowborough's\nvoice.\n\"Surely not, dearest!\" was _his_ reply; \"but you can run across the\nlawn, and get in as quietly as you can; I'll follow in a while.\"\nMy knees trembled under me; my brain swam round. I was ready to faint.\nShe must not see me thus. I shrunk among the bushes, and leant against\nthe trunk of a tree to let her pass.\n\"Ah, Huntingdon!\" said she reproachfully, pausing where I had stood\nwith him the night before\u2014\"it was here you kissed that woman!\" she\nlooked back into the leafy shade. Advancing thence, he answered, with a\ncareless laugh,\u2014\n\"Well, dearest, I couldn't help it. You know I must keep straight with\nher as long as I can. Haven't I seen you kiss your dolt of a husband\nscores of times?\u2014and do _I_ ever complain?\"\n\"But tell me, don't you love her still\u2014a _little?_\" said she, placing\nher hand on his arm, looking earnestly in his face\u2014for I could see\nthem, plainly, the moon shining full upon them from between the\nbranches of the tree that sheltered me.\n\"Not _one bit_, by all that's sacred!\" he replied, kissing her glowing\ncheek.\n\"Good heavens, I _must_ be gone!\" cried she, suddenly breaking from\nhim, and away she flew.\nThere he stood before me; but I had not strength to confront him now:\nmy tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth; I was well-nigh sinking to\nthe earth, and I almost wondered he did not hear the beating of my\nheart above the low sighing of the wind and the fitful rustle of the\nfalling leaves. My senses seemed to fail me, but still I saw his\nshadowy form pass before me, and through the rushing sound in my ears I\ndistinctly heard him say, as he stood looking up the lawn,\u2014\"There goes\nthe fool! Run, Annabella, run! There\u2014in with you! Ah,\u2014he didn't see!\nThat's right, Grimsby, keep him back!\" And even his low laugh reached\nme as he walked away.\n\"God help me now!\" I murmured, sinking on my knees among the damp weeds\nand brushwood that surrounded me, and looking up at the moonlit sky,\nthrough the scant foliage above. It seemed all dim and quivering now to\nmy darkened sight. My burning, bursting heart strove to pour forth its\nagony to God, but could not frame its anguish into prayer; until a gust\nof wind swept over me, which, while it scattered the dead leaves, like\nblighted hopes, around, cooled my forehead, and seemed a little to\nrevive my sinking frame. Then, while I lifted up my soul in speechless,\nearnest supplication, some heavenly influence seemed to strengthen me\nwithin: I breathed more freely; my vision cleared; I saw distinctly the\npure moon shining on, and the light clouds skimming the clear, dark\nsky; and then I saw the eternal stars twinkling down upon me; I knew\ntheir God was mine, and He was strong to save and swift to hear. \"I\nwill never leave thee, nor forsake thee,\" seemed whispered from above\ntheir myriad orbs. No, no; I felt He would not leave me comfortless: in\nspite of earth and hell I should have strength for all my trials, and\nwin a glorious rest at last!\nRefreshed, invigorated, if not composed, I rose and returned to the\nhouse. Much of my new-born strength and courage forsook me, I confess,\nas I entered it, and shut out the fresh wind and the glorious sky:\neverything I saw and heard seemed to sicken my heart\u2014the hall, the\nlamp, the staircase, the doors of the different apartments, the social\nsound of talk and laughter from the drawing-room. How could I bear my\nfuture life! In this house, among those people\u2014oh, how could I endure\nto live! John just then entered the hall, and seeing me, told me he had\nbeen sent in search of me, adding that he had taken in the tea, and\nmaster wished to know if I were coming.\n\"Ask Mrs. Hattersley to be so kind as to make the tea, John,\" said I.\n\"Say I am not well to-night, and wish to be excused.\"\nI retired into the large, empty dining-room, where all was silence and\ndarkness, but for the soft sighing of the wind without, and the faint\ngleam of moonlight that pierced the blinds and curtains; and there I\nwalked rapidly up and down, thinking of my bitter thoughts alone. How\ndifferent was this from the evening of yesterday! _That_, it seems, was\nthe last expiring flash of my life's happiness. Poor, blinded fool that\nI was to be so happy! I could now see the reason of Arthur's strange\nreception of me in the shrubbery; the burst of kindness was for his\nparamour, the start of horror for his wife. Now, too, I could better\nunderstand the conversation between Hattersley and Grimsby; it was\ndoubtless of his love for _her_ they spoke, not for me.\nI heard the drawing-room door open: a light quick step came out of the\nante-room, crossed the hall, and ascended the stairs. It was Milicent,\npoor Milicent, gone to see how I was\u2014no one else cared for me; but\n_she_ still was kind. I shed no tears before, but now they came, fast\nand free. Thus she did me good, without approaching me. Disappointed in\nher search, I heard her come down, more slowly than she had ascended.\nWould she come in there, and find me out? No, she turned in the\nopposite direction and re-entered the drawing-room. I was glad, for I\nknew not how to meet her, or what to say. I wanted no confidante in my\ndistress. I deserved none, and I wanted none. I had taken the burden\nupon myself; let me bear it alone.\nAs the usual hour of retirement approached I dried my eyes, and tried\nto clear my voice and calm my mind. I must see Arthur to-night, and\nspeak to him; but I would do it calmly: there should be no\nscene\u2014nothing to complain or to boast of to his companions\u2014nothing to\nlaugh at with his lady-love. When the company were retiring to their\nchambers I gently opened the door, and just as he passed, beckoned him\nin.\n\"What's to do with _you_, Helen?\" said he. \"Why couldn't you come to\nmake tea for us? and what the deuce are you here for, in the dark? What\nails you, young woman: you look like a ghost!\" he continued, surveying\nme by the light of his candle.\n\"No matter,\" I answered, \"to you; you have no longer any regard for me\nit appears; and I have no longer any for you.\"\n\"Hal-lo! what the devil is this?\" he muttered.\n\"I would leave you to-morrow,\" continued I, \"and never again come under\nthis roof, but for my child\"\u2014I paused a moment to steady, my voice.\n\"What in the devil's name _is_ this, Helen?\" cried he. \"What can you be\ndriving at?\"\n\"You know perfectly well. Let us waste no time in useless explanation,\nbut tell me, will you\u2014?\"\nHe vehemently swore he knew nothing about it, and insisted upon hearing\nwhat poisonous old woman had been blackening his name, and what\ninfamous lies I had been fool enough to believe.\n\"Spare yourself the trouble of forswearing yourself and racking your\nbrains to stifle truth with falsehood,\" I coldly replied. \"I have\ntrusted to the testimony of no third person. I was in the shrubbery\nthis evening, and I saw and heard for myself.\"\nThis was enough. He uttered a suppressed exclamation of consternation\nand dismay, and muttering, \"I _shall_ catch it now!\" set down his\ncandle on the nearest chair, and rearing his back against the wall,\nstood confronting me with folded arms.\n\"Well, what then?\" said he, with the calm insolence of mingled\nshamelessness and desperation.\n\"Only this,\" returned I; \"will you let me take our child and what\nremains of my fortune, and go?\"\n\"Go where?\"\n\"Anywhere, where he will be safe from your contaminating influence, and\nI shall be delivered from your presence, and you from mine.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Will you let me have the child then, without the money?\"\n\"No, nor yourself without the child. Do you think I'm going to be made\nthe talk of the country for your fastidious caprices?\"\n\"Then I must stay here, to be hated and despised. But henceforth we are\nhusband and wife only in the name.\"\n\"Very good.\"\n\"I am your child's mother, and _your_ housekeeper, nothing more. So you\nneed not trouble yourself any longer to feign the love you cannot feel:\nI will exact no more heartless caresses from you, nor offer nor endure\nthem either. I will not be mocked with the empty husk of conjugal\nendearments, when you have given the substance to another!\"\n\"Very good, if _you_ please. We shall see who will tire first, my\nlady.\"\n\"If I tire, it will be of living in the world with you: not of living\nwithout your mockery of love. When _you_ tire of your sinful ways, and\nshow yourself truly repentant, I will forgive you, and, perhaps, try to\nlove you again, though that will be hard indeed.\"\n\"Humph! and meantime you will go and talk me over to Mrs. Hargrave, and\nwrite long letters to aunt Maxwell to complain of the wicked wretch you\nhave married?\"\n\"I shall complain to no one. Hitherto I have struggled hard to hide\nyour vices from every eye, and invest you with virtues you never\npossessed; but now you must look to yourself.\"\nI left him muttering bad language to himself, and went up-stairs.\n\"You are poorly, ma'am,\" said Rachel, surveying me with deep anxiety.\n\"It is too true, Rachel,\" said I, answering her sad looks rather than\nher words.\n\"I knew it, or I wouldn't have mentioned such a thing.\"\n\"But don't _you_ trouble yourself about it,\" said I, kissing her pale,\ntime-wasted cheek. \"I can bear it better than you imagine.\"\n\"Yes, you were always for 'bearing.' But if I was you I wouldn't bear\nit; I'd give way to it, and cry right hard! and I'd talk too, I just\n_would_\u2014I'd let him know what it was to\u2014\"\n\"I have talked,\" said I; \"I've said enough.\"\n\"Then I'd cry,\" persisted she. \"I wouldn't look so white and so calm,\nand burst my heart with keeping it in.\"\n\"I _have_ cried,\" said I, smiling, in spite of my misery; \"and I _am_\ncalm now, really: so don't discompose me again, nurse: let us say no\nmore about it, and _don't_ mention it to the servants. There, you may\ngo now. Good-night; and don't disturb your rest for me: I shall sleep\nwell\u2014if I can.\"\nNotwithstanding this resolution, I found my bed so intolerable that,\nbefore two o'clock, I rose, and lighting my candle by the rushlight\nthat was still burning, I got my desk and sat down in my dressing-gown\nto recount the events of the past evening. It was better to be so\noccupied than to be lying in bed torturing my brain with recollections\nof the far past and anticipations of the dreadful future. I have found\nrelief in describing the very circumstances that have destroyed my\npeace, as well as the little trivial details attendant upon their\ndiscovery. No sleep I could have got this night would have done so much\ntowards composing my mind, and preparing me to meet the trials of the\nday. I fancy so, at least; and yet, when I cease writing, I find my\nhead aches terribly; and when I look into the glass, I am startled at\nmy haggard, worn appearance.\nRachel has been to dress me, and says I have had a sad night of it, she\ncan see. Milicent has just looked in to ask me how I was. I told her I\nwas better, but to excuse my appearance admitted I had had a restless\nnight. I wish this day were over! I shudder at the thoughts of going\ndown to breakfast. How shall I encounter them all? Yet let me remember\nit is not _I_ that am guilty: _I_ have no cause to fear; and if _they_\nscorn me as a victim of their guilt, I can pity their folly and despise\ntheir scorn.",

            "text": "Mr. Hargrave has annoyed me all day long with his serious,\nsympathising, and (as _he_ thinks) unobtrusive politeness. If it were\nmore obtrusive it would trouble me less, for then I could snub him;\nbut, as it is, he contrives to appear so really kind and thoughtful\nthat I cannot do so without rudeness and seeming ingratitude. I\nsometimes think I ought to give him credit for the good feeling he\nsimulates so well; and then again, I think it is my _duty_ to suspect\nhim under the peculiar circumstances in which I am placed. His kindness\nmay not all be feigned; but still, let not the purest impulse of\ngratitude to him induce me to forget myself: let me remember the game\nof chess, the expressions he used on the occasion, and those\nindescribable looks of his, that so justly roused my indignation, and I\nthink I shall be safe enough. I have done well to record them so\nminutely.\nI think he wishes to find an opportunity of speaking to me alone: he\nhas seemed to be on the watch all day; but I have taken care to\ndisappoint him\u2014not that I fear anything he could say, but I have\ntrouble enough without the addition of his insulting consolations,\ncondolences, or whatever else he might attempt; and, for Milicent's\nsake, I do not wish to quarrel with him. He excused himself from going\nout to shoot with the other gentlemen in the morning, under the pretext\nof having letters to write; and instead of retiring for that purpose\ninto the library, he sent for his desk into the morning-room, where I\nwas seated with Milicent and Lady Lowborough. They had betaken\nthemselves to their work; I, less to divert my mind than to deprecate\nconversation, had provided myself with a book. Milicent saw that I\nwished to be quiet, and accordingly let me alone. Annabella, doubtless,\nsaw it too: but that was no reason why she should restrain her tongue,\nor curb her cheerful spirits: _she_ accordingly chatted away,\naddressing herself almost exclusively to me, and with the utmost\nassurance and familiarity, growing the more animated and friendly the\ncolder and briefer my answers became. Mr. Hargrave saw that I could ill\nendure it, and, looking up from his desk, he answered her questions and\nobservations for me, as far as he could, and attempted to transfer her\nsocial attentions from me to himself; but it would not do. Perhaps she\nthought I had a headache, and could not bear to talk; at any rate, she\nsaw that her loquacious vivacity annoyed me, as I could tell by the\nmalicious pertinacity with which she persisted. But I checked it\neffectually by putting into her hand the book I had been trying to\nread, on the fly-leaf of which I had hastily scribbled,\u2014\n\"I am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any\nreal friendship for you, and as I am without your talent for\ndissimulation, I cannot assume the appearance of it. I must, therefore,\nbeg that hereafter all familiar intercourse may cease between us; and\nif I still continue to treat you with civility, as if you were a woman\nworthy of consideration and respect, understand that it is out of\nregard for your cousin Milicent's feelings, not for yours.\"\nUpon perusing this she turned scarlet, and bit her lip. Covertly\ntearing away the leaf, she crumpled it up and put it in the fire, and\nthen employed herself in turning over the pages of the book, and,\nreally or apparently, perusing its contents. In a little while Milicent\nannounced it her intention to repair to the nursery, and asked if I\nwould accompany her.\n\"Annabella will excuse us,\" said she; \"she's busy reading.\"\n\"No, I won't,\" cried Annabella, suddenly looking up, and throwing her\nbook on the table; \"I want to speak to Helen a minute. You may go,\nMilicent, and she'll follow in a while.\" (Milicent went.) \"Will you\noblige me, Helen?\" continued she.\nHer impudence astounded me; but I complied, and followed her into the\nlibrary. She closed the door, and walked up to the fire.",

Startled, almost appalled, by this sudden outbreak, she\nrecoiled in silence. I would have given way to my fury and said more,\nbut Arthur's low laugh recalled me to myself. I checked the\nhalf-uttered invective, and scornfully turned away, regretting that I\nhad given him so much amusement. He was still laughing when Mr.\nHargrave made his appearance. How much of the scene he had witnessed I\ndo not know, for the door was ajar when he entered. He greeted his host\nand his cousin both coldly, and me with a glance intended to express\nthe deepest sympathy mingled with high admiration and esteem.\n\"How much allegiance do you owe to that man?\" he asked below his\nbreath, as he stood beside me at the window, affecting to be making\nobservations on the weather.\n\"None,\" I answered. And immediately returning to the table, I employed\nmyself in making the tea. He followed, and would have entered into some\nkind of conversation with me, but the other guests were now beginning\nto assemble, and I took no more notice of him, except to give him his\ncoffee.",

I\nnow raised my head; and steadily confronting his gaze, I answered\ncalmly, \"Mr. Hargrave, do you mean to insult me?\"\nHe was not prepared for this. He paused a moment to recover the shock;\nthen, drawing himself up and removing his hand from my chair, he\nanswered, with proud sadness,\u2014\"That was not my intention.\"\nI just glanced towards the door, with a slight movement of the head,\nand then returned to my book. He immediately withdrew. This was better\nthan if I had answered with more words, and in the passionate spirit to\nwhich my first impulse would have prompted. What a good thing it is to\nbe able to command one's temper! I must labour to cultivate this\ninestimable quality: God only knows how often I shall need it in this\nrough, dark road that lies before me.",

With her usual impudence, my companion\nthen made some attempts to get up a conversation; but the monosyllables\n\"yes,\" or \"no\" or \"humph,\" were the utmost her several remarks could\nelicit from me. At last, on her asking my opinion upon some immaterial\npoint of discussion, I answered,\u2014\n\"Why do you wish to talk to me, Lady Lowborough? You must know what I\nthink of you.\"\n\"Well, if you _will_ be so bitter against me,\" replied she, \"I can't\nhelp it; but _I'm_ not going to sulk for anybody.\" Our short drive was\nnow at an end.

Urged by a sudden, imperative\nimpulse to deliver my son from that contaminating influence, I caught\nhim up in my arms and carried him with me out of the room. Not liking\nthis abrupt removal, the child began to pout and cry. This was a new\nstab to my already tortured heart. I would not let him go; but, taking\nhim with me into the library, I shut the door, and, kneeling on the\nfloor beside him, I embraced him, kissed him, wept over with him with\npassionate fondness. Rather frightened than consoled by this, he turned\nstruggling from me, and cried out aloud for his papa. I released him\nfrom my arms, and never were more bitter tears than those that now\nconcealed him from my blinded, burning eyes. Hearing his cries, the\nfather came to the room. I instantly turned away, lest he should see\nand misconstrue my emotion. He swore at me, and took the now pacified\nchild away.\nIt is hard that my little darling should love him more than me; and\nthat, when the well-being and culture of my son is all I have to live\nfor, I should see my influence destroyed by one whose selfish affection\nis more injurious than the coldest indifference or the harshest tyranny\ncould be. If I, for his good, deny him some trifling indulgence, he\ngoes to his father, and the latter, in spite of his selfish indolence,\nwill even give himself some trouble to meet the child's desires: if I\nattempt to curb his will, or look gravely on him for some act of\nchildish disobedience, he knows his other parent will smile and take\nhis part against me. Thus, not only have I the father's spirit in the\nson to contend against, the germs of his evil tendencies to search out\nand eradicate, and his corrupting intercourse and example in after-life\nto counteract, but already _he_ counteracts my arduous labour for the\nchild's advantage, destroys my influence over his tender mind, and robs\nme of his very love; I had no earthly hope but this, and he seems to\ntake a diabolical delight in tearing it away.\nBut it is wrong to despair; I will remember the counsel of the inspired\nwriter to him \"that feareth the Lord and obeyeth the voice of his\nservant, that _sitteth in darkness and hath no light;_ let him trust in\nthe name of the Lord, and stay upon his God!\"",

It was on a pleasant evening\nat the close of May: I was wandering in the park, and he, on seeing me\nthere as he rode past, made bold to enter and approach me, dismounting\nand leaving his horse at the gate. This was the first time he had\nventured to come within its inclosure since I had been left alone,\nwithout the sanction of his mother's or sister's company, or at least\nthe excuse of a message from them. But he managed to appear so calm and\neasy, so respectful and self-possessed in his friendliness, that,\nthough a little surprised, I was neither alarmed nor offended at the\nunusual liberty, and he walked with me under the ash-trees and by the\nwater-side, and talked, with considerable animation, good taste, and\nintelligence, on many subjects, before I began to think about getting\nrid of him. Then, after a pause, during which we both stood gazing on\nthe calm, blue water\u2014I revolving in my mind the best means of politely\ndismissing my companion, he, no doubt, pondering other matters equally\nalien to the sweet sights and sounds that alone were present to his\nsenses,\u2014he suddenly electrified me by beginning, in a peculiar tone,\nlow, soft, but perfectly distinct, to pour forth the most unequivocal\nexpressions of earnest and passionate love; pleading his cause with all\nthe bold yet artful eloquence he could summon to his aid. But I cut\nshort his appeal, and repulsed him so determinately, so decidedly, and\nwith such a mixture of scornful indignation, tempered with cool,\ndispassionate sorrow and pity for his benighted mind, that he withdrew,\nastonished, mortified, and discomforted; and, a few days after, I heard\nthat he had departed for London. He returned, however, in eight or nine\nweeks, and did not entirely keep aloof from me, but comported himself\nin so remarkable a manner that his quick-sighted sister could not fail\nto notice the change.",

            "text": "About a week after Mr. Hargrave brought his sister to see me. He\nconducted himself, at first, with his usual cold, distant,\nhalf-stately, half-melancholy, altogether injured air; but Esther made\nno remark upon it this time: she had evidently been schooled into\nbetter manners. She talked to me, and laughed and romped with little\nArthur, her loved and loving playmate. He, somewhat to my discomfort,\nenticed her from the room to have a run in the hall, and thence into\nthe garden. I got up to stir the fire. Mr. Hargrave asked if I felt\ncold, and shut the door\u2014a very unseasonable piece of officiousness, for\nI had meditated following the noisy playfellows if they did not\nspeedily return. He then took the liberty of walking up to the fire\nhimself, and asking me if I were aware that Mr. Huntingdon was now at\nthe seat of Lord Lowborough, and likely to continue there some time.\n\"No; but it's no matter,\" I answered carelessly; and if my cheek glowed\nlike fire, it was rather at the question than the information it\nconveyed.\n\"You don't object to it?\" he said.\n\"Not at all, if Lord Lowborough likes his company.\"\n\"You have no love left for him, then?\"\n\"Not the least.\"\n\"I knew that\u2014I knew you were too high-minded and pure in your own\nnature to continue to regard one so utterly false and polluted with any\nfeelings but those of indignation and scornful abhorrence!\"\n\"Is he not your friend?\" said I, turning my eyes from the fire to his\nface, with perhaps a slight touch of those feelings he assigned to\nanother.\n\"He _was_,\" replied he, with the same calm gravity as before; \"but do\nnot wrong me by supposing that I could continue my friendship and\nesteem to a man who could so infamously, so impiously forsake and\ninjure one so transcendently\u2014well, I won't speak of it. But tell me, do\nyou never think of revenge?\"\n\"Revenge! No\u2014what good would that do?\u2014it would make him no better, and\nme no happier.\"\n\"I don't know how to talk to you, Mrs. Huntingdon,\" said he, smiling;\n\"you are only half a woman\u2014your nature must be half human, half\nangelic. Such goodness overawes me; I don't know what to make of it.\"\n\"Then, sir, I fear you must be very much worse than you should be, if\nI, a mere ordinary mortal, am, by your own confession, so vastly your\nsuperior; and since there exists so little sympathy between us, I think\nwe had better each look out for some more congenial companion.\" And\nforthwith moving to the window, I began to look out for my little son\nand his gay young friend.\n\"No, _I_ am the ordinary mortal, I maintain,\" replied Mr. Hargrave. \"I\nwill not allow myself to be worse than my fellows; but _you_, Madam\u2014I\nequally maintain there is nobody like you. But are you happy?\" he asked\nin a serious tone.\n\"As happy as some others, I suppose.\"\n\"Are you as happy as you desire to be?\"\n\"No one is so blest as that comes to on this side of eternity.\"\n\"One thing I know,\" returned he, with a deep sad sigh; \"you are\nimmeasurably happier than I am.\"\n\"I am very sorry for you, then,\" I could not help replying.\n\"Are you, _indeed?_ No, for if you were you would be glad to relieve\nme.\"\n\"And so I should if I could do so without injuring myself or any\nother.\"\n\"And can you suppose that I should wish you to injure yourself? No: on\nthe contrary, it is your own happiness I long for more than mine. You\nare miserable now, Mrs. Huntingdon,\" continued he, looking me boldly in\nthe face. \"You do not complain, but I see\u2014and feel\u2014and know that you\nare miserable\u2014and must remain so as long as you keep those walls of\nimpenetrable ice about your still warm and palpitating heart; and I am\nmiserable, too. Deign to smile on me and I am happy: trust me, and you\nshall be happy also, for if you _are_ a woman I can make you so\u2014and I\n_will_ do it in spite of yourself!\" he muttered between his teeth; \"and\nas for others, the question is between ourselves alone: you cannot\ninjure your husband, you know, and no one else has any concern in the\nmatter.\"\n\"I have a son, Mr. Hargrave, and you have a mother,\" said I, retiring\nfrom the window, whither he had followed me.\n\"They need not know,\" he began; but before anything more could be said\non either side, Esther and Arthur re-entered the room. The former\nglanced at Walter's flushed, excited countenance, and then at mine\u2014a\nlittle flushed and excited too, I daresay, though from far different\ncauses. She must have thought we had been quarrelling desperately, and\nwas evidently perplexed and disturbed at the circumstance; but she was\ntoo polite or too much afraid of her brother's anger to refer to it.\nShe seated herself on the sofa, and putting back her bright, golden\nringlets, that were scattered in wild profusion over her face, she\nimmediately began to talk about the garden and her little playfellow,\nand continued to chatter away in her usual strain till her brother\nsummoned her to depart.\n\"If I have spoken too warmly, forgive me,\" he murmured on taking his\nleave, \"or I shall never forgive myself.\" Esther smiled and glanced at\nme: I merely bowed, and her countenance fell. She thought it a poor\nreturn for Walter's generous concession, and was disappointed in her\nfriend. Poor child, she little knows the world she lives in!",

            "text": "Mr. Hargrave had not an opportunity of meeting me again in private for\nseveral weeks after this; but when he did meet me there was less of\npride and more of touching melancholy in his manner than before. Oh,\n_how_ he annoyed me! I was obliged at last almost entirely to remit my\nvisits to the Grove, at the expense of deeply offending Mrs. Hargrave\nand seriously afflicting poor Esther, who really values my society for\nwant of better, and who ought not to suffer for the fault of her\nbrother. But that indefatigable foe was not yet vanquished: he seemed\nto be always on the watch. I frequently saw him riding lingeringly past\nthe premises, looking searchingly round him as he went\u2014or, if _I_ did\nnot, Rachel did. That sharp-sighted woman soon guessed how matters\nstood between us, and descrying the enemy's movements from her\nelevation at the nursery-window, she would give me a quiet intimation\nif she saw me preparing for a walk when she had reason to believe he\nwas about, or to think it likely that he would meet or overtake me in\nthe way I meant to traverse. I would then defer my ramble, or confine\nmyself for that day to the park and gardens, or, if the proposed\nexcursion was a matter of importance, such as a visit to the sick or\nafflicted, I would take Rachel with me, and then I was never molested.\nBut one mild, sunshiny day, early in November, I had ventured forth\nalone to visit the village school and a few of the poor tenants, and on\nmy return I was alarmed at the clatter of a horse's feet behind me,\napproaching at a rapid, steady trot. There was no stile or gap at hand\nby which I could escape into the fields, so I walked quietly on, saying\nto myself, \"It may not be he after all; and if it is, and if he _do_\nannoy me, it shall be for the last time, I am determined, if there be\npower in words and looks against cool impudence and mawkish\nsentimentality so inexhaustible as his.\"\nThe horse soon overtook me, and was reined up close beside me. It _was_\nMr. Hargrave. He greeted me with a smile intended to be soft and\nmelancholy, but his triumphant satisfaction at having caught me at last\nso shone through that it was quite a failure. After briefly answering\nhis salutation and inquiring after the ladies at the Grove, I turned\naway and walked on; but he followed and kept his horse at my side: it\nwas evident he intended to be my companion all the way.\n\"Well! I don't much care. If you want another rebuff, take it\u2014and\nwelcome,\" was my inward remark. \"Now, sir, what next?\"\nThis question, though unspoken, was not long unanswered; after a few\npassing observations upon indifferent subjects, he began in solemn\ntones the following appeal to my humanity:\u2014\n\"It will be four years next April since I first saw you, Mrs.\nHuntingdon\u2014_you_ may have forgotten the circumstance, but _I_ never\ncan. I admired you then most deeply, but I dared not love you. In the\nfollowing autumn I saw so much of your perfections that I could not\nfail to love you, though I dared not show it. For upwards of three\nyears I have endured a perfect martyrdom. From the anguish of\nsuppressed emotions, intense and fruitless longings, silent sorrow,\ncrushed hopes, and trampled affections, I have suffered more than I can\ntell, or you imagine\u2014and you were the cause of it, and not altogether\nthe innocent cause. My youth is wasting away; my prospects are\ndarkened; my life is a desolate blank; I have no rest day or night: I\nam become a burden to myself and others, and you might save me by a\nword\u2014a glance, and will not do it\u2014is this right?\"\n\"In the first place, _I_ don't believe _you_,\" answered I; \"in the\nsecond, if you will be such a fool, I can't hinder it.\"\n\"If you affect,\" replied he, earnestly, \"to regard as folly the best,\nthe strongest, the most godlike impulses of our nature, I don't believe\nyou. I know you are not the heartless, icy being you pretend to be\u2014you\nhad a heart once, and gave it to your husband. When you found him\nutterly unworthy of the treasure, you reclaimed it; and you will not\n_pretend_ that you loved that sensual, earthly-minded profligate so\ndeeply, so devotedly, that you can never love another? I know that\nthere are feelings in your nature that have never yet been called\nforth; I know, too, that in your present neglected lonely state you are\nand _must_ be miserable. You have it in your power to raise two human\nbeings from a state of actual suffering to such unspeakable beatitude\nas only generous, noble, self-forgetting love can give (for you _can_\nlove me if you will); you may tell me that you scorn and detest me,\nbut, since you have set me the example of plain speaking, I will answer\nthat _I do not believe you!_ But you will not do it! you choose rather\nto leave us miserable; and you coolly tell me it is the will of God\nthat we should remain so. _You_ may call this religion, but _I_ call it\nwild fanaticism!\"\n\"There is another life both for you and for me,\" said I. \"If it be the\nwill of God that we should sow in tears now, it is only that we may\nreap in joy hereafter. It is His will that we should not injure others\nby the gratification of our own earthly passions; and you have a\nmother, and sisters, and friends who would be seriously injured by your\ndisgrace; and I, too, have friends, whose peace of mind shall never be\nsacrificed to my enjoyment, or yours either, with my consent; and if I\nwere alone in the world, I have still my God and my religion, and I\nwould sooner die than disgrace my calling and break my faith with\nheaven to obtain a few brief years of false and fleeting\nhappiness\u2014happiness sure to end in misery even here\u2014for myself or any\nother!\"\n\"There need be no disgrace, no misery or sacrifice in any quarter,\"\npersisted he. \"I do not ask you to leave your home or defy the world's\nopinion.\" But I need not repeat all his arguments. I refuted them to\nthe best of my power; but that power was provokingly small, at the\nmoment, for I was too much flurried with indignation\u2014and even\nshame\u2014that he should thus dare to address me, to retain sufficient\ncommand of thought and language to enable me adequately to contend\nagainst his powerful sophistries. Finding, however, that he could not\nbe silenced by reason, and even covertly exulted in his seeming\nadvantage, and ventured to deride those assertions I had not the\ncoolness to prove, I changed my course and tried another plan.\n\"Do you really love me?\" said I, seriously, pausing and looking him\ncalmly in the face.\n\"Do I love you!\" cried he.\n\"_Truly?_\" I demanded.\nHis countenance brightened; he thought his triumph was at hand. He\ncommenced a passionate protestation of the truth and fervour of his\nattachment, which I cut short by another question:\u2014\n\"But is it not a selfish love? Have you enough disinterested affection\nto enable you to sacrifice your own pleasure to mine?\"\n\"I would give my life to serve you.\"\n\"I don't want your life; but have you enough real sympathy for my\nafflictions to induce you to make an effort to relieve them, at the\nrisk of a little discomfort to yourself?\"\n\"Try me, and see.\"\n\"If you have, _never mention this subject again_. You cannot recur to\nit in any way without doubling the weight of those sufferings you so\nfeelingly deplore. I have nothing left me but the solace of a good\nconscience and a hopeful trust in heaven, and you labour continually to\nrob me of these. If you persist, I must regard you as my deadliest\nfoe.\"\n\"But hear me a moment\u2014\"\n\"No, sir! You said you would give your life to serve me; I only ask\nyour _silence_ on one particular point. I have spoken plainly; and what\nI say I mean. If you torment me in this way any more, I must conclude\nthat your protestations are entirely false, and that you hate me in\nyour heart as fervently as you profess to love me!\"\nHe bit his lip, and bent his eyes upon the ground in silence for a\nwhile.\n\"Then I must leave you,\" said he at length, looking steadily upon me,\nas if with the last hope of detecting some token of irrepressible\nanguish or dismay awakened by those solemn words. \"I must leave you. I\ncannot live here, and be for ever silent on the all-absorbing subject\nof my thoughts and wishes.\"\n\"Formerly, I believe, you spent but little of your time at home,\" I\nanswered; \"it will do you no harm to absent yourself again, for a\nwhile\u2014if that be really necessary.\"\n\"If that be really _possible_,\" he muttered; \"and can you bid me go so\ncoolly? Do you really wish it?\"\n\"Most certainly I do. If you cannot see me without tormenting me as you\nhave lately done, I would gladly say farewell and never see you more.\"\nHe made no answer, but, bending from his horse, held out his hand\ntowards me. I looked up at his face, and saw therein such a look of\ngenuine agony of soul, that, whether bitter disappointment, or wounded\npride, or lingering love, or burning wrath were uppermost, I could not\nhesitate to put my hand in his as frankly as if I bade a friend\nfarewell. He grasped it very hard, and immediately put spurs to his\nhorse and galloped away. Very soon after, I learned that he was gone to\nParis, where he still is; and the longer he stays there the better for\nme.",

Well then,\u2014\"\n\"No!\" exclaimed his lordship, with deep, determined emphasis. \"Though I\nhate him from my heart, and should rejoice at any calamity that could\nbefall him, I'll leave him to God; and though I abhor my own life, I'll\nleave that, too, to Him that gave it.\"\n\"But you see, in this case,\" pleaded Hattersley\u2014\n\"I'll not hear you!\" exclaimed his companion, hastily turning away.\n\"Not another word! I've enough to do against the fiend within me.\"\n\"Then you're a white-livered fool, and I wash my hands of you,\"\ngrumbled the tempter, as he swung himself round and departed.",

In the ante-room was Mr.\nHattersley, railing against Lord Lowborough's poltroonery before a\nselect audience, viz. Mr. Huntingdon, who was lounging against the\ntable, exulting in his own treacherous villainy, and laughing his\nvictim to scorn, and Mr. Grimsby, standing by, quietly rubbing his\nhands and chuckling with fiendish satisfaction.\nIn the drawing-room I found Lady Lowborough, evidently in no very\nenviable state of mind, and struggling hard to conceal her discomposure\nby an overstrained affectation of unusual cheerfulness and vivacity,\nvery uncalled-for under the circumstances, for she had herself given\nthe company to understand that her husband had received unpleasant\nintelligence from home, which necessitated his immediate departure, and\nthat he had suffered it so to bother his mind that it had brought on a\nbilious headache, owing to which, and the preparations he judged\nnecessary to hasten his departure, she believed they would not have the\npleasure of seeing him to-night. However, she asserted, it was only a\nbusiness concern, and so she did not intend it should trouble _her._\nShe was just saying this as I entered, and she darted upon me such a\nglance of hardihood and defiance as at once astonished and revolted me.\n\"But I _am_ troubled,\" continued she, \"and vexed too, for I think it my\nduty to accompany his lordship, and of course I am very sorry to part\nwith all my kind friends so unexpectedly and so soon.\"\n\"And yet, Annabella,\" said Esther, who was sitting beside her, \"I never\nsaw you in better spirits in my life.\"\n\"Precisely so, my love: because I wish to make the best of your\nsociety, since it appears this is to be the last night I am to enjoy it\ntill heaven knows when; and I wish to leave a good impression on you\nall,\"\u2014she glanced round, and seeing her aunt's eye fixed upon her,\nrather too scrutinizingly, as she probably thought, she started up and\ncontinued: \"To which end I'll give you a song\u2014shall I, aunt? shall I,\nMrs. Huntingdon? shall I ladies and gentlemen all? Very well. I'll do\nmy best to amuse you.\"\nShe and Lord Lowborough occupied the apartments next to mine. I know\nnot how _she_ passed the night, but I lay awake the greater part of it\nlistening to his heavy step pacing monotonously up and down his\ndressing-room, which was nearest my chamber. Once I heard him pause and\nthrow something out of the window with a passionate ejaculation; and in\nthe morning, after they were gone, a keen-bladed clasp-knife was found\non the grass-plot below; a razor, likewise, was snapped in two and\nthrust deep into the cinders of the grate, but partially corroded by\nthe decaying embers. So strong had been the temptation to end his\nmiserable life, so determined his resolution to resist it.\nMy heart bled for him as I lay listening to that ceaseless tread.\nHitherto I had thought too much of myself, too little of him: now I\nforgot my own afflictions, and thought only of his; of the ardent\naffection so miserably wasted, the fond faith so cruelly betrayed,\nthe\u2014no, I will not attempt to enumerate his wrongs\u2014but I hated his wife\nand my husband more intensely than ever, and not for my sake, but for",

I first attempted to keep him always\nwith me, or in the nursery, and gave Rachel particular injunctions\nnever to let him come down to dessert as long as these \"gentlemen\"\nstayed; but it was no use: these orders were immediately countermanded\nand overruled by his father; he was not going to have the little fellow\nmoped to death between an old nurse and a cursed fool of a mother. So\nthe little fellow came down every evening in spite of his cross mamma,\nand learned to tipple wine like papa, to swear like Mr. Hattersley, and\nto have his own way like a man, and sent mamma to the devil when she\ntried to prevent him. To see such things done with the roguish na\u00efvet\u00e9\nof that pretty little child, and hear such things spoken by that small\ninfantile voice, was as peculiarly piquant and irresistibly droll to\nthem as it was inexpressibly distressing and painful to me; and when he\nhad set the table in a roar he would look round delightedly upon them\nall, and add his shrill laugh to theirs.

God has\ndesigned me to be your comfort and protector\u2014I feel it, I know it as\ncertainly as if a voice from heaven declared, 'Ye twain shall be one\nflesh'\u2014and you spurn me from you\u2014\"\n\"Let me go, Mr. Hargrave!\" said I, sternly. But he only tightened his\ngrasp.\n\"Let me go!\" I repeated, quivering with indignation.\nHis face was almost opposite the window as he knelt. With a slight\nstart, I saw him glance towards it; and then a gleam of malicious\ntriumph lit up his countenance. Looking over my shoulder, I beheld a\nshadow just retiring round the corner.\n\"That is Grimsby,\" said he deliberately. \"He will report what he has\nseen to Huntingdon and all the rest, with such embellishments as he\nthinks proper. He has no love for you, Mrs. Huntingdon\u2014no reverence for\nyour sex, no belief in virtue, no admiration for its image. He will\ngive such a version of this story as will leave no doubt at all about\nyour character, in the minds of those who hear it. Your fair fame is\ngone; and nothing that I or you can say can ever retrieve it. But give\nme the power to protect you, and show me the villain that dares to\ninsult!\"\n\"No one has ever dared to insult me as you are doing now!\" said I, at\nlength releasing my hands, and recoiling from him.\n\"I do not insult you,\" cried he: \"I worship you. You are my angel, my\ndivinity! I lay my powers at your feet, and you must and shall accept\nthem!\" he exclaimed, impetuously starting to his feet. \"I _will_ be\nyour consoler and defender! and if your conscience upbraid you for it,\nsay I overcame you, and you could not choose but yield!\"\nI never saw a man go terribly excited. He precipitated himself towards\nme. I snatched up my palette-knife and held it against him. This\nstartled him: he stood and gazed at me in astonishment; I daresay I\nlooked as fierce and resolute as he. I moved to the bell, and put my\nhand upon the cord. This tamed him still more. With a\nhalf-authoritative, half-deprecating wave of the hand, he sought to\ndeter me from ringing.\n\"Stand off, then!\" said I; he stepped back. \"And listen to me. I don't\nlike you,\" I continued, as deliberately and emphatically as I could, to\ngive the greater efficacy to my words; \"and if I were divorced from my\nhusband, or if he were dead, I would not marry you. There now! I hope\nyou're satisfied.\"\nHis face grew blanched with anger.\n\"I _am_ satisfied,\" he replied, with bitter emphasis, \"that you are the\nmost cold-hearted, unnatural, ungrateful woman I ever yet beheld!\"\n\"Ungrateful, sir?\"\n\"Ungrateful.\"\n\"No, Mr. Hargrave, I am not. For all the good you ever did me, or ever\nwished to do, I most sincerely thank you: for all the evil you have\ndone me, and all you would have done, I pray God to pardon you, and\nmake you of a better mind.\"\nHere the door was thrown open, and Messrs. Huntingdon and Hattersley\nappeared without. The latter remained in the hall, busy with his ramrod\nand his gun; the former walked in, and stood with his back to the fire,\nsurveying Mr. Hargrave and me, particularly the former, with a smile of\ninsupportable meaning, accompanied as it was by the impudence of his\nbrazen brow, and the sly, malicious, twinkle of his eye.\n\"Well, sir?\" said Hargrave, interrogatively, and with the air of one\nprepared to stand on the defensive.\n\"Well, sir,\" returned his host.\n\"We want to know if you are at liberty to join us in a go at the\npheasants, Walter,\" interposed Hattersley from without. \"Come! there\nshall be nothing shot besides, except a puss or two; _I'll_ vouch for\nthat.\"\nWalter did not answer, but walked to the window to collect his\nfaculties. Arthur uttered a low whistle, and followed him with his\neyes. A slight flush of anger rose to Hargrave's cheek; but in a moment\nhe turned calmly round, and said carelessly:\n\"I came here to bid farewell to Mrs. Huntingdon, and tell her I must go\nto-morrow.\"\n\"Humph! You're mighty sudden in your resolution. What takes you off so\nsoon, may I ask?\"\n\"Business,\" returned he, repelling the other's incredulous sneer with a\nglance of scornful defiance.\n\"Very good,\" was the reply; and Hargrave walked away. Thereupon Mr.\nHuntingdon, gathering his coat-laps under his arms, and setting his\nshoulder against the mantel-piece, turned to me, and, addressing me in\na low voice, scarcely above his breath, poured forth a volley of the\nvilest and grossest abuse it was possible for the imagination to\nconceive or the tongue to utter. I did not attempt to interrupt him;\nbut my spirit kindled within me, and when he had done, I replied, \"If\nyour accusation were true, Mr. Huntingdon, how _dare you_ blame me?\"\n\"She's hit it, by Jove!\" cried Hattersley, rearing his gun against the\nwall; and, stepping into the room, he took his precious friend by the\narm, and attempted to drag him away. \"Come, my lad,\" he muttered; \"true\nor false, _you've_ no right to blame her, you _know_, nor him either;\nafter what you said last night. So come along.\"\nThere was something implied here that I could not endure.\n\"Dare you suspect me, Mr. Hattersley?\" said I, almost beside myself\nwith fury.\n\"Nay, nay, I suspect nobody. It's all right, it's all right. So come\nalong, Huntingdon, you blackguard.\"\n\"She can't deny it!\" cried the gentleman thus addressed, grinning in\nmingled rage and triumph. \"She can't deny it if her life depended on\nit!\" and muttering some more abusive language, he walked into the hall,\nand took up his hat and gun from the table.\n\"I scorn to justify myself to you!\" said I. \"But you,\" turning to\nHattersley, \"if you presume to have any doubts on the subject, ask Mr.\nHargrave.\"\nAt this they simultaneously burst into a rude laugh that made my whole\nframe tingle to the fingers' ends.\n\"Where is he? I'll ask him myself!\" said I, advancing towards them.\nSuppressing a new burst of merriment, Hattersley pointed to the outer\ndoor. It was half open. His brother-in-law was standing on the front\nwithout.\n\"Mr. Hargrave, will you please to step this way?\" said I.\nHe turned and looked at me in grave surprise.\n\"Step this way, if you please!\" I repeated, in so determined a manner\nthat he could not, or did not choose to resist its authority. Somewhat\nreluctantly he ascended the steps and advanced a pace or two into the\nhall.\n\"And tell those gentlemen,\" I continued\u2014\"these men, whether or not I\nyielded to your solicitations.\"\n\"I don't understand you, Mrs. Huntingdon.\"\n\"You _do_ understand me, sir; and I charge you, upon your honour as a\ngentleman (if you have any), to answer truly. Did I, or did I not?\"\n\"No,\" muttered he, turning away.\n\"Speak up, sir; they can't hear you. Did I grant your request?\n\"You did not.\"\n\"No, I'll be sworn she didn't,\" said Hattersley, \"or he'd never look so\nblack.\"\n\"I'm willing to grant you the satisfaction of a gentleman, Huntingdon,\"\nsaid Mr. Hargrave, calmly addressing his host, but with a bitter sneer\nupon his countenance.\n\"Go to the deuce!\" replied the latter, with an impatient jerk of the\nhead. Hargrave withdrew with a look of cold disdain, saying,\u2014\"You know\nwhere to find me, should you feel disposed to send a friend.\"\nMuttered oaths and curses were all the answer this intimation obtained.\n\"Now, Huntingdon, you see!\" said Hattersley. \"Clear as the day.\"\n\"I don't care _what_ he sees,\" said I, \"or what he imagines; but you,\nMr. Hattersley, when you hear my name belied and slandered, will you\ndefend it?\"\n\"I will.\"\nI instantly departed and shut myself into the library. What could\npossess me to make such a request of such a man I cannot tell; but\ndrowning men catch at straws: they had driven me desperate between\nthem; I hardly knew what I said. There was no other to preserve my name\nfrom being blackened and aspersed among this nest of boon companions,\nand through them, perhaps, into the world; and beside my abandoned\nwretch of a husband, the base, malignant Grimsby, and the false villain\nHargrave, this boorish ruffian, coarse and brutal as he was, shone like\na glow-worm in the dark, among its fellow worms.\nWhat a scene was this! Could I ever have imagined that I should be\ndoomed to bear such insults under my own roof\u2014to hear such things\nspoken in my presence; nay, spoken _to_ me and _of_ me; and by those\nwho arrogated to themselves the name of gentlemen? And could I have\nimagined that I should have been able to endure it as calmly, and to\nrepel their insults as firmly and as boldly as I had done? A hardness\nsuch as this is taught by rough experience and despair alone.\nSuch thoughts as these chased one another through my mind, as I paced\nto and fro the room, and longed\u2014oh, _how_ I longed\u2014to take my child and\nleave them now, without an hour's delay! But it could not be; there was\nwork before me: hard work, that must be done.\n\"Then let me do it,\" said I, \"and lose not a moment in vain repinings\nand idle chafings against my fate, and those who influence it.\"\nAnd conquering my agitation with a powerful effort, I immediately\nresumed my task, and laboured hard all day.\nMr. Hargrave did depart on the morrow; and I have never seen him since.",

I soon\nacquainted Rachel with my design, confiding all my motives and\nintentions to her ear, and, much to my agreeable surprise, found little\ndifficulty in persuading her to enter into my views. She is a sober,\ncautious woman, but she so hates her master, and so loves her mistress\nand her nursling, that after several ejaculations, a few faint\nobjections, and many tears and lamentations that I should be brought to\nsuch a pass, she applauded my resolution and consented to aid me with\nall her might: on one condition only: that she might share my exile:\notherwise, she was utterly inexorable, regarding it as perfect madness\nfor me and Arthur to go alone. With touching generosity, she modestly\noffered to aid me with her little hoard of savings, hoping I would\n\"excuse her for the liberty, but really, if I would do her the favour\nto accept it as a loan, she would be very happy.\" Of course I could not\nthink of such a thing; but now, thank heaven, I have gathered a little\nhoard of my own, and my preparations are so far advanced that I am\nlooking forward to a speedy emancipation. Only let the stormy severity\nof this winter weather be somewhat abated, and then, some morning, Mr.\nHuntingdon will come down to a solitary breakfast-table, and perhaps be\nclamouring through the house for his invisible wife and child, when\nthey are some fifty miles on their way to the Western world, or it may\nbe more: for we shall leave him hours before the dawn, and it is not\nprobable he will discover the loss of both until the day is far\nadvanced.\nI am fully alive to the evils that may and must result upon the step I\nam about to take; but I never waver in my resolution, because I never\nforget my son. It was only this morning, while I pursued my usual\nemployment, he was sitting at my feet, quietly playing with the shreds\nof canvas I had thrown upon the carpet; but his mind was otherwise\noccupied, for, in a while, he looked up wistfully in my face, and\ngravely asked,\u2014\"Mamma, why are you wicked?\"\n\"Who told you I was wicked, love?\"\n\"Rachel.\"\n\"No, Arthur, Rachel never said so, I am certain.\"\n\"Well, then, it was papa,\" replied he, thoughtfully. Then, after a\nreflective pause, he added, \"At least, I'll tell you how it was I got\nto know: when I'm with papa, if I say mamma wants me, or mamma says I'm\nnot to do something that he tells me to do, he always says, 'Mamma be\ndamned,' and Rachel says it's only wicked people that are damned. So,\nmamma, that's why I think you must be wicked: and I wish you wouldn't.\"\n\"My dear child, I am not. Those are bad words, and wicked people often\nsay them of others better than themselves. Those words cannot make\npeople be damned, nor show that they deserve it. God will judge us by\nour own thoughts and deeds, not by what others say about us. And when\nyou hear such words spoken, Arthur, remember never to repeat them: it\nis wicked to say such things of others, not to have them said against\nyou.\"\n\"Then it's papa that's wicked,\" said he, ruefully.\n\"Papa is wrong to say such things, and you will be very wrong to\nimitate him now that you know better.\"\n\"What _is_ imitate?\"\n\"To do as he does.\"\n\"Does _he_ know better?\"\n\"Perhaps he does; but that is nothing to you.\"\n\"If he doesn't, you ought to tell him, mamma.\"\n\"I _have_ told him.\"\nThe little moralist paused and pondered. I tried in vain to divert his\nmind from the subject.\n\"I'm sorry papa's wicked,\" said he mournfully, at length, \"for I don't\nwant him to go to hell.\" And so saying he burst into tears.\nI consoled him with the hope that perhaps his papa would alter and\nbecome good before he died\u2014; but is it not time to deliver him from\nsuch a parent?",

He had risen, however, unknown to me,\nand, actuated by some base spirit of curiosity, been looking over my\nshoulder for I know not how long; for when I had laid aside my pen, and\nwas about to close the book, he suddenly placed his hand upon it, and\nsaying,\u2014\"With your leave, my dear, I'll have a look at this,\" forcibly\nwrested it from me, and, drawing a chair to the table, composedly sat\ndown to examine it: turning back leaf after leaf to find an explanation\nof what he had read. Unluckily for me, he was more sober that night\nthan he usually is at such an hour.\nOf course I did not leave him to pursue this occupation in quiet: I\nmade several attempts to snatch the book from his hands, but he held it\ntoo firmly for that; I upbraided him in bitterness and scorn for his\nmean and dishonourable conduct, but that had no effect upon him; and,\nfinally, I extinguished both the candles, but he only wheeled round to\nthe fire, and raising a blaze sufficient for his purposes, calmly\ncontinued the investigation. I had serious thoughts of getting a\npitcher of water and extinguishing that light too; but it was evident\nhis curiosity was too keenly excited to be quenched by that, and the\nmore I manifested my anxiety to baffle his scrutiny, the greater would\nbe his determination to persist in it, besides it was too late.\n\"It seems very interesting, love,\" said he, lifting his head and\nturning to where I stood, wringing my hands in silent rage and anguish;\n\"but it's rather long; I'll look at it some other time; and meanwhile\nI'll trouble you for your keys, my dear.\"\n\"What keys?\"\n\"The keys of your cabinet, desk, drawers, and whatever else you\npossess,\" said he, rising and holding out his hand.\n\"I've not got them,\" I replied. The key of my desk, in fact, was at\nthat moment in the lock, and the others were attached to it.\n\"Then you must send for them,\" said he; \"and if that old devil, Rachel,\ndoesn't immediately deliver them up, she tramps bag and baggage\ntomorrow.\"\n\"She doesn't know where they are,\" I answered, quietly placing my hand\nupon them, and taking them from the desk, as I thought, unobserved.\n\"_I_ know, but I shall not give them up without a reason.\"\n\"And _I_ know, too,\" said he, suddenly seizing my closed hand and\nrudely abstracting them from it. He then took up one of the candles and\nrelighted it by thrusting it into the fire.\n\"Now, then,\" sneered he, \"we must have a confiscation of property. But,\nfirst, let us take a peep into the studio.\"\nAnd putting the keys into his pocket, he walked into the library. I\nfollowed, whether with the dim idea of preventing mischief, or only to",

He was inordinately fond of them for so young a\ncreature, and, remembering my unfortunate father as well as his, I\ndreaded the consequences of such a taste. But if I had stinted him, in\nhis usual quantity of wine, or forbidden him to taste it altogether,\nthat would only have increased his partiality for it, and made him\nregard it as a greater treat than ever. I therefore gave him quite as\nmuch as his father was accustomed to allow him; as much, indeed, as he\ndesired to have\u2014but into every glass I surreptitiously introduced a\nsmall quantity of tartar-emetic, just enough to produce inevitable\nnausea and depression without positive sickness. Finding such\ndisagreeable consequences invariably to result from this indulgence, he\nsoon grew weary of it, but the more he shrank from the daily treat the\nmore I pressed it upon him, till his reluctance was strengthened to\nperfect abhorrence. When he was thoroughly disgusted with every kind of\nwine, I allowed him, at his own request, to try brandy-and-water, and\nthen gin-and-water, for the little toper was familiar with them all,\nand I was determined that all should be equally hateful to him. This I\nhave now effected; and since he declares that the taste, the smell, the\nsight of any one of them is sufficient to make him sick, I have given\nup teasing him about them, except now and then as objects of terror in\ncases of misbehaviour. \"Arthur, if you're not a good boy I shall give\nyou a glass of wine,\" or \"Now, Arthur, if you say that again you shall\nhave some brandy-and-water,\" is as good as any other threat; and once\nor twice, when he was sick, I have obliged the poor child to swallow a\nlittle wine-and-water _without_ the tartar-emetic, by way of medicine;\nand this practice I intend to continue for some time to come; not that\nI think it of any real service in a physical sense, but because I am\ndetermined to enlist all the powers of association in my service; I\nwish this aversion to be so deeply grounded in his nature that nothing\nin after-life may be able to overcome it.",

And Walter, too, is so seriously displeased at my\nperversity and absurd caprice, as he calls it, that I fear he will\nnever forgive me\u2014I did not think he _could_ be so unkind as he has\nlately shown himself. But Milicent begged me not to yield, and I'm\nsure, Mrs. Huntingdon, if you had seen the man they wanted to palm upon\nme, you would have advised me not to take him too.\"\n\"I should have done so whether I had seen him or not,\" said I; \"it is\nenough that you dislike him.\"\n\"I knew you would say so; though mamma affirmed you would be quite\nshocked at my undutiful conduct. You can't imagine how she lectures me:\nI am disobedient and ungrateful; I am thwarting her wishes, wronging my\nbrother, and making myself a burden on her hands. I sometimes fear\nshe'll overcome me after all. I have a strong will, but so has she, and\nwhen she says such bitter things, it provokes me to such a pass that I\nfeel inclined to do as she bids me, and then break my heart and say,\n'There, mamma, it's all your fault!'\"\n\"Pray don't!\" said I. \"Obedience from such a motive would be positive\nwickedness, and certain to bring the punishment it deserves. Stand\nfirm, and your mamma will soon relinquish her persecution; and the\ngentleman himself will cease to pester you with his addresses if he\nfinds them steadily rejected.\"\n\"Oh, no! mamma will weary all about her before she tires herself with\nher exertions; and as for Mr. Oldfield, she has given him to understand\nthat I have refused his offer, not from any dislike of his person, but\nmerely because I am giddy and young, and cannot at present reconcile\nmyself to the thoughts of marriage under any circumstances: but by next\nseason, she has no doubt, I shall have more sense, and hopes my girlish\nfancies will be worn away. So she has brought me home, to school me\ninto a proper sense of my duty, against the time comes round again.\nIndeed, I believe she will not put herself to the expense of taking me\nup to London again, unless I surrender: she cannot afford to take me to\ntown for pleasure and nonsense, she says, and it is not _every_ rich\ngentleman that will consent to take me without a fortune, whatever\nexalted ideas I may have of my own attractions.\"\n\"Well, Esther, I pity you; but still, I repeat, stand firm. You might\nas well sell yourself to slavery at once, as marry a man you dislike.\nIf your mother and brother are unkind to you, you may leave them, but\nremember you are bound to your husband for life.\"\n\"But I cannot leave them unless I get married, and I cannot get married\nif nobody sees me. I saw one or two gentlemen in London that I might\nhave liked, but they were younger sons, and mamma would not let me get\nto know them\u2014one especially, who I believe rather liked me\u2014but she\nthrew every possible obstacle in the way of our better acquaintance.\nWasn't it provoking?\"\n\"I have no doubt you would feel it so, but it is possible that if you\nmarried him, you might have more reason to regret it hereafter than if\nyou married Mr. Oldfield. When I tell you not to marry _without_ love,\nI do not advise you to marry for love alone: there are many, many other\nthings to be considered. Keep both heart and hand in your own\npossession, till you see good reason to part with them; and if such an\noccasion should never present itself, comfort your mind with this\nreflection, that though in single life your joys may not be very many,\nyour sorrows, at least, will not be more than you can bear. Marriage\n_may_ change your circumstances for the better, but, in my private\nopinion, it is far more likely to produce a contrary result.\"\n\"So thinks Milicent; but allow me to say _I_ think otherwise. If I\nthought myself doomed to old-maidenhood, I should cease to value my\nlife. The thoughts of living on, year after year, at the Grove\u2014a\nhanger-on upon mamma and Walter, a mere cumberer of the ground (now\nthat I know in what light they would regard it), is perfectly\nintolerable; I would rather run away with the butler.\"\n\"Your circumstances are peculiar, I allow; but have patience, love; do\nnothing rashly. Remember you are not yet nineteen, and many years are\nyet to pass before any one can set you down as an old maid: you cannot\ntell what Providence may have in store for you. And meantime, remember\nyou have a _right_ to the protection and support of your mother and\nbrother, however they may seem to grudge it.\"\n\"You are so grave, Mrs. Huntingdon,\" said Esther, after a pause. \"When",

I sought out and put into his hands\ntwo of Milicent's letters: one dated from London, and written during\none of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation; the other in the\ncountry, during a lucid interval. The former was full of trouble and\nanguish; not accusing _him_, but deeply regretting his connection with\nhis profligate companions, abusing Mr. Grimsby and others, insinuating\nbitter things against Mr. Huntingdon, and most ingeniously throwing the\nblame of her husband's misconduct on to other men's shoulders. The\nlatter was full of hope and joy, yet with a trembling consciousness\nthat this happiness would not last; praising his goodness to the skies,\nbut with an evident, though but half-expressed wish, that it were based\non a surer foundation than the natural impulses of the heart, and a\nhalf-prophetic dread of the fall of that house so founded on the\nsand,\u2014which fall had shortly after taken place, as Hattersley must have\nbeen conscious while he read.\nAlmost at the commencement of the first letter I had the unexpected\npleasure of seeing him blush; but he immediately turned his back to me,\nand finished the perusal at the window. At the second, I saw him, once\nor twice, raise his hand, and hurriedly pass it across his face. Could\nit be to dash away a tear? When he had done, there was an interval\nspent in clearing his throat and staring out of the window, and then,\nafter whistling a few bars of a favourite air, he turned round, gave me\nback the letters, and silently shook me by the hand.",

And poor Rachel, too,\ncame in for her share of abuse, as usual; he cannot endure Rachel,\nbecause he knows she has a proper appreciation of him.\nI calmly defended our several qualifications as nurse and governess,\nand still resisted the proposed addition to our family; but he cut me\nshort by saying it was no use bothering about the matter, for he had\nengaged a governess already, and she was coming next week; so that all\nI had to do was to get things ready for her reception. This was a\nrather startling piece of intelligence. I ventured to inquire her name\nand address, by whom she had been recommended, or how he had been led\nto make choice of her.\n\"She is a very estimable, pious young person,\" said he; \"you needn't be\nafraid. Her name is Myers, I believe; and she was recommended to me by\na respectable old dowager: a lady of high repute in the religious\nworld. I have not seen her myself, and therefore cannot give you a\nparticular account of her person and conversation, and so forth; but,\nif the old lady's eulogies are correct, you will find her to possess\nall desirable qualifications for her position: an inordinate love of\nchildren among the rest.\"\nAll this was gravely and quietly spoken, but there was a laughing demon\nin his half-averted eye that boded no good, I imagined.

While she\ndressed me I explained to her my intentions and what assistance I\nshould require from her, and told her which of my things she was to\npack up, and what she was to leave behind for herself, as I had no\nother means of recompensing her for this sudden dismissal after her\nlong and faithful service: a circumstance I most deeply regretted, but\ncould not avoid.\n\"And what will you do, Rachel?\" said I; \"will you go home, or seek\nanother place?\"\n\"I have no home, ma'am, but with you,\" she replied; \"and if I leave you\nI'll never go into place again as long as I live.\"\n\"But I can't afford to live like a lady now,\" returned I: \"I must be my\nown maid and my child's nurse.\"\n\"What _signifies!_\" replied she, in some excitement. \"You'll want\nsomebody to clean and wash, and cook, won't you? I can do all that; and\nnever mind the wages: I've my bits o' savings yet, and if you wouldn't\ntake me I should have to find my own board and lodging out of 'em\nsomewhere, or else work among strangers: and it's what I'm not used to:\nso you can please yourself, ma'am.\" Her voice quavered as she spoke,\nand the tears stood in her eyes.\n\"I should like it above all things, Rachel, and I'd give you such wages\nas I could afford: such as I should give to any servant-of-all-work I\nmight employ: but don't you see I should be dragging you down with me\nwhen you have done nothing to deserve it?\"\n\"Oh, fiddle!\" ejaculated she.\n\"And, besides, my future way of living will be so widely different to\nthe past: so different to all you have been accustomed to\u2014\"\n\"Do you think, ma'am, I can't bear what my missis can? surely I'm not\nso proud and so dainty as that comes to; and my little master, too, God\nbless him!\"\n\"But I'm young, Rachel; I sha'n't mind it; and Arthur is young too: it\nwill be nothing to him.\"\n\"Nor me either: I'm not so old but what I can stand hard fare and hard\nwork, if it's only to help and comfort them as I've loved like my own\nbairns: for all I'm too old to bide the thoughts o' leaving 'em in\ntrouble and danger, and going amongst strangers myself.\"\n\"Then you sha'n't, Rachel!\" cried I, embracing my faithful friend.\n\"We'll all go together, and you shall see how the new life suits you.\"\n\"Bless you, honey!\" cried she, affectionately returning my embrace.\n\"Only let us get shut of this wicked house, and we'll do right enough,\nyou'll see.\"\n\"So think I,\" was my answer; and so that point was settled.",

I then gave her his address, exhorted her to write frequently,\nreiterated some of my former admonitions regarding her own concerns,\nand bade her a fond farewell.\nThe second was to Milicent; much to the same effect, but a little more\nconfidential, as befitted our longer intimacy, and her greater\nexperience and better acquaintance with my circumstances.\nThe third was to my aunt: a much more difficult and painful\nundertaking, and therefore I had left it to the last; but I must give\nher some explanation of that extraordinary step I had taken: and that\nquickly, for she and my uncle would no doubt hear of it within a day or\ntwo after my disappearance, as it was probable that Mr. Huntingdon\nwould speedily apply to them to know what was become of me. At last,\nhowever, I told her I was sensible of my error: I did not complain of\nits punishment, and I was sorry to trouble my friends with its\nconsequences; but in duty to my son I must submit no longer; it was\nabsolutely necessary that he should be delivered from his father's\ncorrupting influence. I should not disclose my place of refuge even to\nher, in order that she and my uncle might be able, with truth, to deny\nall knowledge concerning it; but any communications addressed to me\nunder cover to my brother would be certain to reach me. I hoped she and\nmy uncle would pardon the step I had taken, for if they knew all, I was\nsure they would not blame me; and I trusted they would not afflict\nthemselves on my account, for if I could only reach my retreat in\nsafety and keep it unmolested, I should be very happy, but for the\nthoughts of them; and should be quite contented to spend my life in\nobscurity, devoting myself to the training up of my child, and teaching\nhim to avoid the errors of both his parents.\nThese things were done yesterday: I have given two whole days to the\npreparation for our departure, that Frederick may have more time to\nprepare the rooms, and Rachel to pack up the things: for the latter\ntask must be done with the utmost caution and secrecy, and there is no\none but me to assist her. I can help to get the articles together, but\nI do not understand the art of stowing them into the boxes, so as to\ntake up the smallest possible space; and there are her own things to\ndo, as well as mine and Arthur's. I can ill afford to leave anything\nbehind, since I have no money, except a few guineas in my purse; and\nbesides, as Rachel observed, whatever I left would most likely become\nthe property of Miss Myers, and I should not relish that.",

But shall we escape in safety?\nOh, that the morning were come, and we were on our way at least! This\nevening, when I had given Rachel all the assistance I could, and had\nnothing left me but to wait, and wish and tremble, I became so greatly\nagitated that I knew not what to do. I went down to dinner, but I could\nnot force myself to eat. Mr. Huntingdon remarked the circumstance.\n\"What's to do with you _now?_\" said he, when the removal of the second\ncourse gave him time to look about him.\n\"I am not well,\" I replied: \"I think I must lie down a little; you\nwon't miss me much?\"\n\"Not the least: if you leave your chair, it'll do just as well\u2014better,\na trifle,\" he muttered, as I left the room, \"for I can fancy somebody\nelse fills it.\"\n\"Somebody else _may_ fill it to-morrow,\" I thought, but did not say.\n\"There! I've seen the last of _you_, I hope,\" I muttered, as I closed\nthe door upon him.\nRachel urged me to seek repose at once, to recruit my strength for\nto-morrow's journey, as we must be gone before the dawn; but in my\npresent state of nervous excitement that was entirely out of the\nquestion. It was equally out of the question to sit, or wander about my\nroom, counting the hours and the minutes between me and the appointed\ntime of action, straining my ears and trembling at every sound, lest\nsomeone should discover and betray us after all. I took up a book and\ntried to read: my eyes wandered over the pages, but it was impossible\nto bind my thoughts to their contents. Why not have recourse to the old\nexpedient, and add this last event to my chronicle? I opened its pages\nonce more, and wrote the above account\u2014with difficulty, at first, but\ngradually my mind became more calm and steady. Thus several hours have\npassed away: the time is drawing near; and now my eyes feel heavy and\nmy frame exhausted. I will commend my cause to God, and then lie down\nand gain an hour or two of sleep; and _then!_\u2014\nLittle Arthur sleeps soundly. All the house is still: there can be no\none watching. The boxes were all corded by Benson, and quietly conveyed\ndown the back stairs after dusk, and sent away in a cart to the M\u2014\u2014\ncoach-office. The name upon the cards was Mrs. Graham, which\nappellation I mean henceforth to adopt. My mother's maiden name was\nGraham, and therefore I fancy I have some claim to it, and prefer it to\nany other, except my own, which I dare not resume.",

Early we rose,\nswiftly and quietly dressed, slowly and stealthily descended to the\nhall, where Benson stood ready with a light, to open the door and\nfasten it after us. We were obliged to let one man into our secret on\naccount of the boxes, &c. All the servants were but too well acquainted\nwith their master's conduct, and either Benson or John would have been\nwilling to serve me; but as the former was more staid and elderly, and\na crony of Rachel's besides, I of course directed her to make choice of\nhim as her assistant and confidant on the occasion, as far as necessity\ndemanded, I only hope he may not be brought into trouble thereby, and\nonly wish I could reward him for the perilous service he was so ready\nto undertake. I slipped two guineas into his hand, by way of\nremembrance, as he stood in the doorway, holding the candle to light\nour departure, with a tear in his honest grey eye, and a host of good\nwishes depicted on his solemn countenance. Alas! I could offer no more:\nI had barely sufficient remaining for the probable expenses of the\njourney.\nWhat trembling joy it was when the little wicket closed behind us, as\nwe issued from the park! Then, for one moment, I paused, to inhale one\ndraught of that cool, bracing air, and venture one look back upon the\nhouse. All was dark and still: no light glimmered in the windows, no\nwreath of smoke obscured the stars that sparkled above it in the frosty\nsky. As I bade farewell for ever to that place, the scene of so much\nguilt and misery, I felt glad that I had not left it before, for now\nthere was no doubt about the propriety of such a step\u2014no shadow of\nremorse for him I left behind.

The lane conducted us\nround by the back way. We entered the desolate court, and in breathless\nanxiety surveyed the ruinous mass. Was it all blackness and desolation?\nNo; one faint red glimmer cheered us from a window where the lattice\nwas in good repair. The door was fastened, but after due knocking and\nwaiting, and some parleying with a voice from an upper window, we were\nadmitted by an old woman who had been commissioned to air and keep the\nhouse till our arrival, into a tolerably snug little apartment,\nformerly the scullery of the mansion, which Frederick had now fitted up\nas a kitchen. Here she procured us a light, roused the fire to a\ncheerful blaze, and soon prepared a simple repast for our refreshment;\nwhile we disencumbered ourselves of our travelling-gear, and took a\nhasty survey of our new abode. Besides the kitchen, there were two\nbedrooms, a good-sized parlour, and another smaller one, which I\ndestined for my studio, all well aired and seemingly in good repair,\nbut only partly furnished with a few old articles, chiefly of ponderous\nblack oak, the veritable ones that had been there before, and which had\nbeen kept as antiquarian relics in my brother's present residence, and\nnow, in all haste, transported back again.\nThe old woman brought my supper and Arthur's into the parlour, and told\nme, with all due formality, that \"the master desired his compliments to\nMrs. Graham, and he had prepared the rooms as well as he could upon so\nshort a notice; but he would do himself the pleasure of calling upon\nher to-morrow, to receive her further commands.\"",

He was asleep\nin a minute; but, weary as I was, my excited feelings and restless\ncogitations kept me awake till dawn began to struggle with the\ndarkness; but sleep was sweet and refreshing when it came, and the\nwaking was delightful beyond expression. It was little Arthur that\nroused me, with his gentle kisses. He was here, then, safely clasped in\nmy arms, and many leagues away from his unworthy father! Broad daylight\nillumined the apartment, for the sun was high in heaven, though\nobscured by rolling masses of autumnal vapour.\nThe scene, indeed, was not remarkably cheerful in itself, either within\nor without. The large bare room, with its grim old furniture, the\nnarrow, latticed windows, revealing the dull, grey sky above and the\ndesolate wilderness below, where the dark stone walls and iron gate,\nthe rank growth of grass and weeds, and the hardy evergreens of\npreternatural forms, alone remained to tell that there had been once a\ngarden,\u2014and the bleak and barren fields beyond might have struck me as\ngloomy enough at another time; but now, each separate object seemed to\necho back my own exhilarating sense of hope and freedom: indefinite\ndreams of the far past and bright anticipations of the future seemed to\ngreet me at every turn. I should rejoice with more security, to be\nsure, had the broad sea rolled between my present and my former homes;\nbut surely in this lonely spot I might remain unknown; and then I had\nmy brother here to cheer my solitude with his occasional visits.\nHe came that morning; and I have had several interviews with him since;\nbut he is obliged to be very cautious when and how he comes; not even\nhis servants or his best friends must know of his visits to\nWildfell\u2014except on such occasions as a landlord might be expected to\ncall upon a stranger tenant\u2014lest suspicion should be excited against\nme, whether of the truth or of some slanderous falsehood.\nI have now been here nearly a fortnight, and, but for one disturbing\ncare, the haunting dread of discovery, I am comfortably settled in my\nnew home: Frederick has supplied me with all requisite furniture and\npainting materials: Rachel has sold most of my clothes for me, in a\ndistant town, and procured me a wardrobe more suitable to my present\nposition: I have a second-hand piano, and a tolerably well-stocked\nbookcase in my parlour; and my other room has assumed quite a\nprofessional, business-like appearance already. I am working hard to\nrepay my brother for all his expenses on my account; not that there is\nthe slightest necessity for anything of the kind, but it pleases me to\ndo so: I shall have so much more pleasure in my labour, my earnings, my\nfrugal fare, and household economy, when I know that I am paying my way",

I\nshall make him take the last penny I owe him, if I can possibly effect\nit without offending him too deeply. I have a few pictures already\ndone, for I told Rachel to pack up all I had; and she executed her\ncommission but too well\u2014for among the rest, she put up a portrait of\nMr. Huntingdon that I had painted in the first year of my marriage. It\nstruck me with dismay, at the moment, when I took it from the box and\nbeheld those eyes fixed upon me in their mocking mirth, as if exulting\nstill in his power to control my fate, and deriding my efforts to\nescape.\nHow widely different had been my feelings in painting that portrait to\nwhat they now were in looking upon it! How I had studied and toiled to\nproduce something, as I thought, worthy of the original! what mingled\npleasure and dissatisfaction I had had in the result of my\nlabours!\u2014pleasure for the likeness I had caught; dissatisfaction,\nbecause I had not made it handsome enough. Now, I see no beauty in\nit\u2014nothing pleasing in any part of its expression; and yet it is far\nhandsomer and far more agreeable\u2014far less repulsive I should rather\nsay\u2014than he is now: for these six years have wrought almost as great a\nchange upon himself as on my feelings regarding him. The frame,\nhowever, is handsome enough; it will serve for another painting. The\npicture itself I have not destroyed, as I had first intended; I have\nput it aside; not, I think, from any lurking tenderness for the memory\nof past affection, nor yet to remind me of my former folly, but chiefly\nthat I may compare my son's features and countenance with this, as he\ngrows up, and thus be enabled to judge how much or how little he\nresembles his father\u2014if I may be allowed to keep him with me still, and\nnever to behold that father's face again\u2014a blessing I hardly dare\nreckon upon.\nIt seems Mr. Huntingdon is making every exertion to discover the place\nof my retreat. He has been in person to Staningley, seeking redress for\nhis grievances\u2014expecting to hear of his victims, if not to find them\nthere\u2014and has told so many lies, and with such unblushing coolness,\nthat my uncle more than half believes him, and strongly advocates my\ngoing back to him and being friends again. But my aunt knows better:\nshe is too cool and cautious, and too well acquainted with both my\nhusband's character and my own to be imposed upon by any specious\nfalsehoods the former could invent. But he does not _want_ me back; he\nwants my child; and gives my friends to understand that if I prefer\nliving apart from him, he will indulge the whim and let me do so\nunmolested, and even settle a reasonable allowance on me, provided I\nwill immediately deliver up his son.

Anxious and pale, it was turned towards me; her\nclear, dark eyes were fixed on mine with a gaze so intensely earnest\nthat they bound me like a spell.\n\"Have you looked it over?\" she murmured. The spell was broken.\n\"I've read it through,\" said I, advancing into the room,\u2014\"and I want to\nknow if you'll forgive me\u2014if you _can_ forgive me?\"\nShe did not answer, but her eyes glistened, and a faint red mantled on\nher lip and cheek. As I approached, she abruptly turned away, and went\nto the window. It was not in anger, I was well assured, but only to\nconceal or control her emotion. I therefore ventured to follow and\nstand beside her there,\u2014but not to speak. She gave me her hand, without\nturning her head, and murmured in a voice she strove in vain to\nsteady,\u2014\n\"Can _you_ forgive _me?_\"\nIt might be deemed a breach of trust, I thought, to convey that lily\nhand to my lips, so I only gently pressed it between my own, and\nsmilingly replied,\u2014\"I hardly can. You should have told me this before.\nIt shows a want of confidence\u2014\"\n\"Oh, no,\" cried she, eagerly interrupting me; \"it was not that. It was\nno want of confidence in you; but if I had told you anything of my\nhistory, I must have told you all, in order to excuse my conduct; and I\nmight well shrink from such a disclosure, till necessity obliged me to\nmake it. But you forgive me?\u2014I have done very, very wrong, I know; but,\nas usual, I have reaped the bitter fruits of my own error,\u2014and must\nreap them to the end.\"\nBitter, indeed, was the tone of anguish, repressed by resolute\nfirmness, in which this was spoken. Now, I raised her hand to my lips,\nand fervently kissed it again and again; for tears prevented any other\nreply. She suffered these wild caresses without resistance or\nresentment; then, suddenly turning from me, she paced twice or thrice\nthrough the room. I knew by the contraction of her brow, the tight\ncompression of her lips, and wringing of her hands, that meantime a\nviolent conflict between reason and passion was silently passing\nwithin. At length she paused before the empty fire-place, and turning\nto me, said calmly\u2014if that might be called calmness which was so\nevidently the result of a violent effort,\u2014\n\"Now, Gilbert, you must leave me\u2014not this moment, but soon\u2014and you must",

But immediately I\nadded in a quieter tone\u2014\"I'll do whatever you desire; only _don't_ say\nthat this meeting is to be our last.\"\n\"And why not? Don't you know that every time we meet the thoughts of\nthe final parting will become more painful? Don't you _feel_ that every\ninterview makes us dearer to each other than the last?\"\nThe utterance of this last question was hurried and low, and the\ndowncast eyes and burning blush too plainly showed that _she_, at\nleast, had felt it. It was scarcely prudent to make such an admission,\nor to add\u2014as she presently did\u2014\"I have power to bid you go, now:\nanother time it might be different,\"\u2014but I was not base enough to\nattempt to take advantage of her candour.\n\"But we may write,\" I timidly suggested. \"You will not deny me that\nconsolation?\"\n\"We can hear of each other through my brother.\"\n\"Your brother!\" A pang of remorse and shame shot through me. She had\nnot heard of the injury he had sustained at my hands; and I had not the\ncourage to tell her. \"Your brother will not help us,\" I said: \"he would\nhave all communion between us to be entirely at an end.\"\n\"And he would be right, I suppose. As a friend of both, he would wish\nus both well; and every friend would tell us it was our interest, as\nwell as our duty, to forget each other, though we might not see it\nourselves. But don't be afraid, Gilbert,\" she added, smiling sadly at\nmy manifest discomposure; \"there is little chance of my forgetting you.\nBut I did not mean that Frederick should be the means of transmitting\nmessages between us\u2014only that each might know, through him, of the\nother's welfare;\u2014and more than this ought not to be: for you are young,\nGilbert, and you ought to marry\u2014and will some time, though you may\nthink it impossible now: and though I hardly can say I wish you to\nforget me, I know it is right that you should, both for your own\nhappiness, and that of your future wife;\u2014and therefore I must and will\nwish it,\" she added resolutely.\n\"And you are young too, Helen,\" I boldly replied; \"and when that\nprofligate scoundrel has run through his career, you will give your\nhand to me\u2014I'll wait till then.\"\nBut she would not leave me this support. Independently of the moral\nevil of basing our hopes upon the death of another, who, if unfit for\nthis world, was at least no less so for the next, and whose\namelioration would thus become our bane and his greatest transgression\nour greatest benefit,\u2014she maintained it to be madness: many men of Mr.\nHuntingdon's habits had lived to a ripe though miserable old age. \"And\nif I,\" said she, \"am young in years, I am old in sorrow; but even if\ntrouble should fail to kill me before vice destroys him, think, if he\nreached but fifty years or so, would you wait twenty or fifteen\u2014in\nvague uncertainty and suspense\u2014through all the prime of youth and\nmanhood\u2014and marry at last a woman faded and worn as I shall be\u2014without\never having seen me from this day to that?\u2014You would not,\" she\ncontinued, interrupting my earnest protestations of unfailing\nconstancy,\u2014\"or if you would, you should not. Trust me, Gilbert; in this\nmatter I know better than you. You think me cold and stony-hearted, and\nyou may, but\u2014\"\n\"I don't, Helen.\"\n\"Well, never mind: you might if you would: but I have not spent my\nsolitude in utter idleness, and I am not speaking now from the impulse\nof the moment, as you do. I have thought of all these matters again and\nagain; I have argued these questions with myself, and pondered well our\npast, and present, and future career; and, believe me, I have come to\nthe right conclusion at last. Trust my words rather than your own\nfeelings now, and in a few years you will see that I was right\u2014though\nat present I hardly can see it myself,\" she murmured with a sigh as she\nrested her head on her hand. \"And don't argue against me any more: all\nyou can say has been already said by my own heart and refuted by my\nreason. It was hard enough to combat those suggestions as they were\nwhispered within me; in your mouth they are ten times worse, and if you\nknew how much they pain me you would cease at once, I know. If you knew\nmy present feelings, you would even try to relieve them at the expense\nof your own.\"\n\"I will go\u2014in a minute, if _that_ can relieve you\u2014and NEVER return!\"\nsaid I, with bitter emphasis. \"But, if we may never meet, and never\nhope to meet again, is it a crime to exchange our thoughts by letter?\nMay not kindred spirits meet, and mingle in communion, whatever be the\nfate and circumstances of their earthly tenements?\"\n\"They may, they may!\" cried she, with a momentary burst of glad\nenthusiasm. \"I thought of that too, Gilbert, but I feared to mention\nit, because I feared you would not understand my views upon the\nsubject. I fear it even now\u2014I fear any kind friend would tell us we are\n_both_ deluding ourselves with the idea of keeping up a spiritual\nintercourse without hope or prospect of anything further\u2014without\nfostering vain regrets and hurtful aspirations, and feeding thoughts\nthat should be sternly and pitilessly left to perish of inanition.\"\n\"Never mind our kind friends: if they can part our bodies, it is\nenough; in God's name, let them not sunder our souls!\" cried I, in\nterror lest she should deem it her duty to deny us this last remaining\nconsolation.\n\"But no letters can pass between us here,\" said she, \"without giving\nfresh food for scandal; and when I departed, I had intended that my new\nabode should be unknown to you as to the rest of the world; not that I\nshould doubt your word if you promised not to visit me, but I thought\nyou would be more tranquil in your own mind if you knew you could not\ndo it, and likely to find less difficulty in abstracting yourself from\nme if you could not picture my situation to your mind. But listen,\"\nsaid she, smilingly putting up her finger to check my impatient reply:\n\"in six months you shall hear from Frederick precisely where I am; and\nif you still retain your wish to write to me, and think you can\nmaintain a correspondence all thought, all spirit\u2014such as disembodied\nsouls or unimpassioned friends, at least, might hold,\u2014write, and I will\nanswer you.\"\n\"Six months!\"\n\"Yes, to give your present ardour time to cool, and try the truth and\nconstancy of your soul's love for mine. And now, enough has been said\nbetween us. Why can't we part at once?\" exclaimed she, almost wildly,\nafter a moment's pause, as she suddenly rose from her chair, with her\nhands resolutely clasped together. I thought it was my duty to go\nwithout delay; and I approached and half extended my hand as if to take\nleave\u2014she grasped it in silence. But this thought of final separation\nwas too intolerable: it seemed to squeeze the blood out of my heart;\nand my feet were glued to the floor.\n\"And must we never meet again?\" I murmured, in the anguish of my soul.\n\"We shall meet in heaven. Let us think of that,\" said she in a tone of\ndesperate calmness; but her eyes glittered wildly, and her face was\ndeadly pale.\n\"But not as we are now,\" I could not help replying. \"It gives me little\nconsolation to think I shall next behold you as a disembodied spirit,\nor an altered being, with a frame perfect and glorious, but not like\nthis!\u2014and a heart, perhaps, entirely estranged from me.\"\n\"No, Gilbert, there is perfect love in heaven!\"\n\"_So_ perfect, I suppose, that it soars above distinctions, and you\nwill have no closer sympathy with me than with any one of the ten\nthousand thousand angels and the innumerable multitude of happy spirits\nround us.\"\n\"Whatever I am, you will be the same, and, therefore, cannot possibly\nregret it; and whatever that change may be we know it must be for the\nbetter.\"\n\"But if I am to be so changed that I shall cease to adore you with my\nwhole heart and soul, and love you beyond every other creature, I shall\nnot be myself; and though, if ever I win heaven at all, I must, I know,\nbe infinitely better and happier than I am now, my earthly nature\ncannot rejoice in the anticipation of such beatitude, from which itself\nand its chief joy must be excluded.\"\n\"Is your love _all_ earthly, then?\"\n\"No, but I am supposing we shall have no more intimate communion with\neach other than with the rest.\"\n\"If so, it will be because we love them more, and not each other less.\nIncrease of love brings increase of happiness, when it is mutual, and\npure as that will be.\"\n\"But can _you_, Helen, contemplate with delight this prospect of losing\nme in a sea of glory?\"\n\"I own I cannot; but we know not that it will be so;\u2014and I do know that\nto regret the exchange of earthly pleasures for the joys of heaven, is\nas if the grovelling caterpillar should lament that it must one day\nquit the nibbled leaf to soar aloft and flutter through the air, roving\nat will from flower to flower, sipping sweet honey from their cups, or\nbasking in their sunny petals. If these little creatures knew how great\na change awaited them, no doubt they would regret it; but would not all\nsuch sorrow be misplaced? And if that illustration will not move you,\nhere is another:\u2014We are children now; we feel as children, and we\nunderstand as children; and when we are told that men and women do not\nplay with toys, and that our companions will one day weary of the\ntrivial sports and occupations that interest them and us so deeply now,\nwe cannot help being saddened at the thoughts of such an alteration,\nbecause we cannot conceive that as we grow up our own minds will become\nso enlarged and elevated that we ourselves shall then regard as\ntrifling those objects and pursuits we now so fondly cherish, and that,\nthough our companions will no longer join us in those childish\npastimes, they will drink with us at other fountains of delight, and\nmingle their souls with ours in higher aims and nobler occupations\nbeyond our present comprehension, but not less deeply relished or less\ntruly good for that, while yet both we and they remain essentially the\nsame individuals as before. But, Gilbert, can you really derive no\nconsolation from the thought that we may meet together where there is\nno more pain and sorrow, no more striving against sin, and struggling\nof the spirit against the flesh; where both will behold the same\nglorious truths, and drink exalted and supreme felicity from the same\nfountain of light and goodness\u2014that Being whom both will worship with\nthe same intensity of holy ardour\u2014and where pure and happy creatures\nboth will love with the same divine affection? If you cannot, never\nwrite to me!\"\n\"Helen, I can! if faith would never fail.\"\n\"Now, then,\" exclaimed she, \"while this hope is strong within us\u2014\"\n\"We will part,\" I cried. \"You shall not have the pain of another effort\nto dismiss me. I will go at once; but\u2014\"\nI did not put my request in words: she understood it instinctively, and\n_this_ time she yielded too\u2014or rather, there was nothing so deliberate\nas requesting or yielding in the matter: there was a sudden impulse\nthat neither could resist. One moment I stood and looked into her face,\nthe next I held her to my heart, and we seemed to grow together in a\nclose embrace from which no physical or mental force could rend us. A\nwhispered \"God bless you!\" and \"Go\u2014go!\" was all she said; but while she\nspoke she held me so fast that, without violence, I could not have\nobeyed her.

I deferred it, however,\ntill the evening, when my spirits were more composed, and when\u2014oh,\nwonderful perversity of human nature!\u2014some faint germs of indefinite\nhopes were beginning to rise in my mind; not that I intended to cherish\nthem, after all that had been said on the subject, but there they must\nlie for a while, uncrushed though not encouraged, till I had learnt to\nlive without them.\nArrived at Woodford, the young squire's abode, I found no little\ndifficulty in obtaining admission to his presence. The servant that\nopened the door told me his master was very ill, and seemed to think it\ndoubtful whether he would be able to see me. I was not going to be\nbaulked, however. I waited calmly in the hall to be announced, but\ninwardly determined to take no denial. The message was such as I\nexpected\u2014a polite intimation that Mr. Lawrence could see no one; he was\nfeverish, and must not be disturbed.\n\"I shall not disturb him long,\" said I; \"but I must see him for a\nmoment: it is on business of importance that I wish to speak to him.\"\n\"I'll tell him, sir,\" said the man. And I advanced further into the\nhall and followed him nearly to the door of the apartment where his\nmaster was\u2014for it seemed he was not in bed. The answer returned was\nthat Mr. Lawrence hoped I would be so good as to leave a message or a\nnote with the servant, as he could attend to no business at present.\n\"He may as well see me as you,\" said I; and, stepping past the\nastonished footman, I boldly rapped at the door, entered, and closed it\nbehind me. The room was spacious and handsomely furnished\u2014very\ncomfortably, too, for a bachelor. A clear, red fire was burning in the\npolished grate: a superannuated greyhound, given up to idleness and\ngood living, lay basking before it on the thick, soft rug, on one\ncorner of which, beside the sofa, sat a smart young springer, looking\nwistfully up in its master's face\u2014perhaps asking permission to share\nhis couch, or, it might be, only soliciting a caress from his hand or a\nkind word from his lips. The invalid himself looked very interesting as\nhe lay reclining there, in his elegant dressing-gown, with a silk\nhandkerchief bound across his temples. His usually pale face was\nflushed and feverish; his eyes were half closed, until he became\nsensible of my presence\u2014and then he opened them wide enough: one hand\nwas thrown listlessly over the back of the sofa, and held a small\nvolume, with which, apparently, he had been vainly attempting to\nbeguile the weary hours. He dropped it, however, in his start of\nindignant surprise as I advanced into the room and stood before him on\nthe rug. He raised himself on his pillows, and gazed upon me with equal\ndegrees of nervous horror, anger, and amazement depicted on his\ncountenance.\n\"Mr. Markham, I scarcely expected this!\" he said; and the blood left\nhis cheek as he spoke.\n\"I know you didn't,\" answered I; \"but be quiet a minute, and I'll tell\nyou what I came for.\" Unthinkingly, I advanced a step or two nearer. He\nwinced at my approach, with an expression of aversion and instinctive\nphysical fear anything but conciliatory to my feelings. I stepped back,\nhowever.\n\"Make your story a short one,\" said he, putting his hand on the small\nsilver bell that stood on the table beside him, \"or I shall be obliged\nto call for assistance. I am in no state to bear your brutalities now,\nor your presence either.\" And in truth the moisture started from his\npores and stood on his pale forehead like dew.\nSuch a reception was hardly calculated to diminish the difficulties of\nmy unenviable task. It must be performed however, in some fashion; and\nso I plunged into it at once, and floundered through it as I could.\n\"The truth is, Lawrence,\" said I, \"I have not acted quite correctly\ntowards you of late\u2014especially on this last occasion; and I'm come\nto\u2014in short, to express my regret for what has been done, and to beg\nyour pardon. If you don't choose to grant it,\" I added hastily, not\nliking the aspect of his face, \"it's no matter; only _I've_ done _my_\nduty\u2014that's all.\"\n\"It's easily done,\" replied he, with a faint smile bordering on a\nsneer: \"to abuse your friend and knock him on the head without any\nassignable cause, and then tell him the deed was not quite correct, but\nit's no matter whether he pardons it or not.\"\n\"I forgot to tell you that it was in consequence of a\nmistake,\"\u2014muttered I. \"I should have made a very handsome apology, but\nyou provoked me so confoundedly with your\u2014. Well, I suppose it's my\nfault. The fact is, I didn't know that you were Mrs. Graham's brother,\nand I saw and heard some things respecting your conduct towards her\nwhich were calculated to awaken unpleasant suspicions, that, allow me\nto say, a little candour and confidence on your part might have\nremoved; and, at last, I chanced to overhear a part of a conversation\nbetween you and her that made me think I had a right to hate you.\"\n\"And how came you to know that I was her brother?\" asked he, in some\nanxiety.\n\"She told me herself. She told me all. _She_ knew I might be trusted.\nBut you needn't disturb yourself about _that_, Mr. Lawrence, for I've\nseen the last of her!\"\n\"The last! Is she gone, then?\"\n\"No; but she has bid adieu to me, and I have promised never to go near\nthat house again while she inhabits it.\" I could have groaned aloud at\nthe bitter thoughts awakened by this turn in the discourse. But I only\nclenched my hands and stamped my foot upon the rug. My companion,\nhowever, was evidently relieved.\n\"You have done right,\" he said, in a tone of unqualified approbation,\nwhile his face brightened into almost a sunny expression. \"And as for\nthe mistake, I am sorry for both our sakes that it should have\noccurred. Perhaps you can forgive my want of candour, and remember, as\nsome partial mitigation of the offence, how little encouragement to\nfriendly confidence you have given me of late.\"\n\"Yes, yes\u2014I remember it all: nobody can blame me more than I blame\nmyself in my own heart; at any rate, nobody can regret more sincerely\nthan I do the result of my _brutality_, as you rightly term it.\"\n\"Never mind that,\" said he, faintly smiling; \"let us forget all\nunpleasant words on both sides, as well as deeds, and consign to\noblivion everything that we have cause to regret. Have you any\nobjection to take my hand, or you'd rather not?\" It trembled through\nweakness as he held it out, and dropped before I had time to catch it\nand give it a hearty squeeze, which he had not the strength to return.\n\"How dry and burning your hand is, Lawrence,\" said I. \"You are really\nill, and I have made you worse by all this talk.\"\n\"Oh, it is nothing; only a cold got by the rain.\"\n\"My doing, too.\"\n\"Never mind that. But tell me, did you mention this affair to my\nsister?\"\n\"To confess the truth, I had not the courage to do so; but when you\ntell her, will you just say that I deeply regret it, and\u2014?\"\n\"Oh, never fear! I shall say nothing against you, as long as you keep\nyour good resolution of remaining aloof from her. She has not heard of\nmy illness, then, that you are aware of?\"\n\"I think not.\"\n\"I'm glad of that, for I have been all this time tormenting myself with\nthe fear that somebody would tell her I was dying, or desperately ill,\nand she would be either distressing herself on account of her inability\nto hear from me or do me any good, or perhaps committing the madness of\ncoming to see me. I must contrive to let her know something about it,\nif I can,\" continued he, reflectively, \"or she will be hearing some\nsuch story. Many would be glad to tell her such news, just to see how\nshe would take it; and then she might expose herself to fresh scandal.\"\n\"I wish I had told her,\" said I. \"If it were not for my promise, I\nwould tell her now.\"\n\"By no means! I am not dreaming of that;\u2014but if I were to write a short\nnote, now, not mentioning you, Markham, but just giving a slight\naccount of my illness, by way of excuse for my not coming to see her,\nand to put her on her guard against any exaggerated reports she may\nhear,\u2014and address it in a disguised hand\u2014would you do me the favour to\nslip it into the post-office as you pass? for I dare not trust any of\nthe servants in such a case.\"\nMost willingly I consented, and immediately brought him his desk. There\nwas little need to disguise his hand, for the poor fellow seemed to\nhave considerable difficulty in writing at all, so as to be legible.\nWhen the note was done, I thought it time to retire, and took leave,\nafter asking if there was anything in the world I could do for him,\nlittle or great, in the way of alleviating his sufferings, and\nrepairing the injury I had done.\n\"No,\" said he; \"you have already done much towards it; you have done\nmore for me than the most skilful physician could do: for you have\nrelieved my mind of two great burdens\u2014anxiety on my sister's account,\nand deep regret upon your own: for I do believe these two sources of\ntorment have had more effect in working me up into a fever than\nanything else; and I am persuaded I shall soon recover now. There is\none more thing you can do for me, and that is, come and see me now and\nthen\u2014for you see I am very lonely here, and I promise your entrance\nshall not be disputed again.\"\nI engaged to do so, and departed with a cordial pressure of the hand.

I\ndon't think anybody believed me, but everybody soon learned to avoid\ninsinuating a word against her, or even mentioning her name in my\npresence.

She knows it is impossible that I should forget _her;_\nand she is right to wish me not to remember her too well. I should not\ndesire her to regret me _too_ deeply; but I can scarcely imagine she\nwill make herself very unhappy about me, because I know I am not worthy\nof it, except in my appreciation of her.\"\n\"You are neither of you worthy of a broken heart,\u2014nor of all the sighs,\nand tears, and sorrowful thoughts that have been, and I fear will be,\nwasted upon you both; but, at present, each has a more exalted opinion\nof the other than, I fear, he or she deserves; and my sister's feelings\nare naturally full as keen as yours, and I believe _more_ constant; but\nshe has the good sense and fortitude to strive against them in this\nparticular; and I trust she will not rest till she has entirely weaned\nher thoughts\u2014\" he hesitated.",

Why not?\"\n\"Oh, well!\" was my only audible reply; but I internally answered,\u2014\"No,\nLawrence, you're wrong there: she is _not_ determined to forget me. It\nwould be _wrong_ to forget one so deeply and fondly devoted to her, who\ncan so thoroughly appreciate her excellencies, and sympathise with all\nher thoughts, as I can do, and it would be wrong in me to forget so\nexcellent and divine a piece of God's creation as she, when I have once\nso truly loved and known her.\" But I said no more to him on that\nsubject. I instantly started a new topic of conversation, and soon took\nleave of my companion, with a feeling of less cordiality towards him\nthan usual. Perhaps I had no right to be annoyed at him, but I was so\nnevertheless.\nIn little more than a week after this I met him returning from a visit\nto the Wilsons'; and I now resolved to do _him_ a good turn, though at\nthe expense of his feelings, and perhaps at the risk of incurring that\ndispleasure which is so commonly the reward of those who give\ndisagreeable information, or tender their advice unasked. In this,\nbelieve me, I was actuated by no motives of revenge for the occasional\nannoyances I had lately sustained from him,\u2014nor yet by any feeling of\nmalevolent enmity towards Miss Wilson, but purely by the fact that I\ncould not endure that such a woman should be Mrs. Huntingdon's sister,\nand that, as well for his own sake as for hers, I could not bear to\nthink of his being deceived into a union with one so unworthy of him,\nand so utterly unfitted to be the partner of his quiet home, and the\ncompanion of his life. He had had uncomfortable suspicions on that head\nhimself, I imagined; but such was his inexperience, and such were the\nlady's powers of attraction, and her skill in bringing them to bear\nupon his young imagination, that they had not disturbed him long; and I\nbelieve the only effectual causes of the vacillating indecision that\nhad preserved him hitherto from making an actual declaration of love,\nwas the consideration of her connections, and especially of her mother,\nwhom he could not abide. Had they lived at a distance, he might have\nsurmounted the objection, but within two or three miles of Woodford it\nwas really no light matter.\n\"You've been to call on the Wilsons, Lawrence,\" said I, as I walked\nbeside his pony.\n\"Yes,\" replied he, slightly averting his face: \"I thought it but civil\nto take the first opportunity of returning their kind attentions, since\nthey have been so very particular and constant in their inquiries\nthroughout the whole course of my illness.\"\n\"It's all Miss Wilson's doing.\"\n\"And if it is,\" returned he, with a very perceptible blush, \"is that\nany reason why I should not make a suitable acknowledgment?\"\n\"It is a reason why you should not make the acknowledgment she looks\nfor.\"\n\"Let us drop that subject if you please,\" said he, in evident\ndispleasure.\n\"No, Lawrence, with your leave we'll continue it a while longer; and\nI'll tell you something, now we're about it, which you may believe or\nnot as you choose\u2014only please to remember that it is not my custom to\nspeak falsely, and that in this case I can have no motive for\nmisrepresenting the truth\u2014\"\n\"Well, Markham, what now?\"\n\"_Miss Wilson hates your sister._ It may be natural enough that, in her\nignorance of the relationship, she should feel some degree of enmity\nagainst her, but no good or amiable woman would be capable of evincing\nthat bitter, cold-blooded, designing malice towards a fancied rival\nthat I have observed in her.\"\n\"Markham!\"\n\"Yes\u2014and it is my belief that Eliza Millward and she, if not the very\noriginators of the slanderous reports that have been propagated, were\ndesignedly the encouragers and chief disseminators of them. She was not\ndesirous to mix up _your_ name in the matter, of course, but her\ndelight was, and still is, to blacken your sister's character to the\nutmost of her power, without risking too greatly the exposure of her\nown malevolence!\"\n\"I cannot believe it,\" interrupted my companion, his face burning with\nindignation.\n\"Well, as I cannot prove it, I must content myself with asserting that\nit is so to the best of my belief; but as you would not willingly marry\nMiss Wilson if it _were_ so, you will do well to be cautious, till you\nhave proved it to be otherwise.\"\n\"I never told you, Markham, that I _intended_ to marry Miss Wilson,\"\nsaid he, proudly.\n\"No, but whether you do or not, she intends to marry you.\"\n\"Did she tell you so?\"\n\"No, but\u2014\"\n\"Then you have no right to make such an assertion respecting her.\" He\nslightly quickened his pony's pace, but I laid my hand on its mane,\ndetermined he should not leave me yet.\n\"Wait a moment, Lawrence, and let me explain myself; and don't be so\nvery\u2014I don't know what to call it\u2014_inaccessible_ as you are.\u2014I know\nwhat you think of Jane Wilson; and I believe I know how far you are\nmistaken in your opinion: you think she is singularly charming,\nelegant, sensible, and refined: you are not aware that she is selfish,\ncold-hearted, ambitious, artful, shallow-minded\u2014\"\n\"Enough, Markham\u2014enough!\"\n\"No; let me finish:\u2014you don't know that, if you married her, your home\nwould be rayless and comfortless; and it would break your heart at last\nto find yourself united to one so wholly incapable of sharing your\ntastes, feelings, and ideas\u2014so utterly destitute of sensibility, good\nfeeling, and true nobility of soul.\"\n\"Have you done?\" asked my companion quietly.\n\"Yes;\u2014I know you hate me for my impertinence, but I don't care if it\nonly conduces to preserve you from that fatal mistake.\"\n\"Well!\" returned he, with a rather wintry smile\u2014\"I'm glad you have\novercome or forgotten your own afflictions so far as to be able to\nstudy so deeply the affairs of others, and trouble your head so\nunnecessarily about the fancied or possible calamities of their future\nlife.\"\nWe parted\u2014somewhat coldly again: but still we did not cease to be\nfriends; and my well-meant warning, though it might have been more\njudiciously delivered, as well as more thankfully received, was not\nwholly unproductive of the desired effect: his visit to the Wilsons was\nnot repeated, and though, in our subsequent interviews, he never",

Rose had neither the discrimination nor the virulence\nto regard the little demon as I did, and they still preserved their\nformer intimacy. At the moment of her arrival, however, there was no\none in the room but Fergus and myself, my mother and sister being both\nof them absent, \"on household cares intent\"; but _I_ was not going to\nlay myself out for her amusement, whoever else might so incline: I\nmerely honoured her with a careless salutation and a few words of\ncourse, and then went on with my writing, leaving my brother to be more\npolite if he chose. But she wanted to tease me.\n\"What a pleasure it is to find you at home, Mr. Markham!\" said she,\nwith a disingenuously malicious smile. \"I so seldom see you now, for\nyou never come to the vicarage. Papa, is quite offended, I can tell\nyou,\" she added playfully, looking into my face with an impertinent\nlaugh, as she seated herself, half beside and half before my desk, off\nthe corner of the table.\n\"I have had a good deal to do of late,\" said I, without looking up from\nmy letter.\n\"Have you, indeed! Somebody said you had been strangely neglecting your\nbusiness these last few months.\"\n\"Somebody said wrong, for, these last two months especially, I have\nbeen particularly plodding and diligent.\"\n\"Ah! well, there's nothing like active employment, I suppose, to\nconsole the afflicted;\u2014and, excuse me, Mr. Markham, but you look so\nvery far from well, and have been, by all accounts, so moody and\nthoughtful of late,\u2014I could almost think you have some secret care\npreying on your spirits. _Formerly_,\" said she timidly, \"I could have\nventured to ask you what it was, and what I could do to comfort you: I\ndare not do it now.\"\n\"You're very kind, Miss Eliza. When I think you can do anything to\ncomfort me, I'll make bold to tell you.\"\n\"Pray do!\u2014I suppose I mayn't guess what it is that troubles you?\"\n\"There's no necessity, for I'll tell you plainly. The thing that\ntroubles me the most at present is a young lady sitting at my elbow,\nand preventing me from finishing my letter, and, thereafter, repairing\nto my daily business.\"\nBefore she could reply to this ungallant speech, Rose entered the room;\nand Miss Eliza rising to greet her, they both seated themselves near\nthe fire, where that idle lad Fergus was standing, leaning his shoulder\nagainst the corner of the chimney-piece, with his legs crossed and his\nhands in his breeches-pockets.\n\"Now, Rose, I'll tell you a piece of news\u2014I hope you have not heard it\nbefore: for good, bad, or indifferent, one always likes to be the first\nto tell. It's about that sad Mrs. Graham\u2014\"\n\"Hush-sh-sh!\" whispered Fergus, in a tone of solemn import. \"'We never\nmention her; her name is never heard.'\" And glancing up, I caught him\nwith his eye askance on me, and his finger pointed to his forehead;\nthen, winking at the young lady with a doleful shake of the head, he\nwhispered\u2014\"A monomania\u2014but don't mention it\u2014all right but that.\"\n\"I should be sorry to injure any one's feelings,\" returned she,\nspeaking below her breath. \"Another time, perhaps.\"\n\"Speak out, Miss Eliza!\" said I, not deigning to notice the other's\nbuffooneries: \"you needn't fear to say anything in my presence.\"\n\"Well,\" answered she, \"perhaps you know already that Mrs. Graham's\nhusband is not really dead, and that she had run away from him?\" I\nstarted, and felt my face glow; but I bent it over my letter, and went\non folding it up as she proceeded. \"But perhaps you did _not_ know that\nshe is now gone back to him again, and that a perfect reconciliation\nhas taken place between them? Only think,\" she continued, turning to\nthe confounded Rose, \"what a fool the man must be!\"\n\"And who gave you this piece of intelligence, Miss Eliza?\" said I,\ninterrupting my sister's exclamations.\n\"I had it from a very authentic source.\"\n\"From whom, may I ask?\"\n\"From one of the servants at Woodford.\"\n\"Oh! I was not aware that you were on such intimate terms with Mr.\nLawrence's household.\"\n\"It was not from the man himself that I heard it, but he told it in\nconfidence to our maid Sarah, and Sarah told it to me.\"\n\"In confidence, I suppose? And you tell it in confidence to us? But _I_\ncan tell _you_ that it is but a lame story after all, and scarcely\none-half of it true.\"\nWhile I spoke I completed the sealing and direction of my letters, with\na somewhat unsteady hand, in spite of all my efforts to retain\ncomposure, and in spite of my firm conviction that the story _was_ a\nlame one\u2014that the supposed Mrs. Graham, most certainly, had not\n_voluntarily_ gone back to her husband, or dreamt of a reconciliation.\nMost likely she was gone away, and the tale-bearing servant, not\nknowing what was become of her, had _conjectured_ that such was the\ncase, and our fair visitor had detailed it as a certainty, delighted\nwith such an opportunity of tormenting me. But it was possible\u2014barely\npossible\u2014that some one might have betrayed her, and she had been taken\naway by force. Determined to know the worst, I hastily pocketed my two\nletters, and muttered something about being too late for the post, left\nthe room, rushed into the yard, and vociferously called for my horse.",

By an irresistible impulse I held out my hand,\nand the words, \"Let me see it,\" involuntarily passed my lips. He was\nevidently reluctant to grant the request, but while he hesitated I\nsnatched it from his hand. Recollecting myself, however, the minute\nafter, I offered to restore it.\n\"Here, take it,\" said I, \"if you don't want me to read it.\"\n\"No,\" replied he, \"you may read it if you like.\"\nI read it, and so may you.\nGrassdale, Nov. 4th.\nDEAR FREDERICK,\u2014I know you will be anxious to hear from me, and I will\ntell you all I can. Mr. Huntingdon is very ill, but not dying, or in\nany immediate danger; and he is rather better at present than he was\nwhen I came. I found the house in sad confusion: Mrs. Greaves, Benson,\nevery decent servant had left, and those that were come to supply their\nplaces were a negligent, disorderly set, to say no worse\u2014I must change\nthem again, if I stay. A professional nurse, a grim, hard old woman,\nhad been hired to attend the wretched invalid. He suffers much, and has\nno fortitude to bear him through. The immediate injuries he sustained\nfrom the accident, however, were not very severe, and would, as the\ndoctor says, have been but trifling to a man of temperate habits, but\nwith _him_ it is very different. On the night of my arrival, when I\nfirst entered his room, he was lying in a kind of half delirium. He did\nnot notice me till I spoke, and then he mistook me for another.\n\"Is it you, Alice, come again?\" he murmured. \"What did you leave me\nfor?\"\n\"It is I, Arthur\u2014it is Helen, your wife,\" I replied.\n\"My wife!\" said he, with a start. \"For heaven's sake, don't mention\nher\u2014I have none. Devil take her,\" he cried, a moment after, \"and you,\ntoo! What did you do it for?\"\nI said no more; but observing that he kept gazing towards the foot of\nthe bed, I went and sat there, placing the light so as to shine full\nupon me, for I thought he might be dying, and I wanted him to know me.\nFor a long time he lay silently looking upon me, first with a vacant\nstare, then with a fixed gaze of strange growing intensity. At last he\nstartled me by suddenly raising himself on his elbow and demanding in a\nhorrified whisper, with his eyes still fixed upon me, \"Who is it?\"\n\"It is Helen Huntingdon,\" said I, quietly rising at the same time, and\nremoving to a less conspicuous position.\n\"I must be going mad,\" cried he, \"or something\u2014delirious, perhaps; but\nleave me, whoever you are. I can't bear that white face, and those\neyes. For God's sake go, and send me somebody else that doesn't look\nlike that!\"\nI went at once, and sent the hired nurse; but next morning I ventured\nto enter his chamber again, and, taking the nurse's place by his\nbedside, I watched him and waited on him for several hours, showing\nmyself as little as possible, and only speaking when necessary, and\nthen not above my breath. At first he addressed me as the nurse, but,\non my crossing the room to draw up the window-blinds, in obedience to\nhis directions, he said, \"No, it isn't nurse; it's Alice. Stay with me,\ndo! That old hag will be the death of me.\"\n\"I mean to stay with you,\" said I. And after that he would call me\nAlice, or some other name almost equally repugnant to my feelings. I\nforced myself to endure it for a while, fearing a contradiction might\ndisturb him too much; but when, having asked for a glass of water,\nwhile I held it to his lips, he murmured, \"Thanks, dearest!\" I could\nnot help distinctly observing, \"You would not say so if you knew me,\"\nintending to follow that up with another declaration of my identity;\nbut he merely muttered an incoherent reply, so I dropped it again, till\nsome time after, when, as I was bathing his forehead and temples with\nvinegar and water to relieve the heat and pain in his head, he\nobserved, after looking earnestly upon me for some minutes, \"I have\nsuch strange fancies\u2014I can't get rid of them, and they won't let me\nrest; and the most singular and pertinacious of them all is your face\nand voice\u2014they seem just like hers. I could swear at this moment that\nshe was by my side.\"\n\"She is,\" said I.\n\"That seems comfortable,\" continued he, without noticing my words; \"and\nwhile you do it, the other fancies fade away\u2014but _this_ only\nstrengthens.\u2014Go on\u2014go on, till it vanishes, too. I can't stand such a\nmania as this; it would kill me!\"\n\"It never will vanish,\" said I, distinctly, \"for it is the truth!\"\n\"The truth!\" he cried, starting, as if an asp had stung him. \"You don't\nmean to say that you are really she?\"\n\"I do; but you needn't shrink away from me, as if I were your greatest\nenemy: I am come to take care of you, and do what none of _them_ would\ndo.\"\n\"For God's sake, don't torment me now!\" cried he in pitiable agitation;\nand then he began to mutter bitter curses against me, or the evil\nfortune that had brought me there; while I put down the sponge and\nbasin, and resumed my seat at the bed-side.\n\"Where are they?\" said he: \"have they all left me\u2014servants and all?\"\n\"There are servants within call if you want them; but you had better\nlie down now and be quiet: none of them could or would attend you as\ncarefully as I shall do.\"\n\"I can't understand it at all,\" said he, in bewildered perplexity. \"Was\nit a dream that\u2014\" and he covered his eyes with his hands, as if trying\nto unravel the mystery.\n\"No, Arthur, it was not a dream, that your conduct was such as to\noblige me to leave you; but I heard that you were ill and alone, and I\nam come back to nurse you. You need not fear to trust me: tell me all\nyour wants, and I will try to satisfy them. There is no one else to\ncare for you; and I shall not upbraid you now.\"\n\"Oh! I see,\" said he, with a bitter smile; \"it's an act of Christian\ncharity, whereby you hope to gain a higher seat in heaven for yourself,\nand scoop a deeper pit in hell for me.\"\n\"No; I came to offer you that comfort and assistance your situation\nrequired; and if I could benefit your soul as well as your body, and\nawaken some sense of contrition and\u2014\"\n\"Oh, yes; if you could overwhelm me with remorse and confusion of face,\nnow's the time. What have you done with my son?\"\n\"He is well, and you may see him some time, if you will compose\nyourself, but not now.\"\n\"Where is he?\"\n\"He is safe.\"\n\"Is he here?\"\n\"Wherever he is, you will not see him till you have promised to leave\nhim entirely under my care and protection, and to let me take him away\nwhenever and wherever I please, if I should hereafter judge it\nnecessary to remove him again. But we will talk of that to-morrow: you\nmust be quiet now.\"\n\"No, let me see him now, I promise, if it _must_ be so.\"\n\"No\u2014\"\n\"I swear it, as God is in Heaven! Now, then, let me see him.\"\n\"But I cannot trust your oaths and promises: I must have a written\nagreement, and you must sign it in presence of a witness: but not\nto-day\u2014to-morrow.\"\n\"No, to-day; now,\" persisted he: and he was in such a state of feverish\nexcitement, and so bent upon the immediate gratification of his wish,\nthat I thought it better to grant it at once, as I saw he would not\nrest till I did. But I was determined my son's interest should not be\nforgotten; and having clearly written out the promise I wished Mr.\nHuntingdon to give upon a slip of paper, I deliberately read it over to\nhim, and made him sign it in the presence of Rachel. He begged I would\nnot insist upon this: it was a useless exposure of my want of faith in\nhis word to the servant. I told him I was sorry, but since he had\nforfeited my confidence, he must take the consequence. He next pleaded\ninability to hold the pen. \"Then we must wait until you can hold it,\"\nsaid I. Upon which he said he would try; but then he could not see to\nwrite. I placed my finger where the signature was to be, and told him\nhe might write his name in the dark, if he only knew where to put it.\nBut he had not power to form the letters. \"In that case, you must be\ntoo ill to see the child,\" said I; and finding me inexorable, he at\nlength managed to ratify the agreement; and I bade Rachel send the boy.\nAll this may strike you as harsh, but I felt I must not lose my present\nadvantage, and my son's future welfare should not be sacrificed to any\nmistaken tenderness for this man's feelings. Little Arthur had not\nforgotten his father, but thirteen months of absence, during which he\nhad seldom been permitted to hear a word about him, or hardly to\nwhisper his name, had rendered him somewhat shy; and when he was\nushered into the darkened room where the sick man lay, so altered from\nhis former self, with fiercely flushed face and wildly-gleaming eyes\u2014he\ninstinctively clung to me, and stood looking on his father with a\ncountenance expressive of far more awe than pleasure.\n\"Come here, Arthur,\" said the latter, extending his hand towards him.\nThe child went, and timidly touched that burning hand, but almost\nstarted in alarm, when his father suddenly clutched his arm and drew\nhim nearer to his side.\n\"Do you know me?\" asked Mr. Huntingdon, intently perusing his features.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Who am I?\"\n\"Papa.\"\n\"Are you glad to see me?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"You're _not!_\" replied the disappointed parent, relaxing his hold, and\ndarting a vindictive glance at me.\nArthur, thus released, crept back to me and put his hand in mine. His\nfather swore I had made the child hate him, and abused and cursed me\nbitterly. The instant he began I sent our son out of the room; and when\nhe paused to breathe, I calmly assured him that he was entirely\nmistaken; I had never once attempted to prejudice his child against\nhim.\n\"I did indeed desire him to _forget_ you,\" I said, \"and especially to\nforget the lessons you taught him; and for that cause, and to lessen\nthe danger of discovery, I own I have generally discouraged his\ninclination to talk about you; but no one can blame me for that, I\nthink.\"\nThe invalid only replied by groaning aloud, and rolling his head on a\npillow in a paroxysm of impatience.\n\"I am in hell, already!\" cried he. \"This cursed thirst is burning my\nheart to ashes! Will _nobody_\u2014\"\nBefore he could finish the sentence I had poured out a glass of some\nacidulated, cooling drink that was on the table, and brought it to him.\nHe drank it greedily, but muttered, as I took away the glass,\u2014\"I\nsuppose you're heaping coals of fire on my head, you think?\"\nNot noticing this speech, I asked if there was anything else I could do\nfor him.\n\"Yes; I'll give you another opportunity of showing your Christian\nmagnanimity,\" sneered he: \"set my pillow straight, and these confounded\nbed-clothes.\" I did so. \"There: now get me another glass of that slop.\"\nI complied. \"This is delightful, isn't it?\" said he with a malicious\ngrin, as I held it to his lips; \"you never hoped for such a glorious\nopportunity?\"\n\"Now, shall I stay with you?\" said I, as I replaced the glass on the\ntable: \"or will you be more quiet if I go and send the nurse?\"\n\"Oh, yes, you're wondrous gentle and obliging! But you've driven me mad\nwith it all!\" responded he, with an impatient toss.\n\"I'll leave you, then,\" said I; and I withdrew, and did not trouble him\nwith my presence again that day, except for a minute or two at a time,\njust to see how he was and what he wanted.\nNext morning the doctor ordered him to be bled; and after that he was\nmore subdued and tranquil. I passed half the day in his room at\ndifferent intervals. My presence did not appear to agitate or irritate\nhim as before, and he accepted my services quietly, without any bitter\nremarks: indeed, he scarcely spoke at all, except to make known his\nwants, and hardly then. But on the morrow, that is to say, in\nproportion as he recovered from the state of exhaustion and\nstupefaction, his ill-nature appeared to revive.\n\"Oh, this sweet revenge!\" cried he, when I had been doing all I could\nto make him comfortable and to remedy the carelessness of his nurse.\n\"And you can enjoy it with such a quiet conscience too, because it's\nall in the way of duty.\"\n\"It is well for me that I _am_ doing my duty,\" said I, with a\nbitterness I could not repress, \"for it is the only comfort I have; and\nthe satisfaction of my own conscience, it seems, is the only reward I\nneed look for!\"\nHe looked rather surprised at the earnestness of my manner.\n\"What reward _did_ you look for?\" he asked.\n\"You will think me a liar if I tell you; but I _did_ hope to benefit\nyou: as well to better your mind as to alleviate your present\nsufferings; but it appears I am to do neither; your own bad spirit will\nnot let me. As far as _you_ are concerned, I have sacrificed my own\nfeelings, and all the little earthly comfort that was left me, to no\npurpose; and every little thing I do for you is ascribed to\nself-righteous malice and refined revenge!\"\n\"It's all very fine, I daresay,\" said he, eyeing me with stupid\namazement; \"and of course I ought to be melted to tears of penitence\nand admiration at the sight of so much generosity and superhuman\ngoodness; but you see I can't manage it. However, pray do me all the\ngood you can, if you do really find any pleasure in it; for you\nperceive I am almost as miserable just now as you need wish to see me.\nSince you came, I confess, I have had better attendance than before,\nfor these wretches neglected me shamefully, and all my old friends seem\nto have fairly forsaken me. I've had a dreadful time of it, I assure\nyou: I sometimes thought I should have died: do you think there's any\nchance?\"\n\"There's always a chance of death; and it is always well to live with\nsuch a chance in view.\"\n\"Yes, yes! but do you think there's any likelihood that this illness\nwill have a fatal termination?\"\n\"I cannot tell; but, supposing it should, how are you prepared to meet\nthe event?\"\n\"Why, the doctor told me I wasn't to think about it, for I was sure to\nget better if I stuck to his regimen and prescriptions.\"\n\"I hope you may, Arthur; but neither the doctor nor I can speak with\ncertainty in such a case; there is internal injury, and it is difficult\nto know to what extent.\"\n\"There now! you want to scare me to death.\"\n\"No; but I don't want to lull you to false security. If a consciousness\nof the uncertainty of life can dispose you to serious and useful\nthoughts, I would not deprive you of the benefit of such reflections,\nwhether you do eventually recover or not. Does the idea of death appal\nyou very much?\"\n\"It's just the only thing I can't bear to think of; so if you've any\u2014\"\n\"But it must come some time,\" interrupted I, \"and if it be years hence,\nit will as certainly overtake you as if it came to-day,\u2014and no doubt be\nas unwelcome then as now, unless you\u2014\"\n\"Oh, hang it! don't torment me with your preachments now, unless you\nwant to kill me outright. I can't stand it, I tell you. I've sufferings\nenough without that. If you think there's danger, save me from it; and\nthen, in gratitude, I'll hear whatever you like to say.\"\nI accordingly dropped the unwelcome topic. And now, Frederick, I think\nI may bring my letter to a close. From these details you may form your\nown judgment of the state of my patient, and of my own position and\nfuture prospects. Let me hear from you soon, and I will write again to\ntell you how we get on; but now that my presence is tolerated, and even\nrequired, in the sick-room, I shall have but little time to spare\nbetween my husband and my son,\u2014for I must not entirely neglect the\nlatter: it would not do to keep him always with Rachel, and I dare not\nleave him for a moment with any of the other servants, or suffer him to\nbe alone, lest he should meet them. If his father get worse, I shall\nask Esther Hargrave to take charge of him for a time, till I have\nreorganised the household at least; but I greatly prefer keeping him\nunder my own eye.\nI find myself in rather a singular position: I am exerting my utmost\nendeavours to promote the recovery and reformation of my husband, and\nif I succeed, what shall I do? My duty, of course,\u2014but how? No matter;\nI can perform the task that is before me now, and God will give me\nstrength to do whatever He requires hereafter. Good-by, dear Frederick.",

It is deplorable to see how\ncompletely his past life has degenerated his once noble constitution,\nand vitiated the whole system of his organization. But the doctor says\nhe may now be considered out of danger, if he will only continue to\nobserve the necessary restrictions. Some stimulating cordials he must\nhave, but they should be judiciously diluted and sparingly used; and I\nfind it very difficult to keep him to this. At first, his extreme dread\nof death rendered the task an easy one; but in proportion as he feels\nhis acute suffering abating, and sees the danger receding, the more\nintractable he becomes. Now, also, his appetite for food is beginning\nto return; and here, too, his long habits of self-indulgence are\ngreatly against him. I watch and restrain him as well as I can, and\noften get bitterly abused for my rigid severity; and sometimes he\ncontrives to elude my vigilance, and sometimes acts in opposition to my\nwill. But he is now so completely reconciled to my attendance in\ngeneral that he is never satisfied when I am not by his side. I am\nobliged to be a little stiff with him sometimes, or he would make a\ncomplete slave of me; and I know it would be unpardonable weakness to\ngive up all other interests for him. I have the servants to overlook,\nand my little Arthur to attend to,\u2014and my own health too, all of which\nwould be entirely neglected were I to satisfy his exorbitant demands. I\ndo not generally sit up at night, for I think the nurse who has made it\nher business is better qualified for such undertakings than I am;\u2014but\nstill, an unbroken night's rest is what I but seldom enjoy, and never\ncan venture to reckon upon; for my patient makes no scruple of calling\nme up at an hour when his wants or his fancies require my presence. But\nhe is manifestly afraid of my displeasure; and if at one time he tries\nmy patience by his unreasonable exactions, and fretful complaints and\nreproaches, at another he depresses me by his abject submission and\ndeprecatory self-abasement when he fears he has gone too far. But all\nthis I can readily pardon; I know it is chiefly the result of his\nenfeebled frame and disordered nerves. What annoys me the most, is his\noccasional attempts at affectionate fondness that I can neither credit\nnor return; not that I hate him: his sufferings and my own laborious\ncare have given him some claim to my regard\u2014to my affection even, if he\nwould only be quiet and sincere, and content to let things remain as\nthey are; but the more he tries to conciliate me, the more I shrink\nfrom him and from the future.\n\"Helen, what do you mean to do when I get well?\" he asked this morning.\n\"Will you run away again?\"\n\"It entirely depends upon your own conduct.\"\n\"Oh, I'll be very good.\"\n\"But if I find it necessary to leave you, Arthur, I shall not 'run\naway': you know I have your own promise that I may go whenever I\nplease, and take my son with me.\"\n\"Oh, but you shall have no cause.\" And then followed a variety of\nprofessions, which I rather coldly checked.\n\"Will you not forgive me, then?\" said he.\n\"Yes,\u2014I _have_ forgiven you: but I know you cannot love me as you once\ndid\u2014and I should be very sorry if you were to, for I could not pretend\nto return it: so let us drop the subject, and never recur to it again.\nBy what I _have_ done for you, you may judge of what I _will_ do\u2014if it\nbe not incompatible with the higher duty I owe to my son (higher,\nbecause he never forfeited his claims, and because I hope to do more\ngood to him than I can ever do to you); and if you wish me to feel\nkindly towards you, it is _deeds_ not _words_ which must purchase my\naffection and esteem.\"\nHis sole reply to this was a slight grimace, and a scarcely perceptible\nshrug. Alas, unhappy man! words, with him, are so much cheaper than\ndeeds; it was as if I had said, \"Pounds, not pence, must buy the\narticle you want.\" And then he sighed a querulous, self-commiserating\nsigh, as if in pure regret that he, the loved and courted of so many\nworshippers, should be now abandoned to the mercy of a harsh, exacting,\ncold-hearted woman like that, and even glad of what kindness she chose\nto bestow.",

The Millwards and\nthe Wilsons should see with their own eyes the bright sun bursting from\nthe cloud\u2014and they should be scorched and dazzled by its beams;\u2014and my\nown friends too should see it\u2014they whose suspicions had been such gall\nand wormwood to my soul. To effect this I had only to drop the seed\ninto the ground, and it would soon become a stately, branching herb: a\nfew words to my mother and sister, I knew, would suffice to spread the\nnews throughout the whole neighbourhood, without any further exertion\non my part.\nRose was delighted; and as soon as I had told her all I thought\nproper\u2014which was all I affected to know\u2014she flew with alacrity to put\non her bonnet and shawl, and hasten to carry the glad tidings to the\nMillwards and Wilsons\u2014glad tidings, I suspect, to none but herself and\nMary Millward\u2014that steady, sensible girl, whose sterling worth had been\nso quickly perceived and duly valued by the supposed Mrs. Graham, in\nspite of her plain outside; and who, on her part, had been better able\nto see and appreciate that lady's true character and qualities than the\nbrightest genius among them.\nAs I may never have occasion to mention her again, I may as well tell\nyou here that she was at this time privately engaged to Richard\nWilson\u2014a secret, I believe, to every one but themselves. That worthy\nstudent was now at Cambridge, where his most exemplary conduct and his\ndiligent perseverance in the pursuit of learning carried him safely\nthrough, and eventually brought him with hard-earned honours, and an\nuntarnished reputation, to the close of his collegiate career. In due\ntime he became Mr. Millward's first and only curate\u2014for that\ngentleman's declining years forced him at last to acknowledge that the\nduties of his extensive parish were a little too much for those vaunted\nenergies which he was wont to boast over his younger and less active\nbrethren of the cloth. This was what the patient, faithful lovers had\nprivately planned and quietly waited for years ago; and in due time\nthey were united, to the astonishment of the little world they lived\nin, that had long since declared them both born to single blessedness;\naffirming it impossible that the pale, retiring bookworm should ever\nsummon courage to seek a wife, or be able to obtain one if he did, and\nequally impossible that the plain-looking, plain-dealing, unattractive,\nunconciliating Miss Millward should ever find a husband.\nThey still continued to live at the vicarage, the lady dividing her\ntime between her father, her husband, and their poor parishioners,\u2014and\nsubsequently her rising family; and now that the Reverend Michael\nMillward has been gathered to his fathers, full of years and honours,\nthe Reverend Richard Wilson has succeeded him to the vicarage of\nLindenhope, greatly to the satisfaction of its inhabitants, who had so\nlong tried and fully proved his merits, and those of his excellent and\nwell-loved partner.\nIf you are interested in the after fate of that lady's sister, I can\nonly tell you\u2014what perhaps you have heard from another quarter\u2014that\nsome twelve or thirteen years ago she relieved the happy couple of her\npresence by marrying a wealthy tradesman of L\u2014\u2014; and I don't envy him\nhis bargain. I fear she leads him a rather uncomfortable life, though,\nhappily, he is too dull to perceive the extent of his misfortune. I\nhave little enough to do with her myself: we have not met for many\nyears; but, I am well assured, she has not yet forgotten or forgiven\neither her former lover, or the lady whose superior qualities first\nopened his eyes to the folly of his boyish attachment.\nAs for Richard Wilson's sister, she, having been wholly unable to\nrecapture Mr. Lawrence, or obtain any partner rich and elegant enough\nto suit her ideas of what the husband of Jane Wilson ought to be, is\nyet in single blessedness. Shortly after the death of her mother she\nwithdrew the light of her presence from Ryecote Farm, finding it\nimpossible any longer to endure the rough manners and unsophisticated\nhabits of her honest brother Robert and his worthy wife, or the idea of\nbeing identified with such vulgar people in the eyes of the world, and\ntook lodgings in \u2014\u2014 the county town, where she lived, and still lives,\nI suppose, in a kind of close-fisted, cold, uncomfortable gentility,\ndoing no good to others, and but little to herself; spending her days\nin fancy-work and scandal; referring frequently to her \"brother the\nvicar,\" and her \"sister, the vicar's lady,\" but never to her brother\nthe farmer and her sister the farmer's wife; seeing as much company as\nshe can without too much expense, but loving no one and beloved by\nnone\u2014a cold-hearted, supercilious, keenly, insidiously censorious old",

We seldom _talked_ about Mrs. Huntingdon; but yet we never met\nwithout mentioning her, for I never sought his company but with the\nhope of hearing something about her, and he never sought mine at all,\nbecause he saw me often enough without. But I always began to talk of\nother things, and waited first to see if _he_ would introduce the\nsubject. If he did not, I would casually ask, \"Have you heard from your\nsister lately?\" If he said \"No,\" the matter was dropped: if he said\n\"Yes,\" I would venture to inquire, \"How is she?\" but never \"How is her\nhusband?\" though I might be burning to know; because I had not the\nhypocrisy to profess any anxiety for his recovery, and I had not the\nface to express any desire for a contrary result. Had I any such\ndesire?\u2014I fear I must plead guilty; but since you have heard my\nconfession, you must hear my justification as well\u2014a few of the\nexcuses, at least, wherewith I sought to pacify my own accusing\nconscience.\nIn the first place, you see, his life did harm to others, and evidently\nno good to himself; and though I wished it to terminate, I would not\nhave hastened its close if, by the lifting of a finger, I could have\ndone so, or if a spirit had whispered in my ear that a single effort of\nthe will would be enough,\u2014unless, indeed, I had the power to exchange\nhim for some other victim of the grave, whose life might be of service\nto his race, and whose death would be lamented by his friends. But was\nthere any harm in wishing that, among the many thousands whose souls\nwould certainly be required of them before the year was over, this\nwretched mortal might be one? I thought not; and therefore I wished\nwith all my heart that it might please heaven to remove him to a better\nworld, or if that might not be, still to take him out of this; for if\nhe were unfit to answer the summons now, after a warning sickness, and\nwith such an angel by his side, it seemed but too certain that he never\nwould be\u2014that, on the contrary, returning health would bring returning\nlust and villainy, and as he grew more certain of recovery, more\naccustomed to her generous goodness, his feelings would become more\ncallous, his heart more flinty and impervious to her persuasive\narguments\u2014but God knew best. Meantime, however, I could not but be\nanxious for the result of His decrees; knowing, as I did, that (leaving\nmyself entirely out of the question), however Helen might feel\ninterested in her husband's welfare, however she might deplore his\nfate, still while he lived she must be miserable.",

In vain had she remonstrated, in vain she had\nmingled his wine with water: her arguments and entreaties were a\nnuisance, her interference was an insult so intolerable that, at\nlength, on finding she had covertly diluted the pale port that was\nbrought him, he threw the bottle out of the window, swearing he would\nnot be cheated like a baby, ordered the butler, on pain of instant\ndismissal, to bring a bottle of the strongest wine in the cellar, and\naffirming that he should have been well long ago if he had been let to\nhave his own way, but she wanted to keep him weak in order that she\nmight have him under her thumb\u2014but, by the Lord Harry, he would have no\nmore humbug\u2014seized a glass in one hand and the bottle in the other, and\nnever rested till he had drunk it dry. Alarming symptoms were the\nimmediate result of this \"imprudence,\" as she mildly termed it\u2014symptoms\nwhich had rather increased than diminished since; and this was the\ncause of her delay in writing to her brother. Every former feature of\nhis malady had returned with augmented virulence: the slight external\nwound, half healed, had broken out afresh; internal inflammation had\ntaken place, which might terminate fatally if not soon removed. Of\ncourse, the wretched sufferer's temper was not improved by this\ncalamity\u2014in fact, I suspect it was well nigh insupportable, though his\nkind nurse did not complain; but she said she had been obliged at last\nto give her son in charge to Esther Hargrave, as her presence was so\nconstantly required in the sick-room that she could not possibly attend\nto him herself; and though the child had begged to be allowed to\ncontinue with her there, and to help her to nurse his papa, and though\nshe had no doubt he would have been very good and quiet, she could not\nthink of subjecting his young and tender feelings to the sight of so\nmuch suffering, or of allowing him to witness his father's impatience,\nor hear the dreadful language he was wont to use in his paroxysms of\npain or irritation.\nThe latter (continued she) most deeply regrets the step that has\noccasioned his relapse; but, as usual, he throws the blame upon me. If\nI had reasoned with him like a rational creature, he says, it never\nwould have happened; but to be treated like a baby or a fool was enough\nto put any man past his patience, and drive him to assert his\nindependence even at the sacrifice of his own interest. He forgets how\noften I had _reasoned_ him \"past his patience\" before. He appears to be\nsensible of his danger; but nothing can induce him to behold it in the",

The other night, while I was waiting on him, and just as\nI had brought him a draught to assuage his burning thirst, he observed,\nwith a return of his former sarcastic bitterness, \"Yes, you're mighty\nattentive _now!_ I suppose there's _nothing_ you wouldn't do for me\nnow?\"\n\"You know,\" said I, a little surprised at his manner, \"that I am\nwilling to do anything I can to relieve you.\"\n\"Yes, _now_, my immaculate angel; but when once you have secured your\nreward, and find yourself safe in heaven, and me howling in hell-fire,\ncatch you lifting a finger to serve me _then!_ No, you'll look\ncomplacently on, and not so much as dip the tip of your finger in water\nto cool my tongue!\"\n\"If so, it will be because of the great gulf over which I cannot pass;\nand if I _could_ look complacently on in such a case, it would be only\nfrom the assurance that you were being purified from your sins, and\nfitted to enjoy the happiness I felt.\u2014But are you _determined_, Arthur,\nthat I shall not meet you in heaven?\"\n\"Humph! What should I do there, I should like to know?\"\n\"Indeed, I cannot tell; and I fear it is too certain that your tastes\nand feelings must be widely altered before you can have any enjoyment\nthere. But do you prefer sinking, without an effort, into the state of\ntorment you picture to yourself?\"\n\"Oh, it's all a fable,\" said he, contemptuously.\n\"Are you sure, Arthur? are you _quite_ sure? Because, if there is any\ndoubt, and if you _should_ find yourself mistaken after all, when it is\ntoo late to turn\u2014\"\n\"It would be rather awkward, to be sure,\" said he; \"but don't bother me\nnow\u2014I'm not going to die yet. I can't and won't,\" he added vehemently,\nas if suddenly struck with the appalling aspect of that terrible event.\n\"Helen, you _must_ save me!\" And he earnestly seized my hand, and\nlooked into my face with such imploring eagerness that my heart bled\nfor him, and I could not speak for tears.\n* * * * *\nThe next letter brought intelligence that the malady was fast\nincreasing; and the poor sufferer's horror of death was still more\ndistressing than his impatience of bodily pain. _All_ his friends had\nnot forsaken him; for Mr. Hattersley, hearing of his danger, had come\nto see him from his distant home in the north. His wife had accompanied\nhim, as much for the pleasure of seeing her dear friend, from whom she\nhad been parted so long, as to visit her mother and sister.\nMrs. Huntingdon expressed herself glad to see Milicent once more, and\npleased to behold her so happy and well. She is now at the Grove,\ncontinued the letter, but she often calls to see me. Mr. Hattersley\nspends much of his time at Arthur's bed-side. With more good feeling\nthan I gave him credit for, he evinces considerable sympathy for his\nunhappy friend, and is far more willing than able to comfort him.\nSometimes he tries to joke and laugh with him, but that will not do;\nsometimes he endeavours to cheer him with talk about old times, and\nthis at one time may serve to divert the sufferer from his own sad\nthoughts; at another, it will only plunge him into deeper melancholy\nthan before; and then Hattersley is confounded, and knows not what to\nsay, unless it be a timid suggestion that the clergyman might be sent\nfor. But Arthur will never consent to that: he knows he has rejected\nthe clergyman's well-meant admonitions with scoffing levity at other\ntimes, and cannot dream of turning to him for consolation now.\nMr. Hattersley sometimes offers his services instead of mine, but\nArthur will not let me go: that strange whim still increases, as his\nstrength declines\u2014the fancy to have me always by his side. I hardly\never leave him, except to go into the next room, where I sometimes\nsnatch an hour or so of sleep when he is quiet; but even then the door\nis left ajar, that he may know me to be within call. I am with him now,\nwhile I write, and I fear my occupation annoys him; though I frequently\nbreak off to attend to him, and though Mr. Hattersley is also by his\nside. That gentleman came, as he said, to beg a holiday for me, that I\nmight have a run in the park, this fine frosty morning, with Milicent\nand Esther and little Arthur, whom he had driven over to see me. Our\npoor invalid evidently felt it a heartless proposition, and would have\nfelt it still more heartless in me to accede to it. I therefore said I\nwould only go and speak to them a minute, and then come back. I did but\nexchange a few words with them, just outside the portico, inhaling the\nfresh, bracing air as I stood, and then, resisting the earnest and\neloquent entreaties of all three to stay a little longer, and join them\nin a walk round the garden, I tore myself away and returned to my\npatient. I had not been absent five minutes, but he reproached me\nbitterly for my levity and neglect. His friend espoused my cause.\n\"Nay, nay, Huntingdon,\" said he, \"you're too hard upon her; she must\nhave food and sleep, and a mouthful of fresh air now and then, or she\ncan't stand it, I tell you. Look at her, man! she's worn to a shadow\nalready.\"\n\"What are her sufferings to mine?\" said the poor invalid. \"You don't\ngrudge me these attentions, do you, Helen?\"\n\"No, Arthur, if I could really serve you by them. I would give my life\nto save you, if I might.\"\n\"Would you, _indeed?_ No!\"\n\"Most willingly I would.\"\n\"Ah! that's because you think yourself more fit to die!\"\nThere was a painful pause. He was evidently plunged in gloomy\nreflections; but while I pondered for something to say that might\nbenefit without alarming him, Hattersley, whose mind had been pursuing\nalmost the same course, broke silence with, \"I say, Huntingdon, I\n_would_ send for a parson of some sort: if you didn't like the vicar,\nyou know, you could have his curate, or somebody else.\"\n\"No; none of them can benefit me if _she_ can't,\" was the answer. And\nthe tears gushed from his eyes as he earnestly exclaimed, \"Oh, Helen,\nif I had listened to you, it never would have come to this! and if I\nhad heard you long ago\u2014oh, God! how different it would have been!\"\n\"Hear me now, then, Arthur,\" said I, gently pressing his hand.\n\"It's too late now,\" said he despondingly. And after that another\nparoxysm of pain came on; and then his mind began to wander, and we\nfeared his death was approaching: but an opiate was administered: his\nsufferings began to abate, he gradually became more composed, and at\nlength sank into a kind of slumber. He has been quieter since; and now\nHattersley has left him, expressing a hope that he shall find him\nbetter when he calls to-morrow.\n\"Perhaps I _may_ recover,\" he replied; \"who knows? This may have been\nthe crisis. What do _you_ think, Helen?\"\nUnwilling to depress him, I gave the most cheering answer I could, but\nstill recommended him to prepare for the possibility of what I inly\nfeared was but too certain. But he was determined to hope. Shortly\nafter he relapsed into a kind of doze, but now he groans again.\nThere is a change. Suddenly he called me to his side, with such a\nstrange, excited manner, that I feared he was delirious, but he was\nnot. \"That _was_ the crisis, Helen!\" said he, delightedly. \"I had an\ninfernal pain here\u2014it is quite gone now. I never was so easy since the\nfall\u2014quite gone, by heaven!\" and he clasped and kissed my hand in the\nvery fulness of his heart; but finding I did not participate in his\njoy, he quickly flung it from him, and bitterly cursed my coldness and\ninsensibility. How could I reply? Kneeling beside him, I took his hand\nand fondly pressed it to my lips\u2014for the first time since our\nseparation\u2014and told him, as well as tears would let me speak, that it\nwas not _that_ that kept me silent: it was the fear that this sudden\ncessation of pain was not so favourable a symptom as he supposed. I\nimmediately sent for the doctor: we are now anxiously awaiting him. I\nwill tell you what he says. There is still the same freedom from pain,\nthe same deadness to all sensation where the suffering was most acute.\nMy worst fears are realised: mortification has commenced. The doctor\nhas told him there is no hope. No words can describe his anguish. I can\nwrite no more.",

The\nsufferer was fast approaching dissolution\u2014dragged almost to the verge\nof that awful chasm he trembled to contemplate, from which no agony of\nprayers or tears could save him. Nothing could comfort him now;\nHattersley's rough attempts at consolation were utterly in vain. The\nworld was nothing to him: life and all its interests, its petty cares\nand transient pleasures, were a cruel mockery. To talk of the past was\nto torture him with vain remorse; to refer to the future was to\nincrease his anguish; and yet to be silent was to leave him a prey to\nhis own regrets and apprehensions. Often he dwelt with shuddering\nminuteness on the fate of his perishing clay\u2014the slow, piecemeal\ndissolution already invading his frame: the shroud, the coffin, the\ndark, lonely grave, and all the horrors of corruption.\n\"If I try,\" said his afflicted wife, \"to divert him from these\nthings\u2014to raise his thoughts to higher themes, it is no better:\u2014'Worse\nand worse!' he groans. 'If there be really life beyond the tomb, and\njudgment after death, how _can_ I face it?'\u2014I cannot do him any good;\nhe will neither be enlightened, nor roused, nor comforted by anything I\nsay; and yet he clings to me with unrelenting pertinacity\u2014with a kind\nof childish desperation, as if _I_ could save him from the fate he\ndreads. He keeps me night and day beside him. He is holding my left\nhand now, while I write; he has held it thus for hours: sometimes\nquietly, with his pale face upturned to mine: sometimes clutching my\narm with violence\u2014the big drops starting from his forehead at the\nthoughts of what he sees, or thinks he sees, before him. If I withdraw\nmy hand for a moment it distresses him.\n\"'Stay with me, Helen,' he says; 'let me hold you so: it seems as if\nharm could not reach me while you are here. But death _will_ come\u2014it is\ncoming now\u2014fast, fast!\u2014and\u2014oh, if I _could_ believe there was nothing\nafter!'\n\"'Don't try to believe it, Arthur; there is joy and glory after, if you\nwill but try to reach it!'\n\"'What, for _me?_' he said, with something like a laugh. 'Are we not to\nbe judged according to the deeds done in the body? Where's the use of a\nprobationary existence, if a man may spend it as he pleases, just\ncontrary to God's decrees, and then go to heaven with the best\u2014if the\nvilest sinner may win the reward of the holiest saint, by merely\nsaying, 'I repent!'\"\n\"'But if you _sincerely_ repent\u2014'\n\"'I _can't_ repent; I only fear.'\n\"'You only regret the past for its consequences to yourself?'\n\"'Just so\u2014except that I'm sorry to have wronged you, Nell, because\nyou're so good to me.'\n\"'Think of the goodness of God, and you cannot but be grieved to have\noffended Him.'\n\"'What _is_ God?\u2014I cannot see Him or hear Him.\u2014God is only an idea.'\n\"'God is Infinite Wisdom, and Power, and Goodness\u2014and LOVE; but if this\nidea is too vast for your human faculties\u2014if your mind loses itself in\nits overwhelming infinitude, fix it on Him who condescended to take our\nnature upon Him, who was raised to heaven even in His glorified human\nbody, in whom the fulness of the Godhead shines.'\n\"But he only shook his head and sighed. Then, in another paroxysm of\nshuddering horror, he tightened his grasp on my hand and arm, and,\ngroaning and lamenting, still clung to me with that wild, desperate\nearnestness so harrowing to my soul, because I know I cannot help him.\nI did my best to soothe and comfort him.\n\"'Death is so terrible,' he cried, 'I cannot bear it! _You_ don't know,\nHelen\u2014you can't imagine what it is, because you haven't it before you!\nand when I'm buried, you'll return to your old ways and be as happy as\never, and all the world will go on just as busy and merry as if I had\nnever been; while I\u2014' He burst into tears.\n\"'You needn't let _that_ distress you,' I said; 'we shall all follow\nyou soon enough.'\n\"'I wish to God I could take you with me now!' he exclaimed: 'you\nshould plead for me.'\n\"'No man can deliver his brother, nor make agreement unto God for him,'\nI replied: 'it cost more to redeem their souls\u2014it cost the blood of an\nincarnate God, perfect and sinless in Himself, to redeem us from the\nbondage of the evil one:\u2014let _Him_ plead for you.'\n\"But I seem to speak in vain. He does not now, as formerly, laugh these\nblessed truths to scorn: but still he cannot trust, or will not\ncomprehend them. He cannot linger long. He suffers dreadfully, and so\ndo those that wait upon him. But I will not harass you with further\ndetails: I have said enough, I think, to convince you that I did well\nto go to him.\"\n* * * * *\nPoor, poor Helen! dreadful indeed her trials must have been! And I\ncould do nothing to lessen them\u2014nay, it almost seemed as if I had\nbrought them upon her myself by my own secret desires; and whether I\nlooked at her husband's sufferings or her own, it seemed almost like a\njudgment upon myself for having cherished such a wish.\nThe next day but one there came another letter. That too was put into\nmy hands without a remark, and these are its contents:\u2014\nDec. 5th.\nHe is gone at last. I sat beside him all night, with my hand fast\nlocked in his, watching the changes of his features and listening to\nhis failing breath. He had been silent a long time, and I thought he\nwould never speak again, when he murmured, faintly but\ndistinctly,\u2014\"Pray for me, Helen!\"\n\"I do pray for you, every hour and every minute, Arthur; but you must\npray for yourself.\"\nHis lips moved, but emitted no sound;\u2014then his looks became unsettled;\nand, from the incoherent, half-uttered words that escaped him from time\nto time, supposing him to be now unconscious, I gently disengaged my\nhand from his, intending to steal away for a breath of air, for I was\nalmost ready to faint; but a convulsive movement of the fingers, and a\nfaintly whispered \"Don't leave me!\" immediately recalled me: I took his\nhand again, and held it till he was no more\u2014and then I fainted. It was\nnot grief; it was exhaustion, that, till then, I had been enabled\nsuccessfully to combat. Oh, Frederick! none can imagine the miseries,\nbodily and mental, of that death-bed! How could I endure to think that\nthat poor trembling soul was hurried away to everlasting torment? it\nwould drive me mad. But, thank God, I have hope\u2014not only from a vague\ndependence on the possibility that penitence and pardon might have\nreached him at the last, but from the blessed confidence that, through\nwhatever purging fires the erring spirit may be doomed to pass\u2014whatever\nfate awaits it\u2014still it is not lost, and God, who hateth nothing that\nHe hath made, _will_ bless it in the end!\nHis body will be consigned on Thursday to that dark grave he so much\ndreaded; but the coffin must be closed as soon as possible. If you will\nattend the funeral, come quickly, for I need help.\nHELEN HUNTINGDON.",

But instead of boring you with\nmy chagrin, my expectations and disappointments, my fluctuations of\ndull despondency and flickering hope, my varying resolutions, now to\ndrop it, and now to persevere\u2014now to make a bold push, and now to let\nthings pass and patiently abide my time,\u2014I will employ myself in\nsettling the business of one or two of the characters introduced in the\ncourse of this narrative, whom I may not have occasion to mention\nagain.\nSome time before Mr. Huntingdon's death Lady Lowborough eloped with\nanother gallant to the Continent, where, having lived a while in\nreckless gaiety and dissipation, they quarrelled and parted. She went\ndashing on for a season, but years came and money went: she sunk, at\nlength, in difficulty and debt, disgrace and misery; and died at last,\nas I have heard, in penury, neglect, and utter wretchedness. But this\nmight be only a report: she may be living yet for anything I or any of\nher relatives or former acquaintances can tell; for they have all lost\nsight of her long years ago, and would as thoroughly forget her if they\ncould. Her husband, however, upon this second misdemeanour, immediately\nsought and obtained a divorce, and, not long after, married again. It\nwas well he did, for Lord Lowborough, morose and moody as he seemed,\nwas not the man for a bachelor's life. No public interests, no\nambitious projects, or active pursuits,\u2014or ties of friendship even (if\nhe had had any friends), could compensate to him for the absence of\ndomestic comforts and endearments. He had a son and a nominal daughter,\nit is true, but they too painfully reminded him of their mother, and\nthe unfortunate little Annabella was a source of perpetual bitterness\nto his soul. He had obliged himself to treat her with paternal\nkindness: he had forced himself not to hate her, and even, perhaps, to\nfeel some degree of kindly regard for her, at last, in return for her\nartless and unsuspecting attachment to himself; but the bitterness of\nhis self-condemnation for his inward feelings towards that innocent\nbeing, his constant struggles to subdue the evil promptings of his\nnature (for it was not a generous one), though partly guessed at by\nthose who knew him, could be known to God and his own heart alone;\u2014so\nalso was the hardness of his conflicts with the temptation to return to\nthe vice of his youth, and seek oblivion for past calamities, and\ndeadness to the present misery of a blighted heart a joyless,\nfriendless life, and a morbidly disconsolate mind, by yielding again to\nthat insidious foe to health, and sense, and virtue, which had so\ndeplorably enslaved and degraded him before.\nThe second object of his choice was widely different from the first.\nSome wondered at his taste; some even ridiculed it\u2014but in this their\nfolly was more apparent than his. The lady was about his own\nage\u2014_i.e._, between thirty and forty\u2014remarkable neither for beauty, nor\nwealth, nor brilliant accomplishments; nor any other thing that I ever\nheard of, except genuine good sense, unswerving integrity, active\npiety, warm-hearted benevolence, and a fund of cheerful spirits. These\nqualities, however, as you may readily imagine, combined to render her\nan excellent mother to the children, and an invaluable wife to his\nlordship. _He_, with his usual self-depreciation, thought her a world\ntoo good for him, and while he wondered at the kindness of Providence\nin conferring such a gift upon him, and even at her taste in preferring\nhim to other men, he did his best to reciprocate the good she did him,\nand so far succeeded that she was, and I believe still is, one of the\nhappiest and fondest wives in England; and all who question the good\ntaste of either partner may be thankful if _their_ respective\nselections afford them half the genuine satisfaction in the end, or\nrepay their preference with affection half as lasting and sincere.",

I had been to call upon her father,\u2014a sacrifice to civility\nundertaken entirely to please my mother, not myself, for I hated to go\nnear the house; not merely on account of my antipathy to the once so\nbewitching Eliza, but because I had not half forgiven the old gentleman\nhimself for his ill opinion of Mrs. Huntingdon; for though now\nconstrained to acknowledge himself mistaken in his former judgment, he\nstill maintained that she had done wrong to leave her husband; it was a\nviolation of her sacred duties as a wife, and a tempting of Providence\nby laying herself open to temptation; and nothing short of bodily\nill-usage (and that of no trifling nature) could excuse such a step\u2014nor\neven that, for in such a case she ought to appeal to the laws for\nprotection.

Gracious, Mr. Markham, are you going to faint? Oh,\nmercy! shall I call this man? Here, Jacob\u2014\" But checking the word on\nher lips, I seized her arm and gave it, I think, a pretty severe\nsqueeze, for she shrank into herself with a faint cry of pain or\nterror; but the spirit within her was not subdued: instantly rallying,\nshe continued, with well-feigned concern, \"What can I do for you? Will\nyou have some water\u2014some brandy? I daresay they have some in the\npublic-house down there, if you'll let me run.\"\n\"Have done with this nonsense!\" cried I, sternly. She looked\nconfounded\u2014almost frightened again, for a moment. \"You know I hate such\njests,\" I continued.\n\"_Jests_ indeed! I wasn't _jesting!_\"\n\"You were laughing, at all events; and I don't like to be laughed at,\"\nreturned I, making violent efforts to speak with proper dignity and\ncomposure, and to say nothing but what was coherent and sensible. \"And\nsince you are in such a merry mood, Miss Eliza, you must be good enough\ncompany for yourself; and therefore I shall leave you to finish your\nwalk alone\u2014for, now I think of it, I have business elsewhere; so\ngood-evening.\"\nWith that I left her (smothering her malicious laughter) and turned\naside into the fields, springing up the bank, and pushing through the\nnearest gap in the hedge. Determined at once to prove the truth\u2014or\nrather the falsehood\u2014of her story, I hastened to Woodford as fast as my\nlegs could carry me; first veering round by a circuitous course, but\nthe moment I was out of sight of my fair tormentor cutting away across\nthe country, just as a bird might fly, over pasture-land, and fallow,\nand stubble, and lane, clearing hedges and ditches and hurdles, till I\ncame to the young squire's gates. Never till now had I known the full\nfervour of my love\u2014the full strength of my hopes, not wholly crushed\neven in my hours of deepest despondency, always tenaciously clinging to\nthe thought that one day she might be mine, or, if not that, at least\nthat something of my memory, some slight remembrance of our friendship\nand our love, would be for ever cherished in her heart. I marched up to\nthe door, determined, if I saw the master, to question him boldly\nconcerning his sister, to wait and hesitate no longer, but cast false\ndelicacy and stupid pride behind my back, and know my fate at once.\n\"Is Mr. Lawrence at home?\" I eagerly asked of the servant that opened\nthe door.\n\"No, sir, master went yesterday,\" replied he, looking very alert.\n\"Went where?\"\n\"To Grassdale, sir\u2014wasn't you aware, sir? He's very close, is master,\"\nsaid the fellow, with a foolish, simpering grin. \"I suppose, sir\u2014\"\nBut I turned and left him, without waiting to hear what he supposed. I\nwas not going to stand there to expose my tortured feelings to the\ninsolent laughter and impertinent curiosity of a fellow like that.",

I\napproached the little rural church\u2014but lo! there stood a train of\ncarriages before it; it needed not the white favours bedecking the\nservants and horses, nor the merry voices of the village idlers\nassembled to witness the show, to apprise me that there was a wedding\nwithin. I ran in among them, demanding, with breathless eagerness, had\nthe ceremony long commenced? They only gaped and stared. In my\ndesperation, I pushed past them, and was about to enter the churchyard\ngate, when a group of ragged urchins, that had been hanging like bees\nto the window, suddenly dropped off and made a rush for the porch,\nvociferating in the uncouth dialect of their country something which\nsignified, \"It's over\u2014they're coming out!\"\nIf Eliza Millward had seen me then she might indeed have been\ndelighted. I grasped the gate-post for support, and stood intently\ngazing towards the door to take my last look on my soul's delight, my\nfirst on that detested mortal who had torn her from my heart, and\ndoomed her, I was certain, to a life of misery and hollow, vain\nrepining\u2014for what happiness could she enjoy with him? I did not wish to\nshock her with my presence now, but I had not power to move away. Forth\ncame the bride and bridegroom. Him I saw not; I had eyes for none but\nher. A long veil shrouded half her graceful form, but did not hide it;\nI could see that while she carried her head erect, her eyes were bent\nupon the ground, and her face and neck were suffused with a crimson\nblush; but every feature was radiant with smiles, and gleaming through\nthe misty whiteness of her veil were clusters of golden ringlets! Oh,\nheavens! it was _not_ my Helen! The first glimpse made me start\u2014but my\neyes were darkened with exhaustion and despair. Dare I trust them?\n\"Yes\u2014it _is_ not she! It was a younger, slighter, rosier beauty\u2014lovely\nindeed, but with far less dignity and depth of soul\u2014without that\nindefinable grace, that keenly _spiritual_ yet gentle charm, that\nineffable power to attract and subjugate the heart\u2014_my_ heart at least.\nI looked at the bridegroom\u2014it was Frederick Lawrence! I wiped away the\ncold drops that were trickling down my forehead, and stepped back as he\napproached; but, his eyes fell upon me, and he knew me, altered as my\nappearance must have been.\n\"Is that you, Markham?\" said he, startled and confounded at the\napparition\u2014perhaps, too, at the wildness of my looks.\n\"Yes, Lawrence; is that you?\" I mustered the presence of mind to reply.\nHe smiled and coloured, as if half-proud and half-ashamed of his\nidentity; and if he had reason to be proud of the sweet lady on his\narm, he had no less cause to be ashamed of having concealed his good\nfortune so long.\n\"Allow me to introduce you to my bride,\" said he, endeavouring to hide\nhis embarrassment by an assumption of careless gaiety. \"Esther, this is\nMr. Markham; my friend Markham, Mrs. Lawrence, late Miss Hargrave.\"",

But what brought\nyou here, then, if you received no information?\"\nIt was now _my_ turn to be confounded; but the young lady, who had been\nbusily patting the snow with her foot during our short sotto-voce\ncolloquy, very opportunely came to my assistance by pinching her\ncompanion's arm and whispering a suggestion that his friend should be\ninvited to step into the carriage and go with them; it being scarcely\nagreeable to stand there among so many gazers, and keeping their\nfriends waiting into the bargain.\n\"And so cold as it is too!\" said he, glancing with dismay at her slight\ndrapery, and immediately handing her into the carriage. \"Markham, will\nyou come? We are going to Paris, but we can drop you anywhere between\nthis and Dover.\"\n\"No, thank you. Good-by\u2014I needn't wish you a pleasant journey; but I\nshall expect a very handsome apology, some time, mind, and scores of\nletters, before we meet again.\"\nHe shook my hand, and hastened to take his place beside his lady. This\nwas no time or place for explanation or discourse: we had already stood\nlong enough to excite the wonder of the village sight-seers, and\nperhaps the wrath of the attendant bridal party; though, of course, all\nthis passed in a much shorter time than I have taken to relate, or even\nthan you will take to read it.

What did he think? Could he grudge such happiness to his dear\nsister and his friend as he now felt himself? At _such_ a moment it was\nimpossible. The contrast between her fate and his _must_ darken his\nbliss for a time. Perhaps, too, he thought of me: perhaps he regretted\nthe part he had had in preventing our union, by omitting to help us, if\nnot by actually plotting against us. I exonerated him from _that_\ncharge now, and deeply lamented my former ungenerous suspicions; but he\n_had_ wronged us, still\u2014I hoped, I trusted that he had.

Mrs. Maxwell then withdrew to take off her things.\nHelen immediately pushed the book from her, and after silently\nsurveying her son, his friend, and his dog for a few moments, she\ndismissed the former from the room under pretence of wishing him to\nfetch his last new book to show me. The child obeyed with alacrity; but\nI continued caressing the dog. The silence might have lasted till its\nmaster's return, had it depended on me to break it; but, in half a\nminute or less, my hostess impatiently rose, and, taking her former\nstation on the rug between me and the chimney corner, earnestly\nexclaimed\u2014\n\"Gilbert, what _is_ the matter with you?\u2014why are you so changed? It is\na very indiscreet question, I know,\" she hastened to add: \"perhaps a\nvery rude one\u2014don't answer it if you think so\u2014but I hate mysteries and\nconcealments.\"\n\"I am not changed, Helen\u2014unfortunately I am as keen and passionate as\never\u2014it is not I, it is circumstances that are changed.\"\n\"What circumstances? _Do_ tell me!\" Her cheek was blanched with the\nvery anguish of anxiety\u2014could it be with the fear that I had rashly\npledged my faith to another?\n\"I'll tell you at once,\" said I. \"I will confess that I came here for\nthe purpose of seeing you (not without some monitory misgivings at my\nown presumption, and fears that I should be as little welcome as\nexpected when I came), but I did not know that this estate was yours\nuntil enlightened on the subject of your inheritance by the\nconversation of two fellow-passengers in the last stage of my journey;\nand then I saw at once the folly of the hopes I had cherished, and the\nmadness of retaining them a moment longer; and though I alighted at\nyour gates, I determined not to enter within them; I lingered a few\nminutes to see the place, but was fully resolved to return to M\u2014\u2014\nwithout seeing its mistress.\"\n\"And if my aunt and I had not been just returning from our morning\ndrive, I should have seen and heard no more of you?\"\n\"I thought it would be better for both that we should not meet,\"\nreplied I, as calmly as I could, but not daring to speak above my\nbreath, from conscious inability to steady my voice, and not daring to\nlook in her face lest my firmness should forsake me altogether. \"I\nthought an interview would only disturb your peace and madden me. But I\nam glad, now, of this opportunity of seeing you once more and knowing\nthat you have not forgotten me, and of assuring you that I shall never\ncease to remember you.\"\nThere was a moment's pause.

Pluck it, however, she did, and\nhaving gently dashed the glittering powder from its leaves, approached\nit to her lips and said:\n\"This rose is not so fragrant as a summer flower, but it has stood\nthrough hardships none of _them_ could bear: the cold rain of winter\nhas sufficed to nourish it, and its faint sun to warm it; the bleak\nwinds have not blanched it, or broken its stem, and the keen frost has\nnot blighted it. Look, Gilbert, it is still fresh and blooming as a\nflower can be, with the cold snow even now on its petals.\u2014Will you have\nit?\"\nI held out my hand: I dared not speak lest my emotion should overmaster\nme.

I was in an agony of mingled\nlove, hope, delight, uncertainty, and suspense.\n\"The rose I gave you was an emblem of my heart,\" said she; \"would you\ntake it away and leave me here alone?\"\n\"Would you give me your hand too, if I asked it?\"\n\"Have I not said enough?\" she answered, with a most enchanting smile. I\nsnatched her hand, and would have fervently kissed it, but suddenly\nchecked myself, and said,\u2014\n\"But have you considered the consequences?\"\n\"Hardly, I think, or I should not have offered myself to one too proud\nto take me, or too indifferent to make his affection outweigh my\nworldly goods.\"\nStupid blockhead that I was!\u2014I trembled to clasp her in my arms, but\ndared not believe in so much joy, and yet restrained myself to say,\u2014\n\"But if you _should_ repent!\"\n\"It would be your fault,\" she replied: \"I never shall, unless you\nbitterly disappoint me. If you have not sufficient confidence in my\naffection to believe this, let me alone.\"\n\"My darling angel\u2014my _own Helen_,\" cried I, now passionately kissing\nthe hand I still retained, and throwing my left arm around her, \"you\nnever shall repent, if it depend on me alone. But have you thought of\nyour aunt?\" I trembled for the answer, and clasped her closer to my\nheart in the instinctive dread of losing my new-found treasure.\n\"My aunt must not know of it yet,\" said she. \"She would think it a\nrash, wild step, because she could not imagine how well I know you; but\nshe must know you herself, and learn to like you. You must leave us\nnow, after lunch, and come again in spring, and make a longer stay, and\ncultivate her acquaintance, and I know you will like each other.\"\n\"And then you will be mine,\" said I, printing a kiss upon her lips, and\nanother, and another; for I was as daring and impetuous now as I had\nbeen backward and constrained before.\n\"No\u2014in another year,\" replied she, gently disengaging herself from my\nembrace, but still fondly clasping my hand.\n\"Another year! Oh, Helen, I could not wait so long!\"\n\"Where is your fidelity?\"\n\"I mean I could not endure the misery of so long a separation.\"\n\"It would not be a separation: we will write every day: my spirit shall\nbe always with you, and sometimes you shall see me with your bodily\neye. I will not be such a hypocrite as to pretend that I desire to wait\nso long myself, but as my marriage is to please myself, alone, I ought\nto consult my friends about the time of it.\"\n\"Your friends will disapprove.\"\n\"They will not greatly disapprove, dear Gilbert,\" said she, earnestly\nkissing my hand; \"they cannot, when they know you, or, if they could,\nthey would not be true friends\u2014I should not care for their\nestrangement. Now are you satisfied?\" She looked up in my face with a\nsmile of ineffable tenderness.\n\"Can I be otherwise, with your love? And you _do_ love me, Helen?\" said\nI, not doubting the fact, but wishing to hear it confirmed by her own\nacknowledgment.\n\"If you loved as _I_ do,\" she earnestly replied, \"you would not have so\nnearly lost me\u2014these scruples of false delicacy and pride would never\nthus have troubled you\u2014you would have seen that the greatest worldly\ndistinctions and discrepancies of rank, birth, and fortune are as dust\nin the balance compared with the unity of accordant thoughts and\nfeelings, and truly loving, sympathising hearts and souls.\"\n\"But this is too much happiness,\" said I, embracing her again; \"I have\nnot deserved it, Helen\u2014I dare not believe in such felicity: and the\nlonger I have to wait, the greater will be my dread that something will\nintervene to snatch you from me\u2014and think, a thousand things may happen\nin a year!\u2014I shall be in one long fever of restless terror and\nimpatience all the time. And besides, winter is such a dreary season.\"\n\"I thought so too,\" replied she gravely: \"I would not be married in\nwinter\u2014in December, at least,\" she added, with a shudder\u2014for in that\nmonth had occurred both the ill-starred marriage that had bound her to\nher former husband, and the terrible death that released her\u2014\"and\ntherefore I said another year, in spring.\"\n\"_Next_ spring?\"\n\"No, no\u2014next autumn, perhaps.\"\n\"Summer, then?\"\n\"Well, the close of summer. There now! be satisfied.\"\nWhile she was speaking Arthur re-entered the room\u2014good boy for keeping\nout so long.\n\"Mamma, I couldn't find the book in either of the places you told me to\nlook for it\" (there was a conscious something in mamma's smile that\nseemed to say, \"No, dear, I knew you could not\"), \"but Rachel got it\nfor me at last. Look, Mr. Markham, a natural history, with all kinds of\nbirds and beasts in it, and the reading as nice as the pictures!\"\nIn great good humour I sat down to examine the book, and drew the\nlittle fellow between my knees. Had he come a minute before I should\nhave received him less graciously, but now I affectionately stroked his\ncurling locks, and even kissed his ivory forehead: he was my own\nHelen's son, and therefore mine; and as such I have ever since regarded\nhim. That pretty child is now a fine young man: he has realised his\nmother's brightest expectations, and is at present residing in\nGrassdale Manor with his young wife\u2014the merry little Helen Hattersley\nof yore.\nI had not looked through half the book before Mrs. Maxwell appeared to\ninvite me into the other room to lunch. That lady's cool, distant\nmanners rather chilled me at first; but I did my best to propitiate\nher, and not entirely without success, I think, even in that first\nshort visit; for when I talked cheerfully to her, she gradually became\nmore kind and cordial, and when I departed she bade me a gracious\nadieu, hoping ere long to have the pleasure of seeing me again.\n\"But you must not go till you have seen the conservatory, my aunt's\nwinter garden,\" said Helen, as I advanced to take leave of her, with as\nmuch philosophy and self-command as I could summon to my aid.\nI gladly availed myself of such a respite, and followed her into a\nlarge and beautiful conservatory, plentifully furnished with flowers,\nconsidering the season\u2014but, of course, I had little attention to spare\nfor _them_. It was not, however, for any tender colloquy that my\ncompanion had brought me there:\u2014\n\"My aunt is particularly fond of flowers,\" she observed, \"and she is\nfond of Staningley too: I brought you here to offer a petition in her\nbehalf, that this may be her home as long as she lives, and\u2014if it be\nnot our home likewise\u2014that I may often see her and be with her; for I\nfear she will be sorry to lose me; and though she leads a retired and\ncontemplative life, she is apt to get low-spirited if left too much\nalone.\"\n\"By all means, dearest Helen!\u2014do what you will with your own. I should\nnot dream of wishing your aunt to leave the place under any\ncircumstances; and we will live either here or elsewhere as you and she\nmay determine, and you shall see her as often as you like. I know she\nmust be pained to part with you, and I am willing to make any\nreparation in my power. I love her for your sake, and her happiness\nshall be as dear to me as that of my own mother.\"\n\"Thank you, darling! you shall have a kiss for that. Good-by. There\nnow\u2014there, Gilbert\u2014let me go\u2014here's Arthur; don't astonish his\ninfantile brain with your madness.\"\n* * * * *\nBut it is time to bring my narrative to a close. Any one but you would\nsay I had made it too long already. But for _your_ satisfaction I will\nadd a few words more; because I know you will have a fellow-feeling for\nthe old lady, and will wish to know the last of her history. I did come\nagain in spring, and, agreeably to Helen's injunctions, did my best to\ncultivate her acquaintance. She received me very kindly, having been,\ndoubtless, already prepared to think highly of my character by her\nniece's too favourable report. I turned my best side out, of course,\nand we got along marvellously well together. When my ambitious\nintentions were made known to her, she took it more sensibly than I had\nventured to hope. Her only remark on the subject, in my hearing, was\u2014\n\"And so, Mr. Markham, you are going to rob me of my niece, I\nunderstand. Well! I hope God will prosper your union, and make my dear\ngirl happy at last. Could she have been contented to remain single, I\nown I should have been better satisfied; but if she must marry again, I\nknow of no one, now living and of a suitable age, to whom I would more\nwillingly resign her than yourself, or who would be more likely to\nappreciate her worth and make, her truly happy, as far as I can tell.\"\nOf course I was delighted with the compliment, and hoped to show her\nthat she was not mistaken in her favourable judgment.\n\"I have, however, one request to offer,\" continued she. \"It seems I am\nstill to look on Staningley as my home: I wish you to make it yours\nlikewise, for Helen is attached to the place and to me\u2014as I am to her.\nThere are painful associations connected with Grassdale, which she\ncannot easily overcome; and I shall not molest you with my company or\ninterference here: I am a very quiet person, and shall keep my own\napartments, and attend to my own concerns, and only see you now and\nthen.\"\nOf course I most readily consented to this; and we lived in the\ngreatest harmony with our dear aunt until the day of her death, which\nmelancholy event took place a few years after\u2014melancholy, not to\nherself (for it came quietly upon her, and she was glad to reach her\njourney's end), but only to the few loving friends and grateful\ndependents she left behind.\nTo return, however, to my own affairs: I was married in summer, on a\nglorious August morning. It took the whole eight months, and all\nHelen's kindness and goodness to boot, to overcome my mother's\nprejudices against my bride-elect, and to reconcile her to the idea of\nmy leaving Linden Grange and living so far away. Yet she was gratified\nat her son's good fortune after all, and proudly attributed it all to\nhis own superior merits and endowments. I bequeathed the farm to\nFergus, with better hopes of its prosperity than I should have had a\nyear ago under similar circumstances; for he had lately fallen in love\nwith the Vicar of L\u2014\u2014's eldest daughter\u2014a lady whose superiority had\nroused his latent virtues, and stimulated him to the most surprising\nexertions, not only to gain her affection and esteem, and to obtain a\nfortune sufficient to aspire to her hand, but to render himself worthy\nof her, in his own eyes, as well as in those of her parents; and in the\nend he was successful, as you already know. As for myself, I need not\ntell you how happily my Helen and I have lived together, and how\nblessed we still are in each other's society, and in the promising\nyoung scions that are growing up about us. We are just now looking\nforward to the advent of you and Rose, for the time of your annual\nvisit draws nigh, when you must leave your dusty, smoky, noisy,\ntoiling, striving city for a season of invigorating relaxation and\nsocial retirement with us.\nTill then, farewell,\nGILBERT MARKHAM.\n_Staningley_, _June_ 10_th_, 1847.\nTHE END",
