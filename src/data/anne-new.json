      "text": "MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down\ninto a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and\ntraversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the\nold Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook\nin its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool\nand cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde's Hollow it was a quiet,\nwell-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs.\nRachel Lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum; it\nprobably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window,\nkeeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children\nup, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never\nrest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.\nThere are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend\nclosely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own;\nbut Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage\ntheir own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a\nnotable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she \"ran\" the\nSewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop\nof the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all\nthis Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen\nwindow, knitting \"cotton warp\" quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them,\nas Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping\na sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up\nthe steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular\npeninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two\nsides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that\nhill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel's all-seeing\neye.\nShe was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in\nat the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house\nwas in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of\nbees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called \"Rachel\nLynde's husband\"--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field\nbeyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on\nthe big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew\nthat he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening\nbefore in William J. Blair's store over at Carmody that he meant to sow\nhis turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for\nMatthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about\nanything in his whole life.\nAnd yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon\nof a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill;\nmoreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was\nplain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy\nand the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable\ndistance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going\nthere?\nHad it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this\nand that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both\nquestions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be\nsomething pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest\nman alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where\nhe might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and\ndriving in a buggy, was something that didn't happen often.

      "text": "Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the\nbig, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a\nscant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde's Hollow. To be sure, the\nlong lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert's father, as\nshy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly\ncould from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods\nwhen he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest\nedge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible\nfrom the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so\nsociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place\n_living_ at all.\n\"It's just _staying_, that's what,\" she said as she stepped along the\ndeep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. \"It's no wonder\nMatthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by\nthemselves. Trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were\nthere'd be enough of them. I'd ruther look at people. To be sure, they\nseem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they're used to it. A body\ncan get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.\"\nWith this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green\nGables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one\nside with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies.\nNot a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have\nseen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla\nCuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could\nhave eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial\npeck of dirt.\nMrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in\nwhen bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful\napartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully\nclean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its\nwindows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on\nthe back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one,\nwhence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left\norchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook,\nwas greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when\nshe sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to\nher too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to\nbe taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind\nher was laid for supper.\nMrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental\nnote of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid,\nso that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but\nthe dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves\nand one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any\nparticular company. Yet what of Matthew's white collar and the sorrel\nmare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery\nabout quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.",

      "text": "\"Good evening, Rachel,\" Marilla said briskly. \"This is a real fine\nevening, isn't it? Won't you sit down? How are all your folks?\"\nSomething that for lack of any other name might be called friendship\nexisted and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel,\nin spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.\nMarilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark\nhair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little\nknot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She\nlooked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she\nwas; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had\nbeen ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative\nof a sense of humor.\n\"We're all pretty well,\" said Mrs. Rachel. \"I was kind of afraid _you_\nweren't, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe\nhe was going to the doctor's.\"\nMarilla's lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs.\nRachel up; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so\nunaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity.\n\"Oh, no, I'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday,\" she\nsaid. \"Matthew went to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an\norphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming on the train tonight.\"\nIf Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a\nkangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.\nShe was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable\nthat Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to\nsuppose it.\n\"Are you in earnest, Marilla?\" she demanded when voice returned to her.\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums\nin Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated\nAvonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.\nMrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought\nin exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people\nadopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly\nturning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this!\nNothing!\n\"What on earth put such a notion into your head?\" she demanded\ndisapprovingly.\nThis had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be\ndisapproved.\n\"Well, we've been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,\"\nreturned Marilla. \"Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before\nChristmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the\nasylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs.\nSpencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have\ntalked it over off and on ever since. We thought we'd get a boy. Matthew\nis getting up in years, you know--he's sixty--and he isn't so spry as he\nonce was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate\nhard it's got to be to get hired help. There's never anybody to be had\nbut those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do\nget one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the\nlobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a\nHome boy. But I said 'no' flat to that. 'They may be all right--I'm not\nsaying they're not--but no London street Arabs for me,' I said. 'Give\nme a native born at least. There'll be a risk, no matter who we get. But\nI'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born\nCanadian.' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out\none when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she\nwas going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer's folks at Carmody\nto bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that\nwould be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores\nright off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him\na good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer\ntoday--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming\non the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to\nmeet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to\nWhite Sands station herself.\"",

Matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen\nwhat she was really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would\nhave seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very\ntight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey. She wore a faded brown\nsailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids\nof very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin,\nalso much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which\nlooked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.\nSo far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen\nthat the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes\nwere full of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped\nand expressive; that the forehead was broad and full; in short,\nour discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no\ncommonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom\nshy Matthew Cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid.\nMatthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon\nas she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with\none thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag;\nthe other she held out to him.\n\"I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?\" she said in\na peculiarly clear, sweet voice. \"I'm very glad to see you. I was\nbeginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me and I was imagining\nall the things that might have happened to prevent you. I had made up\nmy mind that if you didn't come for me to-night I'd go down the track to\nthat big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all\nnight. I wouldn't be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a\nwild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don't you think?\nYou could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn't you? And\nI was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn't\nto-night.\"\nMatthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his; then and\nthere he decided what to do. He could not tell this child with the\nglowing eyes that there had been a mistake; he would take her home and\nlet Marilla do that. She couldn't be left at Bright River anyhow, no\nmatter what mistake had been made, so all questions and explanations\nmight as well be deferred until he was safely back at Green Gables.\n\"I'm sorry I was late,\" he said shyly. \"Come along. The horse is over in\nthe yard. Give me your bag.\"\n\"Oh, I can carry it,\" the child responded cheerfully. \"It isn't heavy.",

And if it isn't\ncarried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so I'd better\nkeep it because I know the exact knack of it. It's an extremely old\ncarpet-bag. Oh, I'm very glad you've come, even if it would have been\nnice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. We've got to drive a long piece,\nhaven't we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. I'm glad because I\nlove driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I'm going to live with you\nand belong to you. I've never belonged to anybody--not really. But the\nasylum was the worst. I've only been in it four months, but that was\nenough. I don't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you\ncan't possibly understand what it is like. It's worse than anything you\ncould imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like\nthat, but I didn't mean to be wicked. It's so easy to be wicked without\nknowing it, isn't it? They were good, you know--the asylum people. But\nthere is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just\nin the other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about\nthem--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really\nthe daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents\nin her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. I\nused to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because\nI didn't have time in the day. I guess that's why I'm so thin--I _am_\ndreadful thin, ain't I? There isn't a pick on my bones. I do love to\nimagine I'm nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows.\"\nWith this Matthew's companion stopped talking, partly because she was\nout of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy. Not another\nword did she say until they had left the village and were driving down\na steep little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into\nthe soft soil, that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees\nand slim white birches, were several feet above their heads.\nThe child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that\nbrushed against the side of the buggy.\n\"Isn't that beautiful? What did that tree, leaning out from the bank,\nall white and lacy, make you think of?\" she asked.\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Why, a bride, of course--a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil.\nI've never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like. I don't\never expect to be a bride myself. I'm so homely nobody will ever want to\nmarry me--unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign\nmissionary mightn't be very particular. But I do hope that some day I\nshall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I\njust love pretty clothes. And I've never had a pretty dress in my life\nthat I can remember--but of course it's all the more to look forward\nto, isn't it? And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously. This\nmorning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear\nthis horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you\nknow. A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of\nwincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn't sell\nit, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart,\nwouldn't you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be\nlooking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that\nI had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you _are_\nimagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big\nhat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and\nboots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island\nwith all my might. I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither\nwas Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn't time\nto get sick, watching to see that I didn't fall overboard. She said she\nnever saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from\nbeing seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it? And I wanted to see\neverything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn't know\nwhether I'd ever have another opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more\ncherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just\nlove it already, and I'm so glad I'm going to live here. I've always\nheard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world,\nand I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I\nwould. It's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it?\nBut those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at\nCharlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer\nwhat made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not\nto ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand\nalready. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about\nthings if you don't ask questions? And what _does_ make the roads red?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn't it splendid\nto think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes\nme feel glad to be alive--it's such an interesting world. It wouldn't be\nhalf so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There'd\nbe no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I talking too\nmuch? People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I didn't\ntalk? If you say so I'll stop. I can _stop_ when I make up my mind to it,",

      "text": "although it's difficult.\"\nMatthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet\nfolks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking\nthemselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had\nnever expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad\nenough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the\nway they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if\nthey expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to\nsay a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But\nthis freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather\ndifficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental\nprocesses he thought that he \"kind of liked her chatter.\" So he said as\nshyly as usual:\n\"Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don't mind.\"\n\"Oh, I'm so glad. I know you and I are going to get along together\nfine. It's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told\nthat children should be seen and not heard. I've had that said to me a\nmillion times if I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big\nwords. But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express\nthem, haven't you?\"\n\"Well now, that seems reasonable,\" said Matthew.\n\"Mrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. But it\nisn't--it's firmly fastened at one end. Mrs. Spencer said your place was\nnamed Green Gables. I asked her all about it. And she said there were\ntrees all around it. I was gladder than ever. I just love trees. And\nthere weren't any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny\nthings out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them.\nThey just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did. It used to\nmake me want to cry to look at them. I used to say to them, 'Oh, you\n_poor_ little things! If you were out in a great big woods with other\ntrees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your\nroots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you\ncould grow, couldn't you? But you can't where you are. I know just\nexactly how you feel, little trees.' I felt sorry to leave them behind\nthis morning. You do get so attached to things like that, don't you? Is\nthere a brook anywhere near Green Gables? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer\nthat.\"\n\"Well now, yes, there's one right below the house.\"\n\"Fancy. It's always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I\nnever expected I would, though. Dreams don't often come true, do they?\nWouldn't it be nice if they did? But just now I feel pretty nearly\nperfectly happy. I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because--well,\nwhat color would you call this?\"\nShe twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and\nheld it up before Matthew's eyes. Matthew was not used to deciding on\nthe tints of ladies' tresses, but in this case there couldn't be much\ndoubt.\n\"It's red, ain't it?\" he said.\nThe girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from\nher very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.\n\"Yes, it's red,\" she said resignedly. \"Now you see why I can't be\nperfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don't mind the other\nthings so much--the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness. I\ncan imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf\ncomplexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I _cannot_ imagine that\nred hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, 'Now my hair is a\nglorious black, black as the raven's wing.' But all the time I _know_ it\nis just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong sorrow.\nI read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn't\nred hair. Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow.\nWhat is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell me?\"\n\"Well now, I'm afraid I can't,\" said Matthew, who was getting a little\ndizzy. He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy\nhad enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic.\n\"Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was\ndivinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be\ndivinely beautiful?\"\n\"Well now, no, I haven't,\" confessed Matthew ingenuously.\n\"I have, often. Which would you rather be if you had the\nchoice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?\"\n\"Well now, I--I don't know exactly.\"\n\"Neither do I. I can never decide. But it doesn't make much real\ndifference for it isn't likely I'll ever be either. It's certain I'll\nnever be angelically good. Mrs. Spencer says--oh, Mr. Cuthbert! Oh, Mr.\nCuthbert!! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!!!\"\nThat was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled\nout of the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing. They had\nsimply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the \"Avenue.\"\nThe \"Avenue,\" so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of road\nfour or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge,\nwide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old\nfarmer. Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom. Below the\nboughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse\nof painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a\ncathedral aisle.\nIts beauty seemed to strike the child dumb. She leaned back in the\nbuggy, her thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to\nthe white splendor above. Even when they had passed out and were driving\ndown the long slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke. Still with\nrapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw\nvisions trooping splendidly across that glowing background. Through\nNewbridge, a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small\nboys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows, they drove, still\nin silence. When three more miles had dropped away behind them the child\nhad not spoken. She could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically\nas she could talk.",

Oh, _pretty_ doesn't seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful,\neither. They don't go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful--wonderful.\nIt's the first thing I ever saw that couldn't be improved upon by\nimagination.

But\nthey shouldn't call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning\nin a name like that. They should call it--let me see--the White Way of\nDelight. Isn't that a nice imaginative name? When I don't like the name\nof a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of\nthem so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins,\nbut I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that\nplace the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight.\nHave we really only another mile to go before we get home? I'm glad and\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I'm\nalways sorry when pleasant things end. Something still pleasanter may\ncome after, but you can never be sure. And it's so often the case that\nit isn't pleasanter. That has been my experience anyhow. But I'm glad to\nthink of getting home. You see, I've never had a real home since I can\nremember. It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming\nto a really truly home. Oh, isn't that pretty!\"\nThey had driven over the crest of a hill. Below them was a pond, looking\nalmost like a river so long and winding was it. A bridge spanned it\nmidway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of\nsand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a\nglory of many shifting hues--the most spiritual shadings of crocus and\nrose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name\nhas ever been found. Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing\ngroves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering\nshadows. Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a\nwhite-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection. From the marsh at the\nhead of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.\nThere was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on\na slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was\nshining from one of its windows.\n\"That's Barry's pond,\" said Matthew.\n\"Oh, I don't like that name, either. I shall call it--let me see--the\nLake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it. I know\nbecause of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives\nme a thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?\"\nMatthew ruminated.\n\"Well now, yes. It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly\nwhite grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. I hate the look of\nthem.\"\n\"Oh, I don't think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you\nthink it can? There doesn't seem to be much connection between grubs\nand lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it\nBarry's pond?\"\n\"I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house. Orchard\nSlope's the name of his place. If it wasn't for that big bush behind it\nyou could see Green Gables from here. But we have to go over the bridge\nand round by the road, so it's near half a mile further.\"",

I'd ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that.\nBut when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they\ngave him the naming of her and he called her Diana.\"\n\"I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born,\nthen. Oh, here we are at the bridge. I'm going to shut my eyes tight.\nI'm always afraid going over bridges. I can't help imagining that\nperhaps just as we get to the middle, they'll crumple up like a\njack-knife and nip us. So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them\nfor all when I think we're getting near the middle. Because, you see, if\nthe bridge _did_ crumple up I'd want to _see_ it crumple. What a jolly\nrumble it makes! I always like the rumble part of it. Isn't it splendid\nthere are so many things to like in this world? There we're over. Now\nI'll look back. Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters. I always say\ngood night to the things I love, just as I would to people. I think they\nlike it. That water looks as if it was smiling at me.\"\nWhen they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew\nsaid:\n\"We're pretty near home now. That's Green Gables over--\"\n\"Oh, don't tell me,\" she interrupted breathlessly, catching at his\npartially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his\ngesture. \"Let me guess. I'm sure I'll guess right.\"\nShe opened her eyes and looked about her. They were on the crest of a\nhill. The sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still\nclear in the mellow afterlight. To the west a dark church spire rose\nup against a marigold sky. Below was a little valley and beyond a long,\ngently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it. From one\nto another the child's eyes darted, eager and wistful. At last they\nlingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white\nwith blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods. Over it,\nin the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining\nlike a lamp of guidance and promise.\n\"That's it, isn't it?\" she said, pointing.\nMatthew slapped the reins on the sorrel's back delightedly.\n\"Well now, you've guessed it! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it\nso's you could tell.\"\n\"No, she didn't--really she didn't. All she said might just as well have\nbeen about most of those other places. I hadn't any real idea what it\nlooked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home. Oh, it\nseems as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and\nblue from the elbow up, for I've pinched myself so many times today.\nEvery little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and\nI'd be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I'd pinch myself to see if it\nwas real--until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only\na dream I'd better go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped\npinching. But it _is_ real and we're nearly home.\"\nWith a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred\nuneasily. He felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he who would\nhave to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was\nnot to be hers after all. They drove over Lynde's Hollow, where it was\nalready quite dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them\nfrom her window vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green\nGables. By the time they arrived at the house Matthew was shrinking from\nthe approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand. It was\nnot of Marilla or himself he was thinking or of the trouble this mistake\nwas probably going to make for them, but of the child's disappointment.\nWhen he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had\nan uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering\nsomething--much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill\na lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature.\nThe yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves\nwere rustling silkily all round it.\n\"Listen to the trees talking in their sleep,\" she whispered, as he\nlifted her to the ground. \"What nice dreams they must have!\"\nThen, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained \"all her worldly\ngoods,\" she followed him into the house.",

But, although it was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the\nthing to put a girl there somehow. But the spare room was out of the\nquestion for such a stray waif, so there remained only the east gable\nroom. Marilla lighted a candle and told Anne to follow her, which Anne\nspiritlessly did, taking her hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as\nshe passed. The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in\nwhich she presently found herself seemed still cleaner.\nMarilla set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and\nturned down the bedclothes.\n\"I suppose you have a nightgown?\" she questioned.\nAnne nodded.\n\"Yes, I have two. The matron of the asylum made them for me. They're\nfearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so\nthings are always skimpy--at least in a poor asylum like ours. I hate\nskimpy night-dresses. But one can dream just as well in them as\nin lovely trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that's one\nconsolation.\"\n\"Well, undress as quick as you can and go to bed. I'll come back in a\nfew minutes for the candle. I daren't trust you to put it out yourself.\nYou'd likely set the place on fire.\"\nWhen Marilla had gone Anne looked around her wistfully. The whitewashed\nwalls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache\nover their own bareness. The floor was bare, too, except for a round\nbraided mat in the middle such as Anne had never seen before. In\none corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark,\nlow-turned posts. In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner\ntable adorned with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the\npoint of the most adventurous pin. Above it hung a little six-by-eight\nmirror. Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white\nmuslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The whole\napartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which\nsent a shiver to the very marrow of Anne's bones. With a sob she hastily\ndiscarded her garments, put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed\nwhere she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes\nover her head. When Marilla came up for the light various skimpy\narticles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain\ntempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any",

It's kind of a pity\nto send her back when she's so set on staying here.\"\n\"Matthew Cuthbert, you don't mean to say you think we ought to keep\nher!\"\nMarilla's astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had\nexpressed a predilection for standing on his head.\n\"Well, now, no, I suppose not--not exactly,\" stammered Matthew,\nuncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. \"I\nsuppose--we could hardly be expected to keep her.\"\n\"I should say not. What good would she be to us?\"\n\"We might be some good to her,\" said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.\n\"Matthew Cuthbert, I believe that child has bewitched you! I can see as\nplain as plain that you want to keep her.\"\n\"Well now, she's a real interesting little thing,\" persisted Matthew.\n\"You should have heard her talk coming from the station.\"\n\"Oh, she can talk fast enough. I saw that at once. It's nothing in her\nfavour, either. I don't like children who have so much to say. I don't\nwant an orphan girl and if I did she isn't the style I'd pick out.\nThere's something I don't understand about her.

First came a\ndelightful thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible\nremembrance. This was Green Gables and they didn't want her because she\nwasn't a boy!\nBut it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside\nof her window. With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor.\nShe pushed up the sash--it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn't\nbeen opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight\nthat nothing was needed to hold it up.\nAnne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning, her eyes\nglistening with delight. Oh, wasn't it beautiful? Wasn't it a lovely\nplace? Suppose she wasn't really going to stay here! She would imagine\nshe was. There was scope for imagination here.\nA huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against\nthe house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf\nwas to be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of\napple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms;\nand their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below\nwere lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance\ndrifted up to the window on the morning wind.\nBelow the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the\nhollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew,\nupspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful\npossibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally. Beyond it\nwas a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in\nit where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the\nother side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible.\nOff to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over\ngreen, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.\nAnne's beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily\nin. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child;\nbut this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.\nShe knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until\nshe was startled by a hand on her shoulder.

Matthew also held his tongue,--but this\nwas natural,--so that the meal was a very silent one.\nAs it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating\nmechanically, with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the\nsky outside the window. This made Marilla more nervous than ever; she\nhad an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child's body might\nbe there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy\ncloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination.

      "text": "\"I was eleven last March,\" said Anne, resigning herself to bald facts\nwith a little sigh. \"And I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.\nMy father's name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the\nBolingbroke High School. My mother's name was Bertha Shirley. Aren't\nWalter and Bertha lovely names? I'm so glad my parents had nice names.\nIt would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\"I guess it doesn't matter what a person's name is as long as he behaves\nhimself,\" said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good\nand useful moral.\n\"Well, I don't know.\" Anne looked thoughtful. \"I read in a book once\nthat a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've never been\nable to believe it. I don't believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was\ncalled a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been\na good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but I'm sure it would\nhave been a cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school,\ntoo, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A\nhusband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were\na pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a\nweeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. I've never seen that\nhouse, but I've imagined it thousands of times. I think it must have\nhad honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and\nlilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in\nall the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born\nin that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I\nwas so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I\nwas perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge\nthan a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn't you? I'm glad she\nwas satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a\ndisappointment to her--because she didn't live very long after that, you\nsee. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she'd\nlived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it\nwould be so sweet to say 'mother,' don't you? And father died four days\nafterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at\ntheir wits' end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see,\nnobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother\nhad both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn't any\nrelatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she'd take me, though she was\npoor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up by hand. Do you know\nif there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make\npeople who are brought up that way better than other people? Because\nwhenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a\nbad girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I\nlived with them until I was eight years old. I helped look after the\nThomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and I can tell\nyou they took a lot of looking after. Then Mr. Thomas was killed\nfalling under a train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the\nchildren, but she didn't want me. Mrs. Thomas was at _her_ wits' end, so\nshe said, what to do with me. Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came\ndown and said she'd take me, seeing I was handy with children, and\nI went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the\nstumps. It was a very lonesome place. I'm sure I could never have\nlived there if I hadn't had an imagination. Mr. Hammond worked a little\nsawmill up there, and Mrs. Hammond had eight children. She had twins\nthree times. I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in\nsuccession is _too much_. I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly, when the last\npair came. I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about.\n\"I lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond\ndied and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She divided her children\namong her relatives and went to the States. I had to go to the asylum\nat Hopeton, because nobody would take me. They didn't want me at the\nasylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had\nto take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came.\"",

You'll put your horse in? And how\nare you, Anne?\"\n\"I'm as well as can be expected, thank you,\" said Anne smilelessly. A\nblight seemed to have descended on her.\n\"I suppose we'll stay a little while to rest the mare,\" said Marilla,\n\"but I promised Matthew I'd be home early. The fact is, Mrs. Spencer,\nthere's been a queer mistake somewhere, and I've come over to see where\nit is. We send word, Matthew and I, for you to bring us a boy from the\nasylum. We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or\neleven years old.\"\n\"Marilla Cuthbert, you don't say so!\" said Mrs. Spencer in distress.\n\"Why, Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you\nwanted a girl--didn't she Flora Jane?\" appealing to her daughter who had\ncome out to the steps.\n\"She certainly did, Miss Cuthbert,\" corroborated Flora Jane earnestly.\n\"I'm dreadful sorry,\" said Mrs. Spencer. \"It's too bad; but it certainly\nwasn't my fault, you see, Miss Cuthbert. I did the best I could and I\nthought I was following your instructions. Nancy is a terrible flighty\nthing. I've often had to scold her well for her heedlessness.\"\n\"It was our own fault,\" said Marilla resignedly. \"We should have come\nto you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by\nword of mouth in that fashion. Anyhow, the mistake has been made and the\nonly thing to do is to set it right. Can we send the child back to the\nasylum? I suppose they'll take her back, won't they?\"\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, \"but I don't think\nit will be necessary to send her back. Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here\nyesterday, and she was saying to me how much she wished she'd sent by me\nfor a little girl to help her. Mrs. Peter has a large family, you know,\nand she finds it hard to get help. Anne will be the very girl for you. I\ncall it positively providential.\"\nMarilla did not look as if she thought Providence had much to do with\nthe matter. Here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome\norphan off her hands, and she did not even feel grateful for it.\nShe knew Mrs. Peter Blewett only by sight as a small, shrewish-faced\nwoman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones. But she had\nheard of her. \"A terrible worker and driver,\" Mrs. Peter was said to\nbe; and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and\nstinginess, and her family of pert, quarrelsome children.

Take the armchair, Miss\nCuthbert. Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don't wiggle. Let\nme take your hats. Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on. Good\nafternoon, Mrs. Blewett.

She felt a lump coming up in her\nthroat and her eyes smarted painfully. She was beginning to be afraid\nshe couldn't keep the tears back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed\nand beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical,\nmental or spiritual, into consideration and settling it out of hand.\n\"It seems there's been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs. Blewett,\"\nshe said. \"I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted\na little girl to adopt. I was certainly told so. But it seems it was a\nboy they wanted. So if you're still of the same mind you were yesterday,\nI think she'll be just the thing for you.\"\nMrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.\n\"How old are you and what's your name?\" she demanded.\n\"Anne Shirley,\" faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make any\nstipulations regarding the spelling thereof, \"and I'm eleven years old.\"\n\"Humph! You don't look as if there was much to you. But you're wiry. I\ndon't know but the wiry ones are the best after all. Well, if I take you\nyou'll have to be a good girl, you know--good and smart and respectful.\nI'll expect you to earn your keep, and no mistake about that. Yes, I\nsuppose I might as well take her off your hands, Miss Cuthbert. The\nbaby's awful fractious, and I'm clean worn out attending to him. If you\nlike I can take her right home now.\"\nMarilla looked at Anne and softened at sight of the child's pale face\nwith its look of mute misery--the misery of a helpless little creature\nwho finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.\nMarilla felt an uncomfortable conviction that, if she denied the appeal\nof that look, it would haunt her to her dying day. More-over, she did\nnot fancy Mrs. Blewett. To hand a sensitive, \"highstrung\" child over to\nsuch a woman! No, she could not take the responsibility of doing that!\n\"Well, I don't know,\" she said slowly. \"I didn't say that Matthew and I\nhad absolutely decided that we wouldn't keep her. In fact I may say that\nMatthew is disposed to keep her. I just came over to find out how the\nmistake had occurred. I think I'd better take her home again and talk it\nover with Matthew. I feel that I oughtn't to decide on anything without\nconsulting him. If we make up our mind not to keep her we'll bring or\nsend her over to you tomorrow night. If we don't you may know that she\nis going to stay with us. Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?\"\n\"I suppose it'll have to,\" said Mrs. Blewett ungraciously.\nDuring Marilla's speech a sunrise had been dawning on Anne's face. First\nthe look of despair faded out; then came a faint flush of hope;\nher eyes grew deep and bright as morning stars.

And since you seem to want her, I\nsuppose I'm willing--or have to be. I've been thinking over the idea\nuntil I've got kind of used to it. It seems a sort of duty.

You're not quite a\nheathen. Where did you learn that?\"\n\"Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole\ncatechism. I liked it pretty well. There's something splendid about some\nof the words. 'Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.' Isn't that grand? It\nhas such a roll to it--just like a big organ playing. You couldn't quite\ncall it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn't it?\"\n\"We're not talking about poetry, Anne--we are talking about saying your\nprayers. Don't you know it's a terrible wicked thing not to say your\nprayers every night? I'm afraid you are a very bad little girl.\"\n\"You'd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,\" said\nAnne reproachfully. \"People who haven't red hair don't know what trouble\nis. Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red _on purpose_, and I've\nnever cared about Him since. And anyhow I'd always be too tired at night\nto bother saying prayers. People who have to look after twins can't be\nexpected to say their prayers. Now, do you honestly think they can?\"\nMarilla decided that Anne's religious training must be begun at once.\nPlainly there was no time to be lost.\n\"You must say your prayers while you are under my roof, Anne.\"\n\"Why, of course, if you want me to,\" assented Anne cheerfully. \"I'd do\nanything to oblige you.

It's a dreadful feeling.\nPlease tell me.\"\n\"You haven't scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to\ndo,\" said Marilla immovably. \"Just go and do it before you ask any more\nquestions, Anne.\"\nAnne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she returned to Marilla\nand fastened imploring eyes of the latter's face. \"Well,\" said Marilla,\nunable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer, \"I\nsuppose I might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep\nyou--that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself\ngrateful. Why, child, whatever is the matter?\"",

You couldn't really expect a person\nto pray very well the first time she tried, could you? I thought out a\nsplendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would.\nIt was nearly as long as a minister's and so poetical. But would you\nbelieve it?

The white and green light strained\nthrough apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt\nlittle figure with a half-unearthly radiance.\n\"Anne, whatever are you thinking of?\" demanded Marilla sharply.\nAnne came back to earth with a start.\n\"That,\" she said, pointing to the picture--a rather vivid chromo\nentitled, \"Christ Blessing Little Children\"--\"and I was just imagining I\nwas one of them--that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing\noff by herself in the corner as if she didn't belong to anybody, like\nme. She looks lonely and sad, don't you think? I guess she hadn't any\nfather or mother of her own. But she wanted to be blessed, too, so she\njust crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody would\nnotice her--except Him. I'm sure I know just how she felt. Her heart\nmust have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when I\nasked you if I could stay. She was afraid He mightn't notice her. But\nit's likely He did, don't you think? I've been trying to imagine it all\nout--her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite close\nto Him; and then He would look at her and put His hand on her hair and\noh, such a thrill of joy as would run over her! But I wish the artist\nhadn't painted Him so sorrowful looking. All His pictures are like that,\nif you've noticed. But I don't believe He could really have looked so\nsad or the children would have been afraid of Him.\"\n\"Anne,\" said Marilla, wondering why she had not broken into this speech\nlong before, \"you shouldn't talk that way. It's irreverent--positively\nirreverent.\"\nAnne's eyes marveled.\n\"Why, I felt just as reverent as could be. I'm sure I didn't mean to be\nirreverent.\"\n\"Well I don't suppose you did--but it doesn't sound right to talk so\nfamiliarly about such things. And another thing, Anne, when I send you\nafter something you're to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and\nimagining before pictures. Remember that. Take that card and come right\nto the kitchen. Now, sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by\nheart.\"",

I've dreamed of meeting her all\nmy life. I never really supposed I would, but so many of my loveliest\ndreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. Do\nyou think it's possible?\"\n\"Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she's about your age. She's\na very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when\nshe comes home. She's visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now. You'll\nhave to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is a\nvery particular woman. She won't let Diana play with any little girl who\nisn't nice and good.\"\nAnne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with\ninterest.\n\"What is Diana like? Her hair isn't red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It's bad\nenough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn't endure it in a\nbosom friend.\"\n\"Diana is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and\nrosy cheeks. And she is good and smart, which is better than being\npretty.\"\nMarilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was\nfirmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a\nchild who was being brought up.\nBut Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the\ndelightful possibilities before it.\n\"Oh, I'm so glad she's pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself--and\nthat's impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom\nfriend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting\nroom with glass doors. There weren't any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept\nher best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to\nkeep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night\nwhen he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to\npretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in\nit. I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to\ntalk to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything.\nKatie was the comfort and consolation of my life. We used to pretend\nthat the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I\ncould open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice\nlived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas' shelves of preserves and china. And\nthen Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a\nwonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have\nlived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond\nit just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully,\ntoo, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye\nthrough the bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond's. But\njust up the river a little way from the house there was a long green\nlittle valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every\nword you said, even if you didn't talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it\nwas a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved\nher almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you\nknow. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta,\nand oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had\nbecome so attached to her that I hadn't the heart to imagine a bosom\nfriend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination\nthere.\"\n\"I think it's just as well there wasn't,\" said Marilla drily. \"I\ndon't approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe your own\nimaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to\nput such nonsense out of your head. But don't let Mrs. Barry hear you\ntalking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she'll think you\ntell stories.\"",

Gossamers\nglimmered like threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and\ntassels seemed to utter friendly speech.\nAll these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half\nhours which she was allowed for play, and Anne talked Matthew and\nMarilla half-deaf over her discoveries. Not that Matthew complained, to\nbe sure; he listened to it all with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his\nface; Marilla permitted the \"chatter\" until she found herself becoming\ntoo interested in it, whereupon she always promptly quenched Anne by a\ncurt command to hold her tongue.",

She's a real bright little\nthing.\"\nMarilla said more than she had intended to say when she began, for she\nread disapproval in Mrs. Rachel's expression.\n\"It's a great responsibility you've taken on yourself,\" said that\nlady gloomily, \"especially when you've never had any experience with\nchildren. You don't know much about her or her real disposition, I\nsuppose, and there's no guessing how a child like that will turn out.\nBut I don't want to discourage you I'm sure, Marilla.\"\n\"I'm not feeling discouraged,\" was Marilla's dry response, \"when I make\nup my mind to do a thing it stays made up.

I'll call her in.\"\nAnne came running in presently, her face sparkling with the delight of\nher orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in\nthe unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside\nthe door. She certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short\ntight wincey dress she had worn from the asylum, below which her thin\nlegs seemed ungracefully long. Her freckles were more numerous and\nobtrusive than ever; the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into\nover-brilliant disorder; it had never looked redder than at that moment.\n\"Well, they didn't pick you for your looks, that's sure and certain,\"\nwas Mrs. Rachel Lynde's emphatic comment.

I was ashamed of you--thoroughly ashamed of you. I\nwanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have\ndisgraced me. I'm sure I don't know why you should lose your temper like\nthat just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You\nsay it yourself often enough.\"\n\"Oh, but there's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and\nhearing other people say it,\" wailed Anne. \"You may know a thing is\nso, but you can't help hoping other people don't quite think it is. I\nsuppose you think I have an awful temper, but I couldn't help it. When\nshe said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me.\nI _had_ to fly out at her.\"\n\"Well, you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say. Mrs. Lynde\nwill have a nice story to tell about you everywhere--and she'll tell\nit, too. It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that,\nAnne.\"\n\"Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that\nyou were skinny and ugly,\" pleaded Anne tearfully.\nAn old remembrance suddenly rose up before Marilla. She had been a very\nsmall child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, \"What a\npity she is such a dark, homely little thing.\" Marilla was every day of\nfifty before the sting had gone out of that memory.\n\"I don't say that I think Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying what\nshe did to you, Anne,\" she admitted in a softer tone. \"Rachel is too\noutspoken. But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part. She\nwas a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor--all three very good\nreasons why you should have been respectful to her. You were rude and\nsaucy and\"--Marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment--\"you must go\nto her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her\nto forgive you.\"\n\"I can never do that,\" said Anne determinedly and darkly. \"You can\npunish me in any way you like, Marilla. You can shut me up in a dark,\ndamp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and\nwater and I shall not complain. But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive\nme.\"\n\"We're not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons,\"\nsaid Marilla drily, \"especially as they're rather scarce in Avonlea. But\napologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and you'll stay here in your\nroom until you can tell me you're willing to do it.\"\n\"I shall have to stay here forever then,\" said Anne mournfully, \"because\nI can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her. How can\nI? I'm _not_ sorry. I'm sorry I've vexed you; but I'm _glad_ I told her just\nwhat I did. It was a great satisfaction. I can't say I'm sorry when I'm\nnot, can I? I can't even _imagine_ I'm sorry.\"\n\"Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the\nmorning,\" said Marilla, rising to depart. \"You'll have the night to\nthink over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind. You said\nyou would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables, but\nI must say it hasn't seemed very much like it this evening.\"\nLeaving this Parthian shaft to rankle in Anne's stormy bosom, Marilla\ndescended to the kitchen, grievously troubled in mind and vexed in\nsoul. She was as angry with herself as with Anne, because, whenever she\nrecalled Mrs. Rachel's dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with",

But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he\nhelped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.\nHe tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the\ndoor of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his\nfingers and then open the door to peep in.\nAnne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out\ninto the garden.

But then, I may as well get used to that.\"\nAnne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary\nimprisonment before her.\nMatthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without\nloss of time, lest Marilla return prematurely. \"Well now, Anne, don't\nyou think you'd better do it and have it over with?\" he whispered.\n\"It'll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla's a\ndreadful deter-mined woman--dreadful determined, Anne.

That's what I was trying to get at.\"\n\"I suppose I could do it to oblige you,\" said Anne thoughtfully. \"It\nwould be true enough to say I am sorry, because I _am_ sorry now. I wasn't\na bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all\nnight. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just\nfurious every time. But this morning it was over.

Take this chair, Marilla; it's easier\nthan the one you've got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit\non. Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of\ntaking about her after all. I don't feel so surprised at you and Matthew\nkeeping her as I did--nor so sorry for you, either.

She\ncompromised with her conscience by saying severely:\n\"I hope you won't have occasion to make many more such apologies. I hope\nyou'll try to control your temper now, Anne.\"\n\"That wouldn't be so hard if people wouldn't twit me about my looks,\"\nsaid Anne with a sigh. \"I don't get cross about other things; but I'm\n_so_ tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right\nover. Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I\ngrow up?\"\n\"You shouldn't think so much about your looks, Anne. I'm afraid you are\na very vain little girl.\"\n\"How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?\" protested Anne. \"I love\npretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that\nisn't pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful--just as I feel when I look\nat any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn't beautiful.\"\n\"Handsome is as handsome does,\" quoted Marilla. \"I've had that said\nto me before, but I have my doubts about it,\" remarked skeptical Anne,\nsniffing at her narcissi. \"Oh, aren't these flowers sweet! It was lovely\nof Mrs. Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings against Mrs.\nLynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and\nbe forgiven, doesn't it? Aren't the stars bright tonight? If you could\nlive in a star, which one would you pick? I'd like that lovely clear big\none away over there above that dark hill.\"\n\"Anne, do hold your tongue,\" said Marilla, thoroughly worn out trying to\nfollow the gyrations of Anne's thoughts.\nAnne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy\nwind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young\ndew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out\nthrough the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came\nclose to Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman's hard palm.\n\"It's lovely to be going home and know it's home,\" she said. \"I love\nGreen Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever\nseemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I'm so happy. I could pray right now and\nnot find it a bit hard.\"\nSomething warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla's heart at touch of\nthat thin little hand in her own--a throb of the maternity she had\nmissed, perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed\nher. She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by\ninculcating a moral.\n\"If you'll be a good girl you'll always be happy, Anne. And you should\nnever find it hard to say your prayers.\"\n\"Saying one's prayers isn't exactly the same thing as praying,\" said\nAnne meditatively. \"But I'm going to imagine that I'm the wind that is\nblowing up there in those tree tops. When I get tired of the trees I'll\nimagine I'm gently waving down here in the ferns--and then I'll fly over\nto Mrs. Lynde's garden and set the flowers dancing--and then I'll go\nwith one great swoop over the clover field--and then I'll blow over the\nLake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves.\nOh, there's so much scope for imagination in a wind! So I'll not talk\nany more just now, Marilla.\"\n\"Thanks be to goodness for that,\" breathed Marilla in devout relief.",

      "text": "WELL, how do you like them?\" said Marilla.\nAnne was standing in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new\ndresses spread out on the bed. One was of snuffy colored gingham which\nMarilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer\nbecause it looked so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered\nsateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and\none was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that\nweek at a Carmody store.\nShe had made them up herself, and they were all made alike--plain skirts\nfulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt\nand tight as sleeves could be.\n\"I'll imagine that I like them,\" said Anne soberly.\n\"I don't want you to imagine it,\" said Marilla, offended. \"Oh, I can see\nyou don't like the dresses! What is the matter with them? Aren't they\nneat and clean and new?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then why don't you like them?\"\n\"They're--they're not--pretty,\" said Anne reluctantly.\n\"Pretty!\" Marilla sniffed. \"I didn't trouble my head about getting\npretty dresses for you. I don't believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I'll\ntell you that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable\ndresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they're all\nyou'll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do\nyou for school when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and Sunday\nschool. I'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear\nthem. I should think you'd be grateful to get most anything after those\nskimpy wincey things you've been wearing.\"\n\"Oh, I _am_ grateful,\" protested Anne. \"But I'd be ever so much\ngratefuller if--if you'd made just one of them with puffed sleeves.\nPuffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill,\nMarilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.\"\n\"Well, you'll have to do without your thrill. I hadn't any material\nto waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things\nanyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones.\"\n\"But I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and\nsensible all by myself,\" persisted Anne mournfully.\n\"Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your\ncloset, and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson. I got\na quarterly from Mr. Bell for you and you'll go to Sunday school\ntomorrow,\" said Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon.",

      "text": "Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school\nclass for twenty years. Her method of teaching was to ask the printed\nquestions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the\nparticular little girl she thought ought to answer the question. She\nlooked very often at Anne, and Anne, thanks to Marilla's drilling,\nanswered promptly; but it may be questioned if she understood very much\nabout either question or answer.\nShe did not think she liked Miss Rogerson, and she felt very miserable;\nevery other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that\nlife was really not worth living without puffed sleeves.\n\"Well, how did you like Sunday school?\" Marilla wanted to know when Anne\ncame home. Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane,\nso Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.\n\"I didn't like it a bit. It was horrid.\"\n\"Anne Shirley!\" said Marilla rebukingly.\nAnne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny's\nleaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.\n\"They might have been lonesome while I was away,\" she explained. \"And\nnow about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs.\nLynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with\na lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the\nwindow while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully\nlong prayer. I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through\nif I hadn't been sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the\nLake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts\nof splendid things.\"\n\"You shouldn't have done anything of the sort. You should have listened\nto Mr. Bell.\"\n\"But he wasn't talking to me,\" protested Anne. \"He was talking to God\nand he didn't seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. I think\nhe thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of white\nbirches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through\nthem, 'way, 'way down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a\nbeautiful dream! It gave me a thrill and I just said, 'Thank you for it,\nGod,' two or three times.\"\n\"Not out loud, I hope,\" said Marilla anxiously.\n\"Oh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last\nand they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson's class.\nThere were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried\nto imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn't. Why couldn't I? It was\nas easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in\nthe east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had\nreally truly puffs.\"\n\"You shouldn't have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school.\nYou should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it.\"\n\"Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so\nmany. I don't think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were\nlots I wanted to ask her, but I didn't like to because I didn't think\nshe was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a\nparaphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn't, but I could\nrecite, 'The Dog at His Master's Grave' if she liked. That's in the\nThird Royal Reader. It isn't a really truly religious piece of poetry,\nbut it's so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it\nwouldn't do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next\nSunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it's splendid. There are\ntwo lines in particular that just thrill me.\n\"'Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell\nIn Midian's evil day.'\n\"I don't know what 'squadrons' means nor 'Midian,' either, but it sounds\n_so_ tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it.\nI'll practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss\nRogerson--because Mrs. Lynde was too far away--to show me your pew.\nI sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third\nchapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text. If I was a\nminister I'd pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long,\ntoo. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didn't think\nhe was a bit interesting. The trouble with him seems to be that he\nhasn't enough imagination. I didn't listen to him very much. I just let\nmy thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things.\"\nMarilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but\nshe was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things Anne had\nsaid, especially about the minister's sermons and Mr. Bell's prayers,\nwere what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for\nyears, but had never given expression to. It almost seemed to her that\nthose secret, unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible\nand accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of\nneglected humanity.",

I assure you I'll say my prayers with a right\ngood-will tonight. Diana and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr.\nWilliam Bell's birch grove tomorrow. Can I have those broken pieces of\nchina that are out in the woodshed? Diana's birthday is in February and\nmine is in March. Don't you think that is a very strange coincidence?\nDiana is going to lend me a book to read. She says it's perfectly\nsplendid and tremendously exciting. She's going to show me a place back\nin the woods where rice lilies grow. Don't you think Diana has got very\nsoulful eyes? I wish I had soulful eyes. Diana is going to teach me to\nsing a song called 'Nelly in the Hazel Dell.' She's going to give me a\npicture to put up in my room; it's a perfectly beautiful picture, she\nsays--a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress. A sewing-machine agent\ngave it to her. I wish I had something to give Diana. I'm an inch taller\nthan Diana, but she is ever so much fatter; she says she'd like to be\nthin because it's so much more graceful, but I'm afraid she only said\nit to soothe my feelings. We're going to the shore some day to gather\nshells. We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the\nDryad's Bubble. Isn't that a perfectly elegant name? I read a story\nonce about a spring called that. A dryad is sort of a grown-up fairy, I\nthink.\"\n\"Well, all I hope is you won't talk Diana to death,\" said Marilla. \"But\nremember this in all your planning, Anne. You're not going to play all\nthe time nor most of it. You'll have your work to do and it'll have to\nbe done first.\"\nAnne's cup of happiness was full, and Matthew caused it to overflow.

There,\nthere, child, don't look so dismal. You can eat those, since Matthew\nhas gone and got them. He'd better have brought you peppermints. They're\nwholesomer. Don't sicken yourself eating all them at once now.\"\n\"Oh, no, indeed, I won't,\" said Anne eagerly. \"I'll just eat one\ntonight, Marilla. And I can give Diana half of them, can't I? The\nother half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her. It's\ndelightful to think I have something to give her.\"\n\"I will say it for the child,\" said Marilla when Anne had gone to\nher gable, \"she isn't stingy. I'm glad, for of all faults I detest\nstinginess in a child. Dear me, it's only three weeks since she came,\nand it seems as if she'd been here always. I can't imagine the place\nwithout her. Now, don't be looking I told-you-so, Matthew. That's bad\nenough in a woman, but it isn't to be endured in a man.

      "text": "Getting through with her \"ohs\" Anne cast herself into Marilla's arms and\nrapturously kissed her sallow cheek. It was the first time in her whole\nlife that childish lips had voluntarily touched Marilla's face. Again\nthat sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her. She was\nsecretly vastly pleased at Anne's impulsive caress, which was probably\nthe reason why she said brusquely:\n\"There, there, never mind your kissing nonsense. I'd sooner see you\ndoing strictly as you're told. As for cooking, I mean to begin giving\nyou lessons in that some of these days. But you're so featherbrained,\nAnne, I've been waiting to see if you'd sober down a little and learn\nto be steady before I begin. You've got to keep your wits about you in\ncooking and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove\nall over creation. Now, get out your patchwork and have your square done\nbefore teatime.\"\n\"I do _not_ like patchwork,\" said Anne dolefully, hunting out her\nworkbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white\ndiamonds with a sigh. \"I think some kinds of sewing would be nice; but\nthere's no scope for imagination in patchwork. It's just one little seam\nafter another and you never seem to be getting anywhere. But of course\nI'd rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any\nother place with nothing to do but play. I wish time went as quick\nsewing patches as it does when I'm playing with Diana, though. Oh, we\ndo have such elegant times, Marilla. I have to furnish most of the\nimagination, but I'm well able to do that. Diana is simply perfect in\nevery other way. You know that little piece of land across the brook\nthat runs up between our farm and Mr. Barry's. It belongs to Mr. William\nBell, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch\ntrees--the most romantic spot, Marilla. Diana and I have our playhouse\nthere. We call it Idlewild. Isn't that a poetical name? I assure you it\ntook me some time to think it out. I stayed awake nearly a whole night\nbefore I invented it. Then, just as I was dropping off to sleep, it came\nlike an inspiration. Diana was _enraptured_ when she heard it. We have got\nour house fixed up elegantly. You must come and see it, Marilla--won't\nyou? We have great big stones, all covered with moss, for seats, and\nboards from tree to tree for shelves. And we have all our dishes on\nthem. Of course, they're all broken but it's the easiest thing in the\nworld to imagine that they are whole. There's a piece of a plate with a\nspray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful. We keep\nit in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too. The fairy glass\nis as lovely as a dream. Diana found it out in the woods behind their\nchicken house. It's all full of rainbows--just little young rainbows\nthat haven't grown big yet--and Diana's mother told her it was broken\noff a hanging lamp they once had. But it's nice to imagine the fairies\nlost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it the fairy glass.\nMatthew is going to make us a table. Oh, we have named that little round\npool over in Mr. Barry's field Willowmere. I got that name out of the\nbook Diana lent me. That was a thrilling book, Marilla. The heroine\nhad five lovers. I'd be satisfied with one, wouldn't you? She was very\nhandsome and she went through great tribulations. She could faint as\neasy as anything. I'd love to be able to faint, wouldn't you, Marilla?\nIt's so romantic. But I'm really very healthy for all I'm so thin. I\nbelieve I'm getting fatter, though. Don't you think I am? I look at my\nelbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming.\nDiana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She is going to\nwear it to the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday. I\ndon't feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened\nto prevent me from getting to the picnic. I suppose I'd live through it,\nbut I'm certain it would be a lifelong sorrow. It wouldn't matter if\nI got to a hundred picnics in after years; they wouldn't make up for\nmissing this one. They're going to have boats on the Lake of Shining",

So we want to have one, too. And it's a very pretty\nname, don't you think? So romantic! We can't imagine the lovers into it,\nyou know.

Just look at him and see if you don't\nthink he's handsome.\"\nAnne looked accordingly. She had a good chance to do so, for the said\nGilbert Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid\nof Ruby Gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. He\nwas a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth\ntwisted into a teasing smile. Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take\na sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek,\nbelieving that her hair was pulled out by the roots. Everybody looked at\nher and Mr. Phillips glared so sternly that Ruby began to cry. Gilbert\nhad whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the\nsoberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at\nAnne and winked with inexpressible drollery.\n\"I think your Gilbert Blythe _is_ handsome,\" confided Anne to Diana,\n\"but I think he's very bold. It isn't good manners to wink at a strange\ngirl.\"\nBut it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.\nMr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to\nPrissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as\nthey pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their\nslates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.\nGilbert Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him and failing\nutterly, because Anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only\nto the very existence of Gilbert Blythe, but of every other scholar in\nAvonlea school itself. With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes\nfixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west\nwindow afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and\nseeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.\nGilbert Blythe wasn't used to putting himself out to make a girl look\nat him and meeting with failure. She _should_ look at him, that red-haired\nShirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren't\nlike the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.\nGilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne's long red\nbraid, held it out at arm's length and said in a piercing whisper:\n\"Carrots! Carrots!\"\nThen Anne looked at him with a vengeance!\nShe did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies\nfallen into cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert\nfrom eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry\ntears.\n\"You mean, hateful boy!\" she exclaimed passionately. \"How dare you!\"\nAnd then--thwack! Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert's head and\ncracked it--slate not head--clear across.\nAvonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable\none. Everybody said \"Oh\" in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby\nGillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Tommy\nSloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared\nopen-mouthed at the tableau.\nMr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Anne's\nshoulder.\n\"Anne Shirley, what does this mean?\" he said angrily. Anne returned no\nanswer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell\nbefore the whole school that she had been called \"carrots.\" Gilbert it\nwas who spoke up stoutly.\n\"It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her.\"\nMr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.\n\"I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such\na vindictive spirit,\" he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of\nbeing a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts\nof small imperfect mortals. \"Anne, go and stand on the platform in front\nof the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.\"\nAnne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under\nwhich her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white,\nset face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the\nblackboard above her head.\n\"Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control\nher temper,\" and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,\nwho couldn't read writing, should understand it.\nAnne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.\nShe did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart\nfor that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With\nresentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana's\nsympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane's indignant nods and Josie Pye's\nmalicious smiles. As for Gilbert Blythe, she would not even look at him.\nShe would _never_ look at him again! She would never speak to him!!",

I never saw a child so worked up. I've been\nexpecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were\ngoing too smooth to last. She's so high strung. What would you advise,\nRachel?\"\n\"Well, since you've asked my advice, Marilla,\" said Mrs. Lynde\namiably--Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--\"I'd just\nhumor her a little at first, that's what I'd do. It's my belief that\nMr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn't do to say so to the\nchildren, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday\nfor giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who\nwere late should have been punished as well as Anne, that's what. And I\ndon't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It\nisn't modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne's part\nright through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular\namong them, somehow. I never thought she'd take with them so well.\"\n\"Then you really think I'd better let her stay home,\" said Marilla in\namazement.\n\"Yes. That is I wouldn't say school to her again until she said it\nherself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she'll cool off in a week or so and\nbe ready enough to go back of her own accord, that's what, while, if\nyou were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum\nshe'd take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the\nbetter, in my opinion. She won't miss much by not going to school, as\nfar as _that_ goes. Mr. Phillips isn't any good at all as a teacher. The\norder he keeps is scandalous, that's what, and he neglects the young\nfry and puts all his time on those big scholars he's getting ready for\nQueen's. He'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle\nhadn't been a trustee--_the_ trustee, for he just leads the other two\naround by the nose, that's what. I declare, I don't know what education\nin this Island is coming to.\"",

Into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face\ndownward on the sofa in an agony.\n\"Whatever has gone wrong now, Anne?\" queried Marilla in doubt and\ndismay. \"I do hope you haven't gone and been saucy to Mrs. Lynde again.\"\nNo answer from Anne save more tears and stormier sobs!\n\"Anne Shirley, when I ask you a question I want to be answered. Sit\nright up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.\"\nAnne sat up, tragedy personified.\n\"Mrs. Lynde was up to see Mrs. Barry today and Mrs. Barry was in an\nawful state,\" she wailed. \"She says that I set Diana _drunk_ Saturday\nand sent her home in a disgraceful condition. And she says I must be a\nthoroughly bad, wicked little girl and she's never, never going to let\nDiana play with me again. Oh, Marilla, I'm just overcome with woe.\"\nMarilla stared in blank amazement.\n\"Set Diana drunk!\" she said when she found her voice. \"Anne are you or\nMrs. Barry crazy? What on earth did you give her?\"\n\"Not a thing but raspberry cordial,\" sobbed Anne. \"I never thought\nraspberry cordial would set people drunk, Marilla--not even if they\ndrank three big tumblerfuls as Diana did. Oh, it sounds so--so--like\nMrs. Thomas's husband! But I didn't mean to set her drunk.\"\n\"Drunk fiddlesticks!\" said Marilla, marching to the sitting room pantry.\nThere on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one\ncontaining some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which\nshe was celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort,\nMrs. Barry among them, disapproved strongly of it. And at the same time\nMarilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial\ndown in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told Anne.\nShe went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand. Her face\nwas twitching in spite of herself.\n\"Anne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble. You went\nand gave Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial. Didn't you\nknow the difference yourself?\"\n\"I never tasted it,\" said Anne. \"I thought it was the cordial. I meant\nto be so--so--hospitable. Diana got awfully sick and had to go home.\nMrs. Barry told Mrs. Lynde she was simply dead drunk. She just laughed\nsilly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to\nsleep and slept for hours. Her mother smelled her breath and knew she\nwas drunk. She had a fearful headache all day yesterday. Mrs. Barry is\nso indignant. She will never believe but what I did it on purpose.\"\n\"I should think she would better punish Diana for being so greedy as to\ndrink three glassfuls of anything,\" said Marilla shortly. \"Why, three\nof those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been\ncordial. Well, this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are\nso down on me for making currant wine, although I haven't made any for\nthree years ever since I found out that the minister didn't approve. I\njust kept that bottle for sickness. There, there, child, don't cry. I\ncan't see as you were to blame although I'm sorry it happened so.\"\n\"I must cry,\" said Anne. \"My heart is broken. The stars in their courses\nfight against me, Marilla. Diana and I are parted forever. Oh, Marilla,\nI little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship.\"\n\"Don't be foolish, Anne.

To do her justice, she really believed Anne had\nmade Diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense, and she was honestly\nanxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of\nfurther intimacy with such a child.\n\"What do you want?\" she said stiffly.\nAnne clasped her hands.\n\"Oh, Mrs. Barry, please forgive me.

Oh, please don't say that you won't let Diana play with me any\nmore.

She flung herself into her studies heart\nand soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by Gilbert Blythe.\nThe rivalry between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured\non Gilbert's side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing\ncannot be said of Anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for\nholding grudges. She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves. She\nwould not stoop to admit that she meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork,\nbecause that would have been to acknowledge his existence which Anne\npersistently ignored; but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated\nbetween them. Now Gilbert was head of the spelling class; now Anne, with\na toss of her long red braids, spelled him down. One morning Gilbert had\nall his sums done correctly and had his name written on the blackboard\non the roll of honor; the next morning Anne, having wrestled wildly with\ndecimals the entire evening before, would be first. One awful day they\nwere ties and their names were written up together. It was almost as bad\nas a take-notice and Anne's mortification was as evident as Gilbert's\nsatisfaction. When the written examinations at the end of each month\nwere held the suspense was terrible. The first month Gilbert came out\nthree marks ahead. The second Anne beat him by five. But her triumph was\nmarred by the fact that Gilbert congratulated her heartily before the\nwhole school. It would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had\nfelt the sting of his defeat.\nMr. Phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly\ndetermined on learning as Anne was could hardly escape making progress\nunder any kind of teacher. By the end of the term Anne and Gilbert were\nboth promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the\nelements of \"the branches\"--by which Latin, geometry, French, and\nalgebra were meant. In geometry Anne met her Waterloo.\n\"It's perfectly awful stuff, Marilla,\" she groaned. \"I'm sure I'll never\nbe able to make head or tail of it. There is no scope for imagination in\nit at all. Mr. Phillips says I'm the worst dunce he ever saw at it.\nAnd Gil--I mean some of the others are so smart at it. It is extremely\nmortifying, Marilla.\n\"Even Diana gets along better than I do. But I don't mind being beaten\nby Diana. Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with\nan _inextinguishable_ love. It makes me very sad at times to think about\nher. But really, Marilla, one can't stay sad very long in such an\ninteresting world, can one?\"",

      "text": "Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely\nat the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green\nGables all to themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned\nWaterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the\nwindowpanes. Matthew nodded over a _Farmers' Advocate_ on the sofa and\nAnne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite\nsundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that\nJane Andrews had lent her that day. Jane had assured her that it was\nwarranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and\nAnne's fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that would mean Gilbert\nBlythe's triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her back on the clock shelf\nand tried to imagine it wasn't there.\n\"Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?\"\n\"Well now, no, I didn't,\" said Matthew, coming out of his doze with a\nstart.\n\"I wish you had,\" sighed Anne, \"because then you'd be able to sympathize\nwith me. You can't sympathize properly if you've never studied it. It is\ncasting a cloud over my whole life. I'm such a dunce at it, Matthew.\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew soothingly. \"I guess you're all right\nat anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair's store at Carmody\nthat you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid\nprogress. 'Rapid progress' was his very words. There's them as runs down\nTeddy Phillips and says he ain't much of a teacher, but I guess he's all\nright.\"\nMatthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was \"all right.\"\n\"I'm sure I'd get on better with geometry if only he wouldn't change\nthe letters,\" complained Anne. \"I learn the proposition off by heart and\nthen he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what\nare in the book and I get all mixed up. I don't think a teacher should\ntake such a mean advantage, do you? We're studying agriculture now and\nI've found out at last what makes the roads red. It's a great comfort.\nI wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde\nsays Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa\nand that it's an awful warning to the electors. She says if women were\nallowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change. What way do you\nvote, Matthew?\"\n\"Conservative,\" said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was part of\nMatthew's religion.\n\"Then I'm Conservative too,\" said Anne decidedly. \"I'm glad because\nGil--because some of the boys in school are Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips\nis a Grit too because Prissy Andrews's father is one, and Ruby Gillis\nsays that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl's\nmother in religion and her father in politics. Is that true, Matthew?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Did you ever go courting, Matthew?\"\n\"Well now, no, I dunno's I ever did,\" said Matthew, who had certainly\nnever thought of such a thing in his whole existence.\nAnne reflected with her chin in her hands.\n\"It must be rather interesting, don't you think, Matthew? Ruby Gillis\nsays when she grows up she's going to have ever so many beaus on the\nstring and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too\nexciting. I'd rather have just one in his right mind. But Ruby Gillis\nknows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big\nsisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot\ncakes. Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening.\nHe says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is\nstudying for Queen's too, and I should think she needed help a lot more\nthan Prissy because she's ever so much stupider, but he never goes to\nhelp her in the evenings at all. There are a great many things in this\nworld that I can't understand very well, Matthew.\"\n\"Well now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,\" acknowledged\nMatthew.\n\"Well, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I won't allow myself to\nopen that new book Jane lent me until I'm through. But it's a terrible\ntemptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there\njust as plain. Jane said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book\nthat makes me cry. But I think I'll carry that book into the sitting\nroom and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must\n_not_ give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if\nI implore you on my bended knees. It's all very well to say resist\ntemptation, but it's ever so much easier to resist it if you can't get\nthe key. And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets,\nMatthew? Wouldn't you like some russets?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno but what I would,\" said Matthew, who never ate\nrussets but knew Anne's weakness for them.",

Anne, although sincerely sorry\nfor Minnie May, was far from being insensible to the romance of the\nsituation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a\nkindred spirit.\nThe night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy\nslope; big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the\ndark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the\nwind whistling through them. Anne thought it was truly delightful to go\nskimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend\nwho had been so long estranged.\nMinnie May, aged three, was really very sick. She lay on the kitchen\nsofa feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard\nall over the house. Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl\nfrom the creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children\nduring her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of\nthinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.\nAnne went to work with skill and promptness.\n\"Minnie May has croup all right; she's pretty bad, but I've seen them\nworse. First we must have lots of hot water. I declare, Diana, there\nisn't more than a cupful in the kettle! There, I've filled it up, and,\nMary Joe, you may put some wood in the stove. I don't want to hurt your\nfeelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if\nyou'd any imagination. Now, I'll undress Minnie May and put her to bed\nand you try to find some soft flannel cloths, Diana. I'm going to give\nher a dose of ipecac first of all.\"\nMinnie May did not take kindly to the ipecac but Anne had not brought up\nthree pairs of twins for nothing. Down that ipecac went, not only once,\nbut many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls\nworked patiently over the suffering Minnie May, and Young Mary Joe,\nhonestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated\nmore water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.\nIt was three o'clock when Matthew came with a doctor, for he had been\nobliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one. But the pressing need\nfor assistance was past. Minnie May was much better and was sleeping",

But the making of\nit was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come\nover as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses\nto me all the way down to Lover's Lane.

And the choir are going to\nsing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns.\nAnd oh, Marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is;\nhe's going to give an address.

She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see\nDiana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up\nwith a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.\n\"Who are you?\" demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.\n\"I'm Anne of Green Gables,\" said the small visitor tremulously, clasping\nher hands with her characteristic gesture, \"and I've come to confess, if\nyou please.\"\n\"Confess what?\"\n\"That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I\nsuggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure.\nDiana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it\nis to blame her.\"\n\"Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at\nleast. Such carryings on in a respectable house!\"\n\"But we were only in fun,\" persisted Anne. \"I think you ought to forgive\nus, Miss Barry, now that we've apologized. And anyhow, please forgive\nDiana and let her have her music lessons. Diana's heart is set on her\nmusic lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your\nheart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be\ncross with me. I've been so used in my early days to having people cross\nat me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.\"\nMuch of the snap had gone out of the old lady's eyes by this time\nand was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she still said\nseverely:\n\"I don't think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.\nLittle girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young. You\ndon't know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long\nand arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.\"\n\"I don't _know_, but I can _imagine_,\" said Anne eagerly. \"I'm sure it must\nhave been very disturbing. But then, there is our side of it too. Have\nyou any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have, just put yourself in\nour place. We didn't know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly\nscared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we\ncouldn't sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are\nused to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel\nlike if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.\"\nAll the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed--a\nsound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen\noutside, to give a great gasp of relief.\n\"I'm afraid my imagination is a little rusty--it's so long since I used\nit,\" she said. \"I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as\nmine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell me\nabout yourself.\"\n\"I am very sorry I can't,\" said Anne firmly. \"I would like to, because\nyou seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred\nspirit although you don't look very much like it. But it is my duty to\ngo home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind\nlady who has taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but\nit is very discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on\nthe bed. But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive\nDiana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.\"\n\"I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me\noccasionally,\" said Miss Barry.\nThat evening Miss Barry gave Diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the\nsenior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.\n\"I've made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better\nacquainted with that Anne-girl,\" she said frankly. \"She amuses me, and\nat my time of life an amusing person is a rarity.\"",

The maples in Lover's Lane were red budded\nand little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad's Bubble. Away up in\nthe barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane's place, the Mayflowers blossomed\nout, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the\nschool girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming\nhome in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of\nflowery spoil.\n\"I'm so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no\nMayflowers,\" said Anne. \"Diana says perhaps they have something better,\nbut there couldn't be anything better than Mayflowers, could there,\nMarilla? And Diana says if they don't know what they are like they don't\nmiss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it\nwould be _tragic_, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and _not_\nto miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think\nthey must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this\nis their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our\nlunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.\nCharlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because\nhe wouldn't take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very _fashionable_\nto dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews\nand I heard him to say 'sweets to the sweet.' He got that out of a\nbook, I know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered some\nMayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can't tell you the\nperson's name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We\nmade wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the\ntime came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two,\nwith our bouquets and wreaths, singing 'My Home on the Hill.' Oh, it was\nso thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane's folks rushed out to see us\nand everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a\nreal sensation.\"",

The\nwalls were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly\nand yellowly upright as ever. Yet the whole character of the room was\naltered. It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to\npervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses\nand ribbons, and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms\non the table. It was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its\nvivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had\ntapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and\nmoonshine. Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of Anne's freshly\nironed school aprons. She hung them over a chair and sat down with\na short sigh. She had had one of her headaches that afternoon, and\nalthough the pain had gone she felt weak and \"tuckered out,\" as she\nexpressed it. Anne looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy.\n\"I do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place, Marilla. I\nwould have endured it joyfully for your sake.\"\n\"I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me\nrest,\" said Marilla. \"You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer\nmistakes than usual. Of course it wasn't exactly necessary to starch\nMatthew's handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in the oven\nto warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of\nleaving it to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn't seem to be your way\nevidently.\"\nHeadaches always left Marilla somewhat sarcastic.\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" said Anne penitently. \"I never thought about that\npie from the moment I put it in the oven till now, although I felt\n_instinctively_ that there was something missing on the dinner table.

And goodness knows you've gone over\noften enough after dark.\"\n\"I'll go over early in the morning,\" said Anne eagerly. \"I'll get up at\nsunrise and go over, Marilla.\"\n\"What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley? I want that pattern to\ncut out your new apron this evening. Go at once and be smart too.\"\n\"I'll have to go around by the road, then,\" said Anne, taking up her hat\nreluctantly.\n\"Go by the road and waste half an hour! I'd like to catch you!\"\n\"I can't go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla,\" cried Anne desperately.\nMarilla stared.\n\"The Haunted Wood! Are you crazy? What under the canopy is the Haunted\nWood?\"\n\"The spruce wood over the brook,\" said Anne in a whisper.\n\"Fiddlesticks! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who\nhas been telling you such stuff?\"\n\"Nobody,\" confessed Anne. \"Diana and I just imagined the wood was\nhaunted. All the places around here are so--so--_commonplace_. We just got\nthis up for our own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is\nso very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it's so\ngloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There's a white\nlady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings\nher hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when there is to be a\ndeath in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the\ncorner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers\non your hand--so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And\nthere's a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower\nat you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldn't go through the\nHaunted Wood after dark now for anything. I'd be sure that white things\nwould reach out from behind the trees and grab me.\"\n\"Did ever anyone hear the like!\" ejaculated Marilla, who had\nlistened in dumb amazement. \"Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you\nbelieve all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?\"\n\"Not believe _exactly_,\" faltered Anne. \"At least, I don't believe it in\ndaylight. But after dark, Marilla, it's different. That is when ghosts\nwalk.\"\n\"There are no such things as ghosts, Anne.\"\n\"Oh, but there are, Marilla,\" cried Anne eagerly. \"I know people who\nhave seen them. And they are respectable people. Charlie Sloane says\nthat his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night\nafter he'd been buried for a year. You know Charlie Sloane's grandmother\nwouldn't tell a story for anything. She's a very religious woman. And\nMrs. Thomas's father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with\nits head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. He said he knew it was the\nspirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine\ndays. He didn't, but he died two years after, so you see it was really\ntrue. And Ruby Gillis says--\"\n\"Anne Shirley,\" interrupted Marilla firmly, \"I never want to hear you\ntalking in this fashion again. I've had my doubts about that imagination\nof yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, I\nwon't countenance any such doings. You'll go right over to Barry's, and\nyou'll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to\nyou. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods\nagain.\"\nAnne might plead and cry as she liked--and did, for her terror was very\nreal. Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce\ngrove in mortal dread after nightfall. But Marilla was inexorable. She\nmarched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her\nto proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of\nwailing ladies and headless specters beyond.\n\"Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?\" sobbed Anne. \"What would you\nfeel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?\"\n\"I'll risk it,\" said Marilla unfeelingly. \"You know I always mean what I\nsay. I'll cure you of imagining ghosts into places. March, now.\"",

Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other.\nI tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips\nmade me sit with Gil--with a boy; and the time he spelled my name\nwithout an 'e' on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce\nhe ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he\nhad been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, Marilla, and I\njust had to cry too.

Not exactly regally lovely,\nof course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally\nlovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the\nminister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she\ndresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue\nmuslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.\nJane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for\na minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark,\nMarilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides,\nshe's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should\nmake allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde\nuntil the manse is ready.\"\nIf Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde's that evening, was actuated by\nany motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had\nborrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most\nof the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes\nnever expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the\nborrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife,\nwas a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement\nwhere sensations were few and far between.\nOld Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in\nimagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a\nwidower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that\ngossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year\nof his sojourn. In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and\ndeparted amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection\nborn of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his\nshortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a\nvariety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various\ncandidates and \"supplies\" who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on\ntrial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers\nin Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the\ncorner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and\ndiscussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from\nprinciple to criticize ministers in any shape or form.\n\"I don't think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew\" was Anne's final\nsumming up. \"Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his\nworst fault was just like Mr. Bentley's--he had no imagination. And Mr.\nTerry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in\nthe matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology\nwasn't sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,\nbut he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church;\nhe was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,\nmustn't you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive;\nbut Mrs. Lynde says he isn't married, or even engaged, because she made\nspecial inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have\na young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the\ncongregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing\nwoman, isn't she, Matthew? I'm very glad they've called Mr. Allan. I\nliked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he\nmeant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.\nMrs. Lynde says he isn't perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn't\nexpect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year,\nand anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly\non all the points of doctrine. And she knows his wife's people and they\nare most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde\nsays that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman\nmake an ideal combination for a minister's family.\"\nThe new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still\non their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for\ntheir chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start.",

I'd love to do something for\nMrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.\"\n\"You can make a layer cake,\" promised Marilla.\nMonday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables.\nHaving the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important\nundertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of\nthe Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She\ntalked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they\nsat on the big red stones by the Dryad's Bubble and made rainbows in the\nwater with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.\n\"Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I'm to make in the\nmorning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just\nbefore teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy\ntwo days of it. It's such a responsibility having a minister's family to\ntea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see\nour pantry. It's a sight to behold. We're going to have jellied chicken\nand cold tongue. We're to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and\nwhipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies,\nand fruit cake, and Marilla's famous yellow plum preserves that she\nkeeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and\nbiscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister",

I just grow cold when I think of my layer\ncake. Oh, Diana, what if it shouldn't be good! I dreamed last night that\nI was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a\nhead.\"\n\"It'll be good, all right,\" assured Diana, who was a very comfortable\nsort of friend. \"I'm sure that piece of the one you made that we had for\nlunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant.\"\n\"Yes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just\nwhen you especially want them to be good,\" sighed Anne, setting a\nparticularly well-balsamed twig afloat. \"However, I suppose I shall\njust have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh,\nlook, Diana, what a lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come\nout after we go away and take it for a scarf?\"\n\"You know there is no such thing as a dryad,\" said Diana. Diana's mother\nhad found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over\nit. As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights\nof imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of\nbelief even in harmless dryads.\n\"But it's so easy to imagine there is,\" said Anne. \"Every night before\nI go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really\nsitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes\nI look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don't\ngive up your faith in the dryad!\"\nWednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too\nexcited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of\nher dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short\nof absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary\nmatters that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake.\nWhen she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.\n\"I'm sure I haven't forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you\nthink it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good? I\nused it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of\ngetting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated.\nMrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says\nwe'll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what\nif that cake doesn't rise?\"\n\"We'll have plenty without it\" was Marilla's unimpassioned way of\nlooking at the subject.\nThe cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and\nfeathery as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together\nwith layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it\nand possibly asking for another piece!\n\"You'll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,\" she said. \"Can I\nfix the table with ferns and wild roses?\"\n\"I think that's all nonsense,\" sniffed Marilla. \"In my opinion it's the\neatables that matter and not flummery decorations.\"\n\"Mrs. Barry had _her_ table decorated,\" said Anne, who was not entirely\nguiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, \"and the minister paid her an\nelegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the\npalate.\"\n\"Well, do as you like,\" said Marilla, who was quite determined not to\nbe surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. \"Only mind you leave enough\nroom for the dishes and the food.\"\nAnne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that\nshould leave Mrs. Barry's nowhere. Having abundance of roses and ferns\nand a very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a\nthing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they\nexclaimed in chorus over it loveliness.\n\"It's Anne's doings,\" said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs.\nAllan's approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.\nMatthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness\nand Anne knew how. He had been in such a state of shyness and\nnervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him\nin hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes\nand white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.\nHe never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be\nexpected.\nAll went merry as a marriage bell until Anne's layer cake was passed.\nMrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety,\ndeclined it. But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne's face, said\nsmilingly:\n\"Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose\nfor you.\"\n\"In that case I must sample it,\" laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to\na plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.\nMrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression\ncrossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away\nat it. Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.\n\"Anne Shirley!\" she exclaimed, \"what on earth did you put into that\ncake?\"\n\"Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla,\" cried Anne with a look of\nanguish. \"Oh, isn't it all right?\"\n\"All right! It's simply horrible. Mr. Allan, don't try to eat it. Anne,\ntaste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?\"\n\"Vanilla,\" said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting\nthe cake. \"Only vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking\npowder. I had my suspicions of that bak--\"\n\"Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you\nused.\"\nAnne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially\nfilled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, \"Best Vanilla.\"\nMarilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.\n\"Mercy on us, Anne, you've flavored that cake with _Anodyne Liniment_. I\nbroke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an\nold empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it's partly my fault--I should have\nwarned you--but for pity's sake why couldn't you have smelled it?\"\nAnne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.\n\"I couldn't--I had such a cold!\" and with this she fairly fled to the",

She had come\ndancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow\nsunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening.\n\"No, Marilla, but oh, what do you think?

      "text": "Anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of\n\"etiquette,\" for she came home through the twilight, under a great,\nhigh-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in\na beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting\non the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly\nhead in Marilla's gingham lap.\nA cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims\nof firry western hills and whistling through the poplars. One clear star\nhung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover's\nLane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them\nas she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were\nall tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.\n\"Oh, Marilla, I've had a most _fascinating_ time. I feel that I have not\nlived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never\nbe invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me\nat the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy,\nwith dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a\nseraph. I really think I'd like to be a minister's wife when I grow up,\nMarilla. A minister mightn't mind my red hair because he wouldn't be\nthinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to\nbe naturally good and I'll never be that, so I suppose there's no use in\nthinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others\nare not. I'm one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I'm full of original\nsin. No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success\nof it as those who are naturally good. It's a good deal like geometry,\nI expect. But don't you think the trying so hard ought to count for\nsomething? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her\npassionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs.\nAllan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are\nothers, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You\nknow you _ought_ to love them because they know so much and are such\nactive workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of\nit all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the\nmanse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her name was Laurette\nBradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred\nspirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I\nthink I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs.\nAllan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too.\nMrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the\nSunday-school choir after this. You can't think how I was thrilled at\nthe mere thought. I've longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir,\nas Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to.\nLauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the\nWhite Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta\nsays that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in\naid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White\nSands people to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself\nsomeday. I just gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I\nhad a heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything--about Mrs. Thomas and\nthe twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and\nmy troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs.\nAllan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don't know how that\nencouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what\ndo you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it's\na lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn't that a romantic name? Mrs.\nLynde says they've never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she\nthinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid\nto have a lady teacher, and I really don't see how I'm going to live\nthrough the two weeks before school begins. I'm so impatient to see\nher.\"",

You\nfind out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came\nto see me, and he's really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of\ncourse; but still I like him and I'm awfully sorry I ever criticized his\nprayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into\nthe habit of saying them as if he didn't. He could get over that if he'd\ntake a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard\nI tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me\nall about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem\nso strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my\nimagination has its limits, for I can't imagine _that_. When I try to\nimagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just\nas he looks in Sunday school, only small. Now, it's so easy to imagine\nMrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen\ntimes. Isn't that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a minister's\nwife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to\nhave visit you, too. She never tells you it's your own fault and she\nhopes you'll be a better girl on account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told\nme that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that\nmade me feel she might hope I'd be a better girl but didn't really\nbelieve I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her as\npolitely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk\na ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden\nof remorse all her life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She's been\nover every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad\nwhen I can go to school for I've heard such exciting things about the\nnew teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she\nhas the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses\nbeautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else's in\nAvonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody\nhas to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it's just glorious to\nthink of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie\nhas so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are\npreparing a dialogue, called 'A Morning Visit,' for next Friday. And the\nFriday afternoons they don't have recitations Miss Stacy takes them\nall to the woods for a 'field' day and they study ferns and flowers\nand birds. And they have physical culture exercises every morning and\nevening. Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all\ncomes of having a lady teacher. But I think it must be splendid and I\nbelieve I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit.\"",

I'm in two dialogues--'The\nSociety for the Suppression of Gossip' and 'The Fairy Queen.' The boys\nare going to have a dialogue too. And I'm to have two recitations,\nMarilla. I just tremble when I think of it, but it's a nice thrilly kind\nof tremble. And we're to have a tableau at the last--'Faith, Hope and\nCharity.' Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with\nflowing hair. I'm to be Hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes\nuplifted. I'm going to practice my recitations in the garret.

She wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been\nridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy\nqueens must be slender. Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be\none of her maids of honor. Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is\njust as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie\nsays. I'm to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis\nis going to lend me her slippers because I haven't any of my own. It's\nnecessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You couldn't imagine\na fairy wearing boots, could you? Especially with copper toes? We are\ngoing to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with\npink tissue-paper roses in them.

If Matthew knew there was\nsuch a thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he did; but he was\nquite sure that Anne's sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the\nother girls wore. He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen\naround her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink\nand white--and he wondered why Marilla always kept her so plainly and\nsoberly gowned.\nOf course, it must be all right. Marilla knew best and Marilla was\nbringing her up. Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served\nthereby. But surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty\ndress--something like Diana Barry always wore. Matthew decided that\nhe would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an\nunwarranted putting in of his oar. Christmas was only a fortnight off.",

I've\nheld my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesn't want advice and she\nthinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all\nshe's an old maid. But that's always the way.

The firs\nin the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches\nand wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were\nstretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that\nwas glorious.

Long elbow cuffs, and\nabove them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of\nbrown-silk ribbon.\n\"That's a Christmas present for you, Anne,\" said Matthew shyly.\n\"Why--why--Anne, don't you like it?

The\nlittle hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but\nAnne was the bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in\nthe shape of Josie Pye, dared not deny.\n\"Oh, hasn't it been a brilliant evening?\" sighed Anne, when it was all\nover and she and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry\nsky.\n\"Everything went off very well,\" said Diana practically. \"I guess we\nmust have made as much as ten dollars. Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to\nsend an account of it to the Charlottetown papers.\"\n\"Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? It makes me thrill to\nthink of it. Your solo was perfectly elegant, Diana. I felt prouder than\nyou did when it was encored. I just said to myself, 'It is my dear bosom\nfriend who is so honored.'\"\n\"Well, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne. That sad one\nwas simply splendid.\"\n\"Oh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan called out my name I really\ncannot tell how I ever got up on that platform. I felt as if a million\neyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I\nwas sure I couldn't begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed\nsleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves,\nDiana. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so\nfar away. I just felt like a parrot. It's providential that I practiced\nthose recitations so often up in the garret, or I'd never have been able\nto get through. Did I groan all right?\"\n\"Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely,\" assured Diana.\n\"I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down. It was\nsplendid to think I had touched somebody's heart. It's so romantic\nto take part in a concert, isn't it? Oh, it's been a very memorable\noccasion indeed.\"",

I'm trying to\nbe as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she's perfect.\nMr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she\ntreads on and she doesn't really think it right for a minister to\nset his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even\nministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody\nelse. I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting\nsins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it's proper\nto talk about on Sundays and that is one of them. My besetting sin is\nimagining too much and forgetting my duties.

I shall wait until I'm seventeen.\"\n\"If I had Alice Bell's crooked nose,\" said Anne decidedly, \"I\nwouldn't--but there! I won't say what I was going to because it was\nextremely uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and\nthat's vanity. I'm afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I\nheard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to\nme.

The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to write a\nstory out of our own heads!\"\n\"Why, it's as easy as wink,\" said Anne.\n\"It's easy for you because you have an imagination,\" retorted Diana,\n\"but what would you do if you had been born without one? I suppose you\nhave your composition all done?\"\nAnne nodded, trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing\nmiserably.\n\"I wrote it last Monday evening. It's called 'The Jealous Rival; or In\nDeath Not Divided.' I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and\nnonsense. Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine. That is\nthe kind of critic I like. It's a sad, sweet story. I just cried like\na child while I was writing it. It's about two beautiful maidens called\nCordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village\nand were devotedly attached to each other. Cordelia was a regal brunette\nwith a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes. Geraldine was\na queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.\"\n\"I never saw anybody with purple eyes,\" said Diana dubiously.\n\"Neither did I. I just imagined them. I wanted something out of the\ncommon. Geraldine had an alabaster brow too. I've found out what an\nalabaster brow is. That is one of the advantages of being thirteen. You\nknow so much more than you did when you were only twelve.\"\n\"Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?\" asked Diana, who was\nbeginning to feel rather interested in their fate.\n\"They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen. Then Bertram\nDeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair\nGeraldine. He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a\ncarriage, and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three\nmiles; because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up. I found\nit rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to\ngo by. I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed\nbecause I thought she'd likely be an authority on the subject, having so\nmany sisters married. Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when\nMalcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan. She said Malcolm told Susan\nthat his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, 'What\ndo you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?' And Susan said,\n'Yes--no--I don't know--let me see'--and there they were, engaged as\nquick as that. But I didn't think that sort of a proposal was a very\nromantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could.\nI made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees,\nalthough Ruby Gillis says it isn't done nowadays. Geraldine accepted\nhim in a speech a page long. I can tell you I took a lot of trouble\nwith that speech. I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my\nmasterpiece. Bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace\nand told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour, for he was\nimmensely wealthy. But then, alas, shadows began to darken over their\npath. Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when\nGeraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious,\nespecially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring. All her\naffection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she\nshould never marry Bertram. But she pretended to be Geraldine's friend\nthe same as ever. One evening they were standing on the bridge over a\nrushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were alone, pushed\nGeraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, 'Ha, ha, ha.' But Bertram\nsaw it all and he at once plunged into the current, exclaiming, 'I\nwill save thee, my peerless Geraldine.' But alas, he had forgotten he\ncouldn't swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other's arms.\nTheir bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the\none grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana. It's so much\nmore romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding. As for\nCordelia, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic\nasylum. I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime.\"\n\"How perfectly lovely!\" sighed Diana, who belonged to Matthew's school\nof critics. \"I don't see how you can make up such thrilling things out\nof your own head, Anne. I wish my imagination was as good as yours.\"",

Miss Josephine Barry\nwrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life. That\nkind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost\neverybody died.

Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that\nwhen he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt's pantry\nand she never had any respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldn't\nhave felt that way.

You've taken half an hour longer than\nyou should with all your chattering. Learn to work first and talk\nafterwards.\"",

I counted\nthe cost, Marilla. Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to\nmake up for it.\"\n\"Well,\" said Marilla sarcastically, \"if I'd decided it was worth while\nto dye my hair I'd have dyed it a decent color at least. I wouldn't have\ndyed it green.\"\n\"But I didn't mean to dye it green, Marilla,\" protested Anne dejectedly.\n\"If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose. He said it would\nturn my hair a beautiful raven black--he positively assured me that it\nwould. How could I doubt his word, Marilla? I know what it feels like\nto have your word doubted. And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect\nanyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they're\nnot. I have proof now--green hair is proof enough for anybody. But I\nhadn't then and I believed every word he said _implicitly_.\"",

I bought the dye from him.\"\n\"Anne Shirley, how often have I told you never to let one of those\nItalians in the house! I don't believe in encouraging them to come\naround at all.\"\n\"Oh, I didn't let him in the house. I remembered what you told me, and I\nwent out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his things on the step.\nBesides, he wasn't an Italian--he was a German Jew. He had a big box\nfull of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to\nmake enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany. He\nspoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy\nsomething from him to help him in such a worthy object. Then all at once\nI saw the bottle of hair dye. The peddler said it was warranted to dye\nany hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn't wash off. In a trice I\nsaw myself with beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was\nirresistible. But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I\nhad only fifty cents left out of my chicken money. I think the peddler\nhad a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, he'd sell it\nfor fifty cents and that was just giving it away. So I bought it, and as\nsoon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush\nas the directions said. I used up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla,\nwhen I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being\nwicked, I can tell you. And I've been repenting ever since.\"\n\"Well, I hope you'll repent to good purpose,\" said Marilla severely,\n\"and that you've got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you,\nAnne. Goodness knows what's to be done. I suppose the first thing is to\ngive your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good.\"\nAccordingly, Anne washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and\nwater, but for all the difference it made she might as well have been\nscouring its original red. The peddler had certainly spoken the truth\nwhen he declared that the dye wouldn't wash off, however his veracity\nmight be impeached in other respects.",

They had studied\nTennyson's poem in school the preceding winter, the Superintendent of\nEducation having prescribed it in the English course for the Prince\nEdward Island schools. They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to\npieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all\nleft in it for them, but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and\nGuinevere and King Arthur had become very real people to them, and Anne\nwas devoured by secret regret that she had not been born in Camelot.\nThose days, she said, were so much more romantic than the present.\nAnne's plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if\nthe flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down\nwith the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another\nheadland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond. They had often\ngone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing\nElaine.\n\"Well, I'll be Elaine,\" said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for, although\nshe would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet\nher artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her\nlimitations made impossible. \"Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane\nwill be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot. But first you must be the\nbrothers and the father. We can't have the old dumb servitor because\nthere isn't room for two in the flat when one is lying down. We must\npall the barge all its length in blackest samite. That old black shawl\nof your mother's will be just the thing, Diana.\"",

Do you suppose it's\nreally right to act like this? Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is\nabominably wicked.\"\n\"Ruby, you shouldn't talk about Mrs. Lynde,\" said Anne severely. \"It\nspoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde\nwas born. Jane, you arrange this. It's silly for Elaine to be talking\nwhen she's dead.\"\nJane rose to the occasion. Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none,\nbut an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent\nsubstitute. A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of\na tall blue iris placed in one of Anne's folded hands was all that could\nbe desired.\n\"Now, she's all ready,\" said Jane. \"We must kiss her quiet brows\nand, Diana, you say, 'Sister, farewell forever,' and Ruby, you say,\n'Farewell, sweet sister,' both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly\ncan. Anne, for goodness sake smile a little. You know Elaine 'lay as\nthough she smiled.' That's better. Now push the flat off.\"\nThe flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old\nembedded stake in the process. Diana and Jane and Ruby only waited long\nenough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before\nscampering up through the woods, across the road, and down to the lower\nheadland where, as Lancelot and Guinevere and the King, they were to be\nin readiness to receive the lily maid.\nFor a few minutes Anne, drifting slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her\nsituation to the full. Then something happened not at all romantic. The\nflat began to leak. In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine\nto scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall\nof blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her\nbarge through which the water was literally pouring. That sharp stake at\nthe landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat. Anne\ndid not know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was\nin a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long\nbefore it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left",

Here Ruby Gillis had\nsuccumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she\nmight, while Jane and Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the\nbrook to Green Gables. There they had found nobody either, for Marilla\nhad gone to Carmody and Matthew was making hay in the back field.\n\"Oh, Anne,\" gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former's neck\nand weeping with relief and delight, \"oh, Anne--we thought--you\nwere--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because we had made--you\nbe--Elaine. And Ruby is in hysterics--oh, Anne, how did you escape?\"\n\"I climbed up on one of the piles,\" explained Anne wearily, \"and Gilbert\nBlythe came along in Mr. Andrews's dory and brought me to land.\"\n\"Oh, Anne, how splendid of him! Why, it's so romantic!\" said Jane,\nfinding breath enough for utterance at last. \"Of course you'll speak to\nhim after this.\"\n\"Of course I won't,\" flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old\nspirit. \"And I don't want ever to hear the word 'romantic' again, Jane\nAndrews. I'm awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls. It is all my\nfault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do\ngets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We've gone and lost your\nfather's flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we'll not be\nallowed to row on the pond any more.\"\nAnne's presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt\nto do. Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households\nwhen the events of the afternoon became known.\n\"Will you ever have any sense, Anne?\" groaned Marilla.\n\"Oh, yes, I think I will, Marilla,\" returned Anne optimistically. A good\ncry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed\nher nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness. \"I think my\nprospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever.\"\n\"I don't see how,\" said Marilla.\n\"Well,\" explained Anne, \"I've learned a new and valuable lesson today.\nEver since I came to Green Gables I've been making mistakes, and each\nmistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The affair of\nthe amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn't belong\nto me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run\naway with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in\ncooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair\nand nose now--at least, very seldom. And today's mistake is going to\ncure me of being too romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it is\nno use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in\ntowered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated\nnow. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me\nin this respect, Marilla.\"\n\"I'm sure I hope so,\" said Marilla skeptically.\nBut Matthew, who had been sitting mutely in his corner, laid a hand on\nAnne's shoulder when Marilla had gone out.\n\"Don't give up all your romance, Anne,\" he whispered shyly, \"a little\nof it is a good thing--not too much, of course--but keep a little of it,\nAnne, keep a little of it.\"",

It is ever so\nmuch easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable. At least, it is\neasier for me. I suppose it doesn't make such a difference to naturally\ngood people.

I don't really know which department was the\nmost interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the\nfancywork best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was\nreal glad she did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I'm\nimproving, don't you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie's\nsuccess? Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples\nand Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig. Diana said she thought it was\nridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs,\nbut I don't see why. Do you? She said she would always think of it after\nthis when he was praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a\nprize for painting, and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter\nand cheese. So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn't it? Mrs.\nLynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her\nuntil I saw her familiar face among all those strangers. There\nwere thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel dreadfully\ninsignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see\nthe horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn't go; she said horse racing was an\nabomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty\nto set a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I\ndon't believe Mrs. Lynde's absence would ever be noticed. I don't think,\nthough, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_\nawfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me\nten cents that the red horse would win. I didn't believe he would, but\nI refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about\neverything, and I felt sure it wouldn't do to tell her that. It's always\nwrong to do anything you can't tell the minister's wife. It's as good as\nan extra conscience to have a minister's wife for your friend. And I was\nvery glad I didn't bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and I would have\nlost ten cents. So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a man\ngo up in a balloon. I'd love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would\nbe simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten\ncents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you. Miss Barry gave\nDiana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told. Mine was that I\nwould marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go\nacross water to live. I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after\nthat, but I didn't care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose\nit's too early to be looking out for him yet. Oh, it was a\nnever-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla. I was so tired I couldn't sleep at\nnight. Miss Barry put us in the spare room, according to promise. It\nwas an elegant room, Marilla, but somehow sleeping in a spare room isn't\nwhat I used to think it was. That's the worst of growing up, and I'm",

Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen,\nwhere a hot supper was waiting on the table.\n\"So you've got back?\" said Marilla, folding up her knitting.\n\"Yes, and oh, it's so good to be back,\" said Anne joyously. \"I could\nkiss everything, even to the clock. Marilla, a broiled chicken! You\ndon't mean to say you cooked that for me!\"\n\"Yes, I did,\" said Marilla. \"I thought you'd be hungry after such\na drive and need something real appetizing. Hurry and take off your\nthings, and we'll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in. I'm glad\nyou've got back, I must say. It's been fearful lonesome here without\nyou, and I never put in four longer days.\"\nAfter supper Anne sat before the fire between Matthew and Marilla, and\ngave them a full account of her visit.\n\"I've had a splendid time,\" she concluded happily, \"and I feel that it\nmarks an epoch in my life.

I was so interested in it\nthat I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at\nonce I just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so\nreproachful-like. I can't tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla,\nespecially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur\naway, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and\ntalked to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I\nwas wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly,\nI was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a\nhistory when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that\nmoment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I\ncried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I'd never do such\na thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking\nat Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned\nout.

Diana Barry did not, as her parents\ndid not intend to send her to Queen's. This seemed nothing short of a\ncalamity to Anne. Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the\ncroup, had she and Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when\nthe Queen's class first remained in school for the extra lessons and\nAnne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through\nthe Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep\nher seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. A lump\ncame into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her\nuplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. Not for worlds\nwould Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears.\n\"But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of\ndeath, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go\nout alone,\" she said mournfully that night. \"I thought how splendid it\nwould have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance,\ntoo. But we can't have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs.\nLynde says. Mrs. Lynde isn't exactly a comforting person sometimes, but\nthere's no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the\nQueen's class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby\nare just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their\nambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets\nthrough, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote\nher whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid\na salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything, and growls\nif you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks\nfrom mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a\nperfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she\nis just going to college for education's sake, because she won't have to\nearn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who\nare living on charity--_they_ have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to\nbe a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn't be anything else with a name\nlike that to live up to. I hope it isn't wicked of me, Marilla, but\nreally the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.\nHe's such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little\nblue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will\nbe more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he's\ngoing to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde\nsays he'll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest\npeople, and it's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.\"",

Previously the\nrivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt\nthat Gilbert was as determined to be first in class as Anne was. He was\na foeman worthy of her steel. The other members of the class tacitly\nacknowledged their superiority, and never dreamed of trying to compete\nwith them.\nSince the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea\nfor forgiveness, Gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry,\nhad evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of Anne Shirley. He\ntalked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with\nthem, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the\nother of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley\nhe simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be\nignored. It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head\nthat she did not care. Deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart\nshe knew that she did care, and that if she had that chance of the Lake\nof Shining Waters again she would answer very differently. All at\nonce, as it seemed, and to her secret dismay, she found that the old\nresentment she had cherished against him was gone--gone just when she\nmost needed its sustaining power. It was in vain that she recalled every\nincident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel\nthe old satisfying anger. That day by the pond had witnessed its last\nspasmodic flicker. Anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten\nwithout knowing it. But it was too late.\nAnd at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should\never suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn't been\nso proud and horrid! She determined to \"shroud her feelings in deepest\noblivion,\" and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so\nsuccessfully that Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as\nhe seemed, could not console himself with any belief that Anne felt his\nretaliatory scorn. The only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed\nCharlie Sloane, unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly.",

I've\nhad a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I'm rejoicing as a\nstrong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesn't Mr.\nAllan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every\nday and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up\nand then we'll be left and have to turn to and break in another green\npreacher. But I don't see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you,\nMarilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we\nhave him. If I were a man I think I'd be a minister. They can have\nsuch an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be\nthrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers' hearts. Why\ncan't women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was\nshocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might\nbe female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank\ngoodness we hadn't got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we\nnever would. But I don't see why. I think women would make splendid\nministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or\nanything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work.\nI'm sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell\nand I've no doubt she could preach too with a little practice.\"\n\"Yes, I believe she could,\" said Marilla dryly. \"She does plenty of\nunofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong\nin Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.\"\n\"Marilla,\" said Anne in a burst of confidence, \"I want to tell you\nsomething and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me\nterribly--on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about\nsuch matters. I do really want to be good; and when I'm with you or Mrs.\nAllan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what\nwould please you and what you would approve of. But mostly when I'm with\nMrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the\nvery thing she tells me I oughtn't to do. I feel irresistibly tempted\nto do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you\nthink it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?\"\nMarilla looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.\n\"If you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very\neffect on me. I sometimes think she'd have more of an influence for\ngood, as you say yourself, if she didn't keep nagging people to do\nright. There should have been a special commandment against nagging.\nBut there, I shouldn't talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she\nmeans well. There isn't a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks\nher share of work.\"\n\"I'm very glad you feel the same,\" said Anne decidedly. \"It's so\nencouraging. I shan't worry so much over that after this. But I dare say\nthere'll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the\ntime--things to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and\nthere's another right after. There are so many things to be thought over\nand decided when you're beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the\ntime thinking them over and deciding what is right. It's a serious thing\nto grow up, isn't it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as\nyou and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up\nsuccessfully, and I'm sure it will be my own fault if I don't. I feel\nit's a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I\ndon't grow up right I can't go back and begin over again. I've grown two\ninches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby's party. I'm\nso glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty\nand it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of course I know it\nwasn't really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie\nPye has flounces on all her dresses. I know I'll be able to study better\nbecause of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my\nmind about that flounce.\"",

Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and\nwished so much you were with me. I couldn't 'cram' because I'd promised\nMiss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history\nas it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were\nlearned.\n\"This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling\nfor Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands\nand they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn't slept\na wink and she didn't believe I was strong enough to stand the grind\nof the teacher's course even if I did get through. There are times and\nseasons even yet when I don't feel that I've made any great headway in\nlearning to like Josie Pye!\n\"When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from\nall over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting\non the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth\nhe was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over\nand over to steady his nerves and for pity's sake not to interrupt\nhim, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot\neverything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts\nfirmly in their proper place!\n\"When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and\nI sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of\nthe multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if\nI looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear\nacross the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English\nexamination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled\naround as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly\nas I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green\nGables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began\nbeating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I\nknew I could do something with _that_ paper anyhow.\n\"At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in\nthe afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully\nmixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh,\nDiana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it\nit takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my\nEuclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would\nrecite it from now till tomorrow morning.\n\"I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody\nSpurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in\nhistory and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he\nwas going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a\ncarpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to\nstay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn't.\nSometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon\nI'm always glad I'm a girl and not his sister.\n\"Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just\ndiscovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When\nshe recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had\nbeen with us.\n\"Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as\nMrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I\nfail in geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I\nthink I'd rather it didn't go on if I failed!\n\"Yours devotedly,\n\"Anne\"",

The\npass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt\nher. She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Diana\ncame rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even\nknocking, so great was her excitement.\n\"Anne, you've passed,\" she cried, \"passed the _very first_--you and\nGilbert both--you're ties--but your name is first. Oh, I'm so proud!\"\nDiana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne's bed, utterly\nbreathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp,\noversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her\nshaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper.\nYes, she had passed--there was her name at the very top of a list of two\nhundred! That moment was worth living for.\n\"You did just splendidly, Anne,\" puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently\nto sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a\nword. \"Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes\nago--it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won't be here\ntill tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over\nlike a wild thing. You've all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon\nand all, although he's conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty\nwell--they're halfway up--and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through\nwith three marks to spare, but you'll see she'll put on as many airs as\nif she'd led. Won't Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel\nlike to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were\nme I know I'd go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but\nyou're as calm and cool as a spring evening.\"\n\"I'm just dazzled inside,\" said Anne. \"I want to say a hundred things,\nand I can't find words to say them in. I never dreamed of this--yes, I\ndid too, just once! I let myself think _once_, 'What if I should come out\nfirst?' quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to\nthink I could lead the Island. Excuse me a minute, Diana. I must run\nright out to the field to tell Matthew. Then we'll go up the road and\ntell the good news to the others.\"\nThey hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling\nhay, and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at\nthe lane fence.\n\"Oh, Matthew,\" exclaimed Anne, \"I've passed and I'm first--or one of the\nfirst! I'm not vain, but I'm thankful.\"\n\"Well now, I always said it,\" said Matthew, gazing at the pass list\ndelightedly. \"I knew you could beat them all easy.\"\n\"You've done pretty well, I must say, Anne,\" said Marilla, trying to\nhide her extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel's critical eye. But that\ngood soul said heartily:\n\"I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in\nsaying it. You're a credit to your friends, Anne, that's what, and we're\nall proud of you.\"\nThat night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious\nlittle talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open\nwindow in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude\nand aspiration that came straight from her heart. There was in it\nthankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when\nshe slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and\nbeautiful as maidenhood might desire.",

      "text": "PUT on your white organdy, by all means, Anne,\" advised Diana\ndecidedly.\nThey were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only\ntwilight--a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless\nsky. A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into\nburnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet\nsummer sounds--sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway\nvoices and laughter. But in Anne's room the blind was drawn and the lamp\nlighted, for an important toilet was being made.\nThe east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that\nnight four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to\nthe marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept\nin, Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and\ndainty a nest as a young girl could desire.\nThe velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of\nAnne's early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams\nhad kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented\nthem. The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that\nsoftened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of\npale-green art muslin. The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade\ntapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few\ngood pictures given Anne by Mrs. Allan. Miss Stacy's photograph occupied\nthe place of honor, and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh\nflowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly\nperfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance. There was no \"mahogany\nfurniture,\" but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a\ncushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin,\na quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes\npainted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a\nlow white bed.\nAnne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had\ngot it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all\nthe available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it\nalong. Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir\nhad been asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a\nviolin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad;\nand Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to\nrecite.\nAs Anne would have said at one time, it was \"an epoch in her life,\" and\nshe was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in\nthe seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his\nAnne and Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather\nthan admit it, and said she didn't think it was very proper for a lot\nof young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible\nperson with them.\nAnne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother\nBilly in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and\nboys were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from\ntown, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.\n\"Do you really think the organdy will be best?\" queried Anne anxiously.\n\"I don't think it's as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it\ncertainly isn't so fashionable.\"\n\"But it suits you ever so much better,\" said Diana. \"It's so soft\nand frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too\ndressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.\"\nAnne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for\nnotable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much\nsought after. She was looking very pretty herself on this particular\nnight in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was\nforever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so\nher appearance was of minor importance. All her pains were bestowed upon\nAnne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and\ncombed and adorned to the Queen's taste.\n\"Pull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now\nfor your slippers. I'm going to braid your hair in two thick braids,\nand tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, don't pull out a single\ncurl over your forehead--just have the soft part. There is no way you do\nyour hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a\nMadonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose\njust behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for\nyou.\"\n\"Shall I put my pearl beads on?\" asked Anne. \"Matthew brought me a\nstring from town last week, and I know he'd like to see them on me.\"\nDiana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically,\nand finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied\naround Anne's slim milk-white throat.\n\"There's something so stylish about you, Anne,\" said Diana, with\nunenvious admiration. \"You hold your head with such an air. I suppose\nit's your figure. I am just a dumpling. I've always been afraid of it,\nand now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign\nmyself to it.\"\n\"But you have such dimples,\" said Anne, smiling affectionately into the\npretty, vivacious face so near her own. \"Lovely dimples, like little\ndents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream\nwill never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn't\ncomplain. Am I all ready now?\"\n\"All ready,\" assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt\nfigure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a\nmuch softer face. \"Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla.\nDoesn't she look lovely?\"\nMarilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.\n\"She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I\nexpect she'll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew\nwith it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy's the\nmost unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when\nhe got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays.\nTime was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for\nAnne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything\noff on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable,\nand Matthew plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear\nof the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.\"",

Somehow Anne--who did\nnot notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace\ngirl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied\ntherein if she had--got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front.\nShe was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each\nother's hands in nervous sympathy.\nAnne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as\nshe had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience\nas this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely.\nEverything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of\nladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of\nwealth and culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches\nat the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of\nfriends and neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless\ncritics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement\nfrom her \"rustic\" efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and\nmiserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness\ncame over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would\nhave fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt,\nmust ever after be her portion if she did so.\nBut suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the\naudience, she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending\nforward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once\ntriumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert\nwas merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and\nof the effect produced by Anne's slender white form and spiritual face\nagainst a background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had\ndriven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant\nand taunting. But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if\nshe had. She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage\nand determination tingling over her like an electric shock. She _would\nnot_ fail before Gilbert Blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her,\nnever, never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her\nrecitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of\nthe room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored\nto her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness\nshe recited as she had never done before. When she finished there were\nbursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing\nwith shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken\nby the stout lady in pink silk.\n\"My dear, you did splendidly,\" she puffed. \"I've been crying like a\nbaby, actually I have. There, they're encoring you--they're bound to\nhave you back!\"\n\"Oh, I can't go,\" said Anne confusedly. \"But yet--I must, or Matthew\nwill be disappointed. He said they would encore me.\"\n\"Then don't disappoint Matthew,\" said the pink lady, laughing.\nSmiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint,\nfunny little selection that captivated her audience still further. The\nrest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.",

      "text": "When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady--who was the wife of\nan American millionaire--took her under her wing, and introduced her\nto everybody; and everybody was very nice to her. The professional\nelocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that\nshe had a charming voice and \"interpreted\" her selections beautifully.\nEven the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had\nsupper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane\nwere invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne,\nbut Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear\nof some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team,\nhowever, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into\nthe calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked\ninto the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.\nOh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night!\nHow great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the\nsea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants\nguarding enchanted coasts.\n\"Hasn't it been a perfectly splendid time?\" sighed Jane, as they drove\naway. \"I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at\na hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and\nchicken salad every blessed day. I'm sure it would be ever so much\nmore fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great,\nalthough I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it\nwas better than Mrs. Evans's.\"\n\"Oh, no, don't say things like that, Jane,\" said Anne quickly, \"because\nit sounds silly. It couldn't be better than Mrs. Evans's, you know, for\nshe is a professional, and I'm only a schoolgirl, with a little knack\nof reciting. I'm quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty\nwell.\"\n\"I've a compliment for you, Anne,\" said Diana. \"At least I think it\nmust be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it\nwas anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a\nromantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he\nis a distinguished artist, and that her mother's cousin in Boston is\nmarried to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard\nhim say--didn't we, Jane?--'Who is that girl on the platform with the\nsplendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.' There now,\nAnne. But what does Titian hair mean?\"\n\"Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,\" laughed Anne. \"Titian\nwas a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.\"\n\"_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?\" sighed Jane. \"They\nwere simply dazzling. Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?\"\n\"We _are_ rich,\" said Anne staunchly. \"Why, we have sixteen years to our\ncredit, and we're happy as queens, and we've all got imaginations, more\nor less. Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of\nthings not seen. We couldn't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had\nmillions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldn't change into any\nof those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl\nand wear a sour look all your life, as if you'd been born turning up\nyour nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so\nstout and short that you'd really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans,\nwith that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully\nunhappy sometime to have such a look. You _know_ you wouldn't, Jane\nAndrews!\"\n\"I _don't_ know--exactly,\" said Jane unconvinced. \"I think diamonds would\ncomfort a person for a good deal.\"\n\"Well, I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by\ndiamonds all my life,\" declared Anne. \"I'm quite content to be Anne of\nGreen Gables, with my string of pearl beads.

Anne's outfit was\nample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made\nno objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested. More--one\nevening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate\npale green material.\n\"Anne, here's something for a nice light dress for you. I don't suppose\nyou really need it; you've plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe\nyou'd like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere\nof an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that\nJane and Ruby and Josie have got 'evening dresses,' as they call them,\nand I don't mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me\npick it in town last week, and we'll get Emily Gillis to make it for\nyou. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren't to be equaled.\"\n\"Oh, Marilla, it's just lovely,\" said Anne. \"Thank you so much. I don't\nbelieve you ought to be so kind to me--it's making it harder every day\nfor me to go away.\"\nThe green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings\nas Emily's taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew's\nand Marilla's benefit, and recited \"The Maiden's Vow\" for them in the\nkitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful\nmotions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green\nGables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child\nin her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking\nout of her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to\nMarilla's own eyes.\n\"I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,\" said Anne gaily\nstooping over Marilla's chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady's\ncheek. \"Now, I call that a positive triumph.\"\n\"No, I wasn't crying over your piece,\" said Marilla, who would have\nscorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. \"I just\ncouldn't help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. And\nI was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your\nqueer ways. You've grown up now and you're going away; and you look so\ntall and stylish and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if\nyou didn't belong in Avonlea at all--and I just got lonesome thinking it\nall over.\"\n\"Marilla!\" Anne sat down on Marilla's gingham lap, took Marilla's lined\nface between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla's\neyes. \"I'm not a bit changed--not really. I'm only just pruned down and\nbranched out. The real _me_--back here--is just the same. It won't make a\nbit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I\nshall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear\nGreen Gables more and better every day of her life.\"\nAnne laid her fresh young cheek against Marilla's faded one, and reached\nout a hand to pat Matthew's shoulder. Marilla would have given much just\nthen to have possessed Anne's power of putting her feelings into words;\nbut nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her\narms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing\nthat she need never let her go.\nMatthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went\nout-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked\nagitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.\n\"Well now, I guess she ain't been much spoiled,\" he muttered, proudly.\n\"I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all.\nShe's smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the\nrest. She's been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake\nthan what Mrs. Spencer made--if it _was_ luck. I don't believe it was any\nsuch thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her, I\nreckon.\"",

That first day passed pleasantly enough in a\nwhirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the\nprofessors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne\nintended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss\nStacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same. This meant getting a\nFirst Class teacher's license in one year instead of two, if they were\nsuccessful; but it also meant much more and harder work. Jane, Ruby,\nJosie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the\nstirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work.\nAnne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in\na room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the\ntall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion\nshe did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically.\nYet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old\nrivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what\nto do if it had been lacking.\n\"I wouldn't feel comfortable without it,\" she thought. \"Gilbert looks\nawfully determined.

Of course I promised Diana that\nno Queen's girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear\nto me as she is; but I've lots of second-best affections to bestow. I\nlike the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist.\nShe looks vivid and red-rosy; there's that pale, fair one gazing out of\nthe window.

Here there was nothing of this; Anne knew that\noutside of her window was a hard street, with a network of telephone\nwires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand\nlights gleaming on stranger faces. She knew that she was going to cry,\nand fought against it.\n\"I _won't_ cry. It's silly--and weak--there's the third tear splashing\ndown by my nose. There are more coming!

I've no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town's too\njolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so\nlong. You shouldn't cry, Anne; it isn't becoming, for your nose and eyes\nget red, and then you seem _all_ red. I'd a perfectly scrumptious time in\nthe Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache\nwould give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable\naround, Anne? I'm literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla 'd\nload you up with cake. That's why I called round. Otherwise I'd have\ngone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards\nsame place as I do, and he's a sport. He noticed you in class today, and\nasked me who the red-headed girl was. I told him you were an orphan that\nthe Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you'd\nbeen before that.\"\nAnne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more\nsatisfactory than Josie Pye's companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared,\neach with an inch of Queen's color ribbon--purple and scarlet--pinned\nproudly to her coat. As Josie was not \"speaking\" to Jane just then she\nhad to subside into comparative harmlessness.\n\"Well,\" said Jane with a sigh, \"I feel as if I'd lived many moons since\nthe morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old\nprofessor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply\ncouldn't settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the\ntraces of tears. If you've been crying _do_ own up. It will restore my\nself-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I\ndon't mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too. Cake?\nYou'll give me a teeny piece, won't you? Thank you. It has the real\nAvonlea flavor.\"\nRuby, perceiving the Queen's calendar lying on the table, wanted to know\nif Anne meant to try for the gold medal.\nAnne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it.\n\"Oh, that reminds me,\" said Josie, \"Queen's is to get one of the Avery\nscholarships after all. The word came today. Frank Stockley told me--his\nuncle is one of the board of governors, you know. It will be announced\nin the Academy tomorrow.\"",

For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt\nthat here her foot was on native heath.\nA wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his\nfortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed\namong the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces,\naccording to their respective standings. There had been much doubt\nwhether one would be allotted to Queen's, but the matter was settled at\nlast, and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark\nin English and English Literature would win the scholarship--two hundred\nand fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College.

Gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem\nthe sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed.\nThere was no silly sentiment in Anne's ideas concerning Gilbert.

She had a genius\nfor friendship; girl friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague\nconsciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing\nto round out one's conceptions of companionship and furnish broader\nstandpoints of judgment and comparison.

Diana, going to\nthe east gable, where Anne was standing at her window, said gently:\n\"Anne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?\"\n\"Thank you, Diana.\" Anne looked earnestly into her friend's face. \"I\nthink you won't misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone. I'm not\nafraid. I haven't been alone one minute since it happened--and I want to\nbe. I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it. I can't\nrealize it. Half the time it seems to me that Matthew can't be dead; and\nthe other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and\nI've had this horrible dull ache ever since.\"\nDiana did not quite understand. Marilla's impassioned grief, breaking\nall the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush,\nshe could comprehend better than Anne's tearless agony. But she went\naway kindly, leaving Anne alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow.\nAnne hoped that the tears would come in solitude. It seemed to her a\nterrible thing that she could not shed a tear for Matthew, whom she had\nloved so much and who had been so kind to her, Matthew who had walked\nwith her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below\nwith that awful peace on his brow. But no tears came at first, even when\nshe knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed, looking up to the\nstars beyond the hills--no tears, only the same horrible dull ache of\nmisery that kept on aching until she fell asleep, worn out with the\nday's pain and excitement.",

Martin will have to drive me in and there's ironing and\nbaking to do.\"\n\"I shall be all right. Diana will come over for company for me. I shall\nattend to the ironing and baking beautifully--you needn't fear that I'll\nstarch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment.\"\nMarilla laughed.\n\"What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, Anne. You were\nalways getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do\nyou mind the time you dyed your hair?\"\n\"Yes, indeed. I shall never forget it,\" smiled Anne, touching the heavy\nbraid of hair that was wound about her shapely head. \"I laugh a little\nnow sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me--but I\ndon't laugh _much_, because it was a very real trouble then. I did suffer\nterribly over my hair and my freckles. My freckles are really gone; and\npeople are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now--all but Josie\nPye. She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder\nthan ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked\nme if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. Marilla, I've\nalmost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye. I've made what I\nwould once have called a heroic effort to like her, but Josie Pye won't\n_be_ liked.\"\n\"Josie is a Pye,\" said Marilla sharply, \"so she can't help being\ndisagreeable. I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in\nsociety, but I must say I don't know what it is any more than I know the\nuse of thistles. Is Josie going to teach?\"\n\"No, she is going back to Queen's next year. So are Moody Spurgeon and\nCharlie Sloane. Jane and Ruby are going to teach and they have both got\nschools--Jane at Newbridge and Ruby at some place up west.\"\n\"Gilbert Blythe is going to teach too, isn't he?\"\n\"Yes\"--briefly.\n\"What a nice-looking fellow he is,\" said Marilla absently. \"I saw him in\nchurch last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. He looks a lot like\nhis father did at the same age. John Blythe was a nice boy. We used to\nbe real good friends, he and I. People called him my beau.\"\nAnne looked up with swift interest.\n\"Oh, Marilla--and what happened?--why didn't you--\"\n\"We had a quarrel. I wouldn't forgive him when he asked me to. I meant\nto, after awhile--but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him\nfirst. He never came back--the Blythes were all mighty independent. But\nI always felt--rather sorry. I've always kind of wished I'd forgiven him\nwhen I had the chance.\"\n\"So you've had a bit of romance in your life, too,\" said Anne softly.\n\"Yes, I suppose you might call it that. You wouldn't think so to look at\nme, would you? But you never can tell about people from their outsides.\nEverybody has forgot about me and John. I'd forgotten myself. But it all\ncame back to me when I saw Gilbert last Sunday.\"\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. The Bend in the road\nMARILLA went to town the next day and returned in the evening. Anne had\ngone over to Orchard Slope with Diana and came back to find Marilla in\nthe kitchen, sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand.\nSomething in her dejected attitude struck a chill to Anne's heart. She\nhad never seen Marilla sit limply inert like that.\n\"Are you very tired, Marilla?\"\n\"Yes--no--I don't know,\" said Marilla wearily, looking up. \"I suppose I\nam tired but I haven't thought about it. It's not that.\"\n\"Did you see the oculist? What did he say?\" asked Anne anxiously.\n\"Yes, I saw him. He examined my eyes. He says that if I give up all\nreading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes,\nand if I'm careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he's given me\nhe thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured.\nBut if I don't he says I'll certainly be stone-blind in six months.\nBlind! Anne, just think of it!\"\nFor a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was\nsilent. It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak. Then she said\nbravely, but with a catch in her voice:\n\"Marilla, _don't_ think of it. You know he has given you hope. If you are\ncareful you won't lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure\nyour headaches it will be a great thing.\"\n\"I don't call it much hope,\" said Marilla bitterly. \"What am I to live\nfor if I can't read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well\nbe blind--or dead. And as for crying, I can't help that when I get\nlonesome. But there, it's no good talking about it. If you'll get me\na cup of tea I'll be thankful. I'm about done out. Don't say anything\nabout this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can't bear that folks\nshould come here to question and sympathize and talk about it.\"",

Most of the good folks, not\nknowing about Marilla's eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did\nnot. She told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure\nto the girl's eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening\nand found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,\nscented summer dusk. They liked to sit there when the twilight came down\nand the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled\nthe dewy air.\nMrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the\ndoor, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a\nlong breath of mingled weariness and relief.\n\"I declare I'm getting glad to sit down. I've been on my feet all day,\nand two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It's\na great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well,\nAnne, I hear you've given up your notion of going to college. I was\nreal glad to hear it. You've got as much education now as a woman can be\ncomfortable with. I don't believe in girls going to college with the men\nand cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.\"\n\"But I'm going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde,\" said\nAnne laughing. \"I'm going to take my Arts course right here at Green\nGables, and study everything that I would at college.\"\nMrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.\n\"Anne Shirley, you'll kill yourself.\"\n\"Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I'm not going to overdo\nthings. As 'Josiah Allen's wife,' says, I shall be 'mejum'. But I'll\nhave lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I've no\nvocation for fancy work. I'm going to teach over at Carmody, you know.\"\n\"I don't know it. I guess you're going to teach right here in Avonlea.\nThe trustees have decided to give you the school.\"\n\"Mrs. Lynde!\" cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. \"Why, I\nthought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!\"\n\"So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it\nhe went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night,\nyou know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested\nthat they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of\ncourse he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must\nsay I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real\nself-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands,\nand everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the\ntrustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came\nhome and told me.\"\n\"I don't feel that I ought to take it,\" murmured Anne. \"I mean--I don't\nthink I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me.\"\n\"I guess you can't prevent him now.

It was very good of you--and I want you to\nknow that I appreciate it.\"\nGilbert took the offered hand eagerly.\n\"It wasn't particularly good of me at all, Anne. I was pleased to be\nable to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after\nthis? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?\"\nAnne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.\n\"I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn't know\nit. What a stubborn little goose I was. I've been--I may as well make a\ncomplete confession--I've been sorry ever since.\"\n\"We are going to be the best of friends,\" said Gilbert, jubilantly. \"We\nwere born to be good friends, Anne. You've thwarted destiny enough. I\nknow we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your\nstudies, aren't you? So am I. Come, I'm going to walk home with you.\"\nMarilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.\n\"Who was that came up the lane with you, Anne?\"\n\"Gilbert Blythe,\" answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing. \"I met\nhim on Barry's hill.\"\n\"I didn't think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you'd\nstand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,\" said Marilla with a\ndry smile.\n\"We haven't been--we've been good enemies. But we have decided that it\nwill be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. Were we\nreally there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see,\nwe have five years' lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla.\"\nAnne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content.\nThe wind purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came\nup to her. The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and\nDiana's light gleamed through the old gap.\nAnne's horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after\ncoming home from Queen's; but if the path set before her feet was to be\nnarrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it.\nThe joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship\nwere to be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her\nideal world of dreams. And there was always the bend in the road!",
