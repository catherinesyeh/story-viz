Their\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\nmany miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\nanother corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar\u2014except a\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\ncrush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\nhole.\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.",

There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the\nsouth, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the\ngrass coming from that direction also.\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\n\"There's a cyclone coming, Em,\" he called to his wife. \"I'll go look\nafter the stock.\" Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\nhorses were kept.\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of\nthe danger close at hand.\n\"Quick, Dorothy!\" she screamed. \"Run for the cellar!\"\nToto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl\nstarted to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door\nin the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole.",

They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\nbeards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\nstiffly.\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\ncome farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low\nbow and said, in a sweet voice:\n\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.\"\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\nlittle girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,\nwith hesitation, \"You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I\nhave not killed anything.\"\n\"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the little old woman, with a laugh,\n\"and that is the same thing. See!\" she continued, pointing to the\ncorner of the house. \"There are her two feet, still sticking out from\nunder a block of wood.\"\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\n\"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\ndismay. \"The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?\"\n\"There is nothing to be done,\" said the little woman calmly.\n\"But who was she?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\" answered the little\nwoman. \"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and\nare grateful to you for the favor.\"\n\"Who are the Munchkins?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\"They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked\nWitch ruled.\"\n\"Are you a Munchkin?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.\"",

Then she looked up and said, \"I do not\nknow where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned\nbefore. But tell me, is it a civilized country?\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Dorothy.\n\"Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there\nare no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,\nyou see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off\nfrom all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and\nwizards amongst us.\"\n\"Who are the wizards?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"Oz himself is the Great Wizard,\" answered the Witch, sinking her voice\nto a whisper. \"He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He\nlives in the City of Emeralds.\"\nDorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,\nwho had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the\ncorner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\n\"What is it?\" asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to\nlaugh.

At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was\nwritten in big, white chalk marks:\n\"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS\"\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the\nwords on it, asked, \"Is your name Dorothy, my dear?\"\n\"Yes,\" answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\n\"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.\"\n\"Where is this city?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\nGreat Wizard I told you of.\"\n\"Is he a good man?\" inquired the girl anxiously.\n\"He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\nhave never seen him.\"\n\"How can I get there?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use\nall the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\"\n\"Won't you go with me?\" pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon\nthe little old woman as her only friend.\n\"No, I cannot do that,\" she replied, \"but I will give you my kiss, and\nno one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of\nthe North.\"\nShe came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where\nher lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy\nfound out soon after.\n\"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\" said the\nWitch, \"so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.\"\nThe three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,\nafter which they walked away through the trees.

It was gingham, with checks of white\nand blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,\nit was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed\nherself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.\nShe took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,\nlaying a white cloth over the top.

Within a short time she was walking\nbriskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on\nthe hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang\nsweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a\nlittle girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own\ncountry and set down in the midst of a strange land.\nShe was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country\nwas about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted\na dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and\nvegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and\nable to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and\nthe people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for\neveryone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and\nsetting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were\nodd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.\nAll were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the\nfavorite color.\nToward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to\nwonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather\nlarger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women\nwere dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and\nthe people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was\nloaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other\ngood things to eat.\nThe people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to\npass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest\nMunchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to\ncelebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.\nDorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin\nhimself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the\npeople dance.\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, \"You must be a great sorceress.\"\n\"Why?\" asked the girl.\n\"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\nwear white.\"\n\"My dress is blue and white checked,\" said Dorothy, smoothing out the\nwrinkles in it.\n\"It is kind of you to wear that,\" said Boq. \"Blue is the color of the\nMunchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly\nwitch.\"\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to\nthink her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange\nland.\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made\nof blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with\nToto curled up on the blue rug beside her.",

It\nis better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business\nwith him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take\nyou many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass\nthrough rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your\njourney.\"\nThis worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz\ncould help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn\nback.\nShe bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of\nyellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far\naway she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from\nthe ripe corn.\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\nnose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue\nhat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and\nthe rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,\nwhich had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots\nwith blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure\nwas raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its\nback.\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.\nShe thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the\nscarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\n\"Good day,\" said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\n\"Did you speak?\" asked the girl, in wonder.\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"How do you do?\"\n\"I'm pretty well, thank you,\" replied Dorothy politely. \"How do you\ndo?\"\n\"I'm not feeling well,\" said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \"for it is\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\"\n\"Can't you get down?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\"\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\n\"Thank you very much,\" said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on\nthe ground. \"I feel like a new man.\"\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man\nspeak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and\nyawned. \"And where are you going?\"\n\"My name is Dorothy,\" said the girl, \"and I am going to the Emerald\nCity, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\"\n\"Where is the Emerald City?\" he inquired. \"And who is Oz?\"\n\"Why, don't you know?\" she returned, in surprise.\n\"No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no\nbrains at all,\" he answered sadly.\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy, \"I'm awfully sorry for you.\"\n\"Do you think,\" he asked, \"if I go to the Emerald City with you, that\nOz would give me some brains?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" she returned, \"but you may come with me, if you like.\nIf Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\nare now.\"\n\"That is true,\" said the Scarecrow. \"You see,\" he continued\nconfidentially, \"I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin\ninto me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\"\n\"I understand how you feel,\" said the little girl, who was truly sorry\nfor him. \"If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for\nyou.\"\n\"Thank you,\" he answered gratefully.\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats\nin the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\nScarecrow.\n\"Don't mind Toto,\" said Dorothy to her new friend. \"He never bites.\"\n\"Oh, I'm not afraid,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"He can't hurt the straw.\nDo let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can't\nget tired. I'll tell you a secret,\" he continued, as he walked along.\n\"There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.\"\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy; \"the Munchkin farmer who made you?\"",

So she told him all\nabout Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone\nhad carried her to this queer Land of Oz.\nThe Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, \"I cannot understand why\nyou should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry,\ngray place you call Kansas.\"\n\"That is because you have no brains\" answered the girl. \"No matter how\ndreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would\nrather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful.\nThere is no place like home.\"\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\n\"Of course I cannot understand it,\" he said. \"If your heads were\nstuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the\nbeautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is\nfortunate for Kansas that you have brains.\"\n\"Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?\" asked the child.\nThe Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\n\"My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that\ntime is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\nwas going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\nI heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'\n\"'They aren't straight,'\" answered the other.\n\"'Never mind,'\" said the farmer. \"'They are ears just the same,'\" which\nwas true enough.\n\"'Now I'll make the eyes,'\" said the farmer. So he painted my right\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\nfirst glimpse of the world.\n\"'That's a rather pretty eye,'\" remarked the Munchkin who was watching\nthe farmer. \"'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.'\n\"'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'\" said the farmer. And\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then\nhe made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time\nI didn't know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make\nmy body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at\nlast, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as\nanyone.\n\"'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer. 'He\nlooks just like a man.'\n\"'Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\naway and left me alone.\n\"I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on\nthat pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,\nhaving been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds\nflew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away\nagain, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel\nthat I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near\nme, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and\nsaid:\n\"'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any\ncrow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.' Then he\nhopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short\ntime there was a great flock of them about me.\n\"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, 'If you only had\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.'\n\"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\"",

They turned and walked through the forest a few\nsteps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine\nthat fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped\nshort, with a little cry of surprise.\nOne of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing\nbeside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely\nof tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.\nDorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while\nToto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his\nteeth.\n\"Did you groan?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"Yes,\" answered the tin man, \"I did. I've been groaning for more than a\nyear, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\"\n\"What can I do for you?\" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the\nsad voice in which the man spoke.\n\"Get an oil-can and oil my joints,\" he answered. \"They are rusted so\nbadly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.\"\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then\nshe returned and asked anxiously, \"Where are your joints?\"\n\"Oil my neck, first,\" replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as\nit was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and\nmoved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the\nman could turn it himself.\n\"Now oil the joints in my arms,\" he said. And Dorothy oiled them and\nthe Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust\nand as good as new.\nThe Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which\nhe leaned against the tree.\n\"This is a great comfort,\" he said. \"I have been holding that axe in\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at\nlast. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right\nonce more.\"\nSo they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked\nthem again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite\ncreature, and very grateful.\n\"I might have stood there always if you had not come along,\" he said;\n\"so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?\"\n\"We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,\" she\nanswered, \"and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.\"\n\"Why do you wish to see Oz?\" he asked.\n\"I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to\nput a few brains into his head,\" she replied.\nThe Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:\n\"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?\"\n\"Why, I guess so,\" Dorothy answered. \"It would be as easy as to give\nthe Scarecrow brains.\"\n\"True,\" the Tin Woodman returned. \"So, if you will allow me to join\nyour party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.\"\n\"Come along,\" said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she\nwould be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his\naxe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road\nthat was paved with yellow brick.",

But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe\nand chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire\nparty.\nDorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not\nnotice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the\nside of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up\nagain.\n\"Why didn't you walk around the hole?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"I don't know enough,\" replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. \"My head is\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\nhim for some brains.\"\n\"Oh, I see,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"But, after all, brains are not the\nbest things in the world.\"\n\"Have you any?\" inquired the Scarecrow.\n\"No, my head is quite empty,\" answered the Woodman. \"But once I had\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\nrather have a heart.\"\n\"And why is that?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"I will tell you my story, and then you will know.\"\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\nthe following story:\n\"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\nand sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a\nwoodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\nlong as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\n\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry\nme as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for\nher; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old\nwoman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\nhousework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.\nThereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\nleft leg.\n\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I\nwas used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for\nshe had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin\ngirl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right\nleg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of\ntin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;\nbut, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked\nWitch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I\nthought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come\nalong, and he made me a new head out of tin.\n\"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\ntwo halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\n\"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There\nwas only one danger\u2014that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in\nmy cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,\nthere came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a\nrainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I\nwas left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a\nterrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time\nto think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.\nWhile I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can\nlove who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\none. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.\"\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story\nof the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a\nnew heart.\n\"All the same,\" said the Scarecrow, \"I shall ask for brains instead of\na heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\none.\"\n\"I shall take the heart,\" returned the Tin Woodman; \"for brains do not\nmake one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\"\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her\ntwo friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to\nKansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had\nno brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.",

But now and then there\ncame a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These\nsounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know\nwhat made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side,\nand did not even bark in return.\n\"How long will it be,\" the child asked of the Tin Woodman, \"before we\nare out of the forest?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" was the answer, \"for I have never been to the Emerald\nCity. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it\nwas a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the\ncity where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so\nlong as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while\nyou bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that\nwill protect you from harm.\"\n\"But Toto!\" said the girl anxiously. \"What will protect him?\"\n\"We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,\" replied the Tin\nWoodman.\nJust as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the\nnext moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his\npaw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the\nroad, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But,\nto the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,\nalthough the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.\nLittle Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the\nLion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when",

But how can I help it?\"\n\"I don't know, I'm sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like\nthe poor Scarecrow!\"\n\"Is he stuffed?\" asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up\nthe Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into\nshape again.\n\"Of course he's stuffed,\" replied Dorothy, who was still angry.\n\"That's why he went over so easily,\" remarked the Lion. \"It astonished\nme to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?\"\n\"No,\" said Dorothy, \"he's made of tin.\" And she helped the Woodman up\nagain.\n\"That's why he nearly blunted my claws,\" said the Lion. \"When they\nscratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What\nis that little animal you are so tender of?\"\n\"He is my dog, Toto,\" answered Dorothy.\n\"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?\" asked the Lion.\n\"Neither. He's a\u2014a\u2014a meat dog,\" said the girl.\n\"Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look\nat him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a\ncoward like me,\" continued the Lion sadly.\n\"What makes you a coward?\" asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in\nwonder, for he was as big as a small horse.\n\"It's a mystery,\" replied the Lion. \"I suppose I was born that way. All\nthe other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for\nthe Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that\nif I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out\nof my way. Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just\nroared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If\nthe elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me,\nI should have run myself\u2014I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they\nhear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them\ngo.\"\n\"But that isn't right. The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward,\" said\nthe Scarecrow.\n\"I know it,\" returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip\nof his tail. \"It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.\nBut whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.\"\n\"Perhaps you have heart disease,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"It may be,\" said the Lion.\n\"If you have,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"you ought to be glad, for it\nproves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have\nheart disease.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" said the Lion thoughtfully, \"if I had no heart I should not\nbe a coward.\"\n\"Have you brains?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"I suppose so. I've never looked to see,\" replied the Lion.\n\"I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,\" remarked the\nScarecrow, \"for my head is stuffed with straw.\"\n\"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,\" said the Woodman.\n\"And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,\" added\nDorothy.\n\"Do you think Oz could give me courage?\" asked the Cowardly Lion.\n\"Just as easily as he could give me brains,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"Or give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"Or send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you,\" said the Lion, \"for my\nlife is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.\"\n\"You will be very welcome,\" answered Dorothy, \"for you will help to\nkeep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more\ncowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.\"\n\"They really are,\" said the Lion, \"but that doesn't make me any braver,\nand as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.\"",

Toto did not approve of\nthis new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had\nbeen crushed between the Lion's great jaws. But after a time he became\nmore at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be\ngood friends.\nDuring the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the\npeace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a\nbeetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little\nthing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always\ncareful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept\nseveral tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his\nface and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When\nDorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open\nhis mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly\nfrightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but\nshe could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was\nwrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's basket and\noiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as\nwell as before.\n\"This will serve me a lesson,\" said he, \"to look where I step. For if I\nshould kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying\nrusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.\"\nThereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and\nwhen he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to\nharm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore\nhe took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.\n\"You people with hearts,\" he said, \"have something to guide you, and\nneed never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very\ncareful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn't mind so much.\"",

She and Toto ate the last of\ntheir bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.\n\"If you wish,\" said the Lion, \"I will go into the forest and kill a\ndeer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very\ngood breakfast.\"\n\"Don't! Please don't,\" begged the Tin Woodman. \"I should certainly weep\nif you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.\"\nBut the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no\none ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it. And the Scarecrow\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\nas many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how\nlong it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away\nfrom the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn\nhim up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came\nnear to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep.

After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow\nbrick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would\ncome to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To\nadd to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths\nof the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part\nof the country that the Kalidahs lived.\n\"What are the Kalidahs?\" asked the girl.\n\"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\ntigers,\" replied the Lion, \"and with claws so long and sharp that they\ncould tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I'm terribly\nafraid of the Kalidahs.\"\n\"I'm not surprised that you are,\" returned Dorothy. \"They must be\ndreadful beasts.\"\nThe Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf\nacross the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew\nat once he could not leap across it.\nSo they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious\nthought the Scarecrow said:\n\"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman\ncan chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk\nacross it easily.\"\n\"That is a first-rate idea,\" said the Lion. \"One would almost suspect\nyou had brains in your head, instead of straw.\"\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree\nwas soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front\nlegs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big\ntree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top\nbranches on the other side.\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl\nmade them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them\ntwo great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\n\"They are the Kalidahs!\" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.\n\"Quick!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"Let us cross over.\"\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman\nfollowed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was\ncertainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud\nand terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over\nbackward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him\nin surprise.\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there\nwere two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed\nforward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they\nwould do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began\nto cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:\n\"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\nclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am\nalive.\"\n\"Wait a minute!\" called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was\nbest to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of\nthe tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began\nto use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly\nacross, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,\nsnarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp\nrocks at the bottom.",

Behind them was the dark forest\nthey had passed safely through, although they had suffered many\ndiscouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that\nseemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.\nTo be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.\nBut the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few\nmore logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready\nto start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in\nher arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,\nfor he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood\nupon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands\nto push the raft through the water.\nThey got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of\nthe river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and\nfarther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep\nthat the long poles would not touch the bottom.\n\"This is bad,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"for if we cannot get to the land\nwe shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,\nand she will enchant us and make us her slaves.\"\n\"And then I should get no brains,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"And I should get no courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.\n\"And I should get no heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"And I should never get back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\n\"We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,\" the Scarecrow\ncontinued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in\nthe mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out\nagain\u2014or let go\u2014the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was\nleft clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.\n\"Good-bye!\" he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave\nhim. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered\nthat he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.\nOf course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.\n\"I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,\" he thought. \"Then,\nI was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare\nthe crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow\nstuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never\nhave any brains, after all!\"\nDown the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far\nbehind. Then the Lion said:\n\"Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and\npull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my\ntail.\"\nSo he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of\nhis tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the\nshore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they\nwere drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's\nlong pole and helped push the raft to the land.\nThey were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped\noff upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had\ncarried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the\nEmerald City.\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on\nthe grass to let the sun dry him.\n\"We must get back to the road, in some way,\" said Dorothy.\n\"The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the\nroad again,\" remarked the Lion.\nSo, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they\nstarted along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had\ncarried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit\ntrees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for\nthe poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.",

Now it is well known that when\nthere are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that\nanyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried\naway from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But\nDorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red\nflowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy\nand she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.\nBut the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.\n\"We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,\"\nhe said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until\nDorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and\nshe forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.\n\"What shall we do?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"If we leave her here she will die,\" said the Lion. \"The smell of the\nflowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and\nthe dog is asleep already.\"\nIt was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not\ntroubled by the scent of the flowers.\n\"Run fast,\" said the Scarecrow to the Lion, \"and get out of this deadly\nflower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,\nbut if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.\"\nSo the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.\nIn a moment he was out of sight.\n\"Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,\" said the Scarecrow.\nSo they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they\nmade a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms\nand carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\nOn and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly\nflowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of\nthe river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast\nasleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge\nbeast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance\nfrom the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in\nbeautiful green fields before them.\n\"We can do nothing for him,\" said the Tin Woodman, sadly; \"for he is\nmuch too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and\nperhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the Scarecrow. \"The Lion was a very good comrade for\none so cowardly. But let us go on.\"\nThey carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far\nenough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the\npoison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass\nand waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.",

As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the\nbeast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he\nknew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,\nharmless creature.\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a\nquick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\n\"Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.\"\n\"Don't speak of it, I beg of you,\" replied the Woodman. \"I have no\nheart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a\nfriend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.\"\n\"Only a mouse!\" cried the little animal, indignantly. \"Why, I am a\nQueen\u2014the Queen of all the Field Mice!\"\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said the Woodman, making a bow.\n\"Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\nsaving my life,\" added the Queen.\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\nexclaimed:\n\"Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage\nto escape the great Wildcat?\" They all bowed so low to the little Queen\nthat they almost stood upon their heads.\n\"This funny tin man,\" she answered, \"killed the Wildcat and saved my\nlife.

At his side was a large green box.\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, \"What do you wish\nin the Emerald City?\"\n\"We came here to see the Great Oz,\" said Dorothy.\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\nover.\n\"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,\" he said,\nshaking his head in perplexity. \"He is powerful and terrible, and if\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.\"\n\"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,\" replied the\nScarecrow; \"it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\nWizard.\"\n\"So he is,\" said the green man, \"and he rules the Emerald City wisely\nand well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his\nface. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the\nGreat Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the\nspectacles.\"\n\"Why?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the\nEmerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear\nspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it\nwhen the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock\nthem.\"\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in\nthem. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast\nwith the key.\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he\nwas ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a\npeg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him\nthrough the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.",

            "text": "The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\ngreen ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room\nof the Great Oz.\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to\ndo but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\nOz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\nwhispered:\n\"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\"\n\"Of course,\" answered the girl, \"if he will see me.\"\n\"Oh, he will see you,\" said the soldier who had taken her message to\nthe Wizard, \"although he does not like to have people ask to see him.\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\ncame from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about\nthe mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his\npresence.\"\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, \"That is the\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\"\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\nwonderful manner.\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\nDorothy heard a voice say:\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\n\"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\"\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\nvoice:\n\"Where did you get the silver shoes?\"\n\"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\nher and killed her,\" she replied.\n\"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?\" continued the voice.\n\"That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\" said the girl.\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\ntruth. Then Oz asked, \"What do you wish me to do?\"\n\"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\" she\nanswered earnestly. \"I don't like your country, although it is so\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\nbeing away so long.\"\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\n\"Why should I do this for you?\" asked Oz.\n\"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\nand I am only a little girl.\"\n\"But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,\" said\nOz.\n\"That just happened,\" returned Dorothy simply; \"I could not help it.\"\n\"Well,\" said the Head, \"I will give you my answer. You have no right to\nexpect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in\nreturn. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If\nyou wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do\nsomething for me first. Help me and I will help you.\"\n\"What must I do?\" asked the girl.\n\"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\" answered Oz.\n\"But I cannot!\" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\n\"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\nbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all\nthis land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to\nKansas\u2014but not before.\"\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\nfelt that she could help him if she would.\n\"I never killed anything, willingly,\" she sobbed. \"Even if I wanted to,\nhow could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,\ncannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?\"\n\"I do not know,\" said the Head; \"but that is my answer, and until the\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember\nthat the Witch is Wicked\u2014tremendously Wicked\u2014and ought to be killed.\nNow go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.\"",

His first thought was\nthat Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he\ntried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his\nwhiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.\nThen a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the\nwords it spoke:\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.

            "text": "You will remember there was no road\u2014not even a pathway\u2014between the\ncastle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four\ntravelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so\nsent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to\nfind their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow\ndaisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go\nstraight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right\nway. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know\nwhich was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were\nlost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night\nthe moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet\nsmelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning\u2014all but the\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman.\nThe next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if\nthey were quite sure which way they were going.\n\"If we walk far enough,\" said Dorothy, \"I am sure we shall sometime\ncome to some place.\"\nBut day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but\nthe scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.\n\"We have surely lost our way,\" he said, \"and unless we find it again in\ntime to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.\"\n\"Nor I my heart,\" declared the Tin Woodman. \"It seems to me I can\nscarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long\njourney.\"\n\"You see,\" said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, \"I haven't the\ncourage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.\"\nThen Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her\ncompanions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that\nfor the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly\nthat flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked\nat Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.\n\"Suppose we call the field mice,\" she suggested. \"They could probably\ntell us the way to the Emerald City.\"\n\"To be sure they could,\" cried the Scarecrow. \"Why didn't we think of\nthat before?\"\nDorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck\nsince the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they\nheard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came\nrunning up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her\nsqueaky little voice:\n\"What can I do for my friends?\"\n\"We have lost our way,\" said Dorothy. \"Can you tell us where the\nEmerald City is?\"\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Queen; \"but it is a great way off, for you\nhave had it at your backs all this time.\" Then she noticed Dorothy's\nGolden Cap, and said, \"Why don't you use the charm of the Cap, and call\nthe Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in\nless than an hour.\"\n\"I didn't know there was a charm,\" answered Dorothy, in surprise. \"What\nis it?\"\n\"It is written inside the Golden Cap,\" replied the Queen of the Mice.\n\"But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for\nthey are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.\"\n\"Won't they hurt me?\" asked the girl anxiously.\n\"Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!\" And she\nscampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.\nDorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon\nthe lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the\ndirections carefully and put the Cap upon her head.\n\"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!\" she said, standing on her left foot.\n\"What did you say?\" asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was\ndoing.\n\"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!\" Dorothy went on, standing this time on her\nright foot.\n\"Hello!\" replied the Tin Woodman calmly.\n\"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\" said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.\nThis ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering\nand flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.\nThe King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, \"What is your command?\"\n\"We wish to go to the Emerald City,\" said the child, \"and we have lost\nour way.\"\n\"We will carry you,\" replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than\ntwo of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.\nOthers took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little\nMonkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to\nbite him.\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for\nthey remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;\nbut they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air\nquite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and\nwoods far below them.",

They thought the Great Wizard would send for them\nat once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor\nthe next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at\nlast they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion,\nafter sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow\nat last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if\nhe did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged\nMonkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.\nWhen the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he\nsent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after\nnine o'clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in\nthe Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.",

As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next\nmoment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in\njust the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head\nand a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.\nThe Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and\ncried out, \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\" said the little man, in a trembling\nvoice. \"But don't strike me\u2014please don't\u2014and I'll do anything you want\nme to.\"\nOur friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.\n\"I thought Oz was a great Head,\" said Dorothy.\n\"And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,\" exclaimed the Lion.\n\"No, you are all wrong,\" said the little man meekly. \"I have been\nmaking believe.\"\n\"Making believe!\" cried Dorothy. \"Are you not a Great Wizard?\"\n\"Hush, my dear,\" he said. \"Don't speak so loud, or you will be\noverheard\u2014and I should be ruined.

Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found\nout.\"\n\"Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No one knows it but you four\u2014and myself,\" replied Oz. \"I have fooled\neveryone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a\ngreat mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will\nnot see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.\"\n\"But, I don't understand,\" said Dorothy, in bewilderment. \"How was it\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?\"\n\"That was one of my tricks,\" answered Oz. \"Step this way, please, and I\nwill tell you all about it.\"\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and\nthey all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great\nHead, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully\npainted face.\n\"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,\" said Oz. \"I stood behind the\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.\"\n\"But how about the voice?\" she inquired.\n\"Oh, I am a ventriloquist,\" said the little man. \"I can throw the sound\nof my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of\nthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.\" He showed\nthe Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be\nthe lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was\nnothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their\nsides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also\nfrom the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was\npoured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\n\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for\nbeing such a humbug.\"\n\"I am\u2014I certainly am,\" answered the little man sorrowfully; \"but it was\nthe only thing I could do.

I can imitate any kind of a bird or\nbeast.\" Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears\nand looked everywhere to see where she was. \"After a time,\" continued\nOz, \"I tired of that, and became a balloonist.\"\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,\" he explained.\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I know.\"\n\"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\nthat I couldn't come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\naway. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a\nstrange and beautiful country.\n\"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\n\"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\"\n\"But isn't everything here green?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No more than in any other city,\" replied Oz; \"but when you wear green\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\nthat is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and\nthey like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself\nup and would not see any of them.\n\"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do\nwonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they\nruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.\nFortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew\nthey would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were\nterribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they\nthemselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in\ndeadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I\nwas when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.\nWhen you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would\nonly do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I\nam ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.\"\n\"I think you are a very bad man,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man, but I'm a very bad\nWizard, I must admit.\"\n\"Can't you give me brains?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"You don't need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has\nbrains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing that\nbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience\nyou are sure to get.\"\n\"That may all be true,\" said the Scarecrow, \"but I shall be very\nunhappy unless you give me brains.\"\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\n\"Well,\" he said with a sigh, \"I'm not much of a magician, as I said;\nbut if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head\nwith brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find\nthat out for yourself.\"\n\"Oh, thank you\u2014thank you!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"I'll find a way to use\nthem, never fear!\"\n\"But how about my courage?\" asked the Lion anxiously.\n\"You have plenty of courage, I am sure,\" answered Oz. \"All you need is\nconfidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid\nwhen it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are\nafraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.\"\n\"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same,\" said the Lion. \"I shall\nreally be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that\nmakes one forget he is afraid.\"\n\"Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,\" replied Oz.\n\"How about my heart?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"Why, as for that,\" answered Oz, \"I think you are wrong to want a\nheart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in\nluck not to have a heart.\"\n\"That must be a matter of opinion,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"For my part,\nI will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me\nthe heart.\"\n\"Very well,\" answered Oz meekly. \"Come to me tomorrow and you shall\nhave a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well\ncontinue the part a little longer.\"\n\"And now,\" said Dorothy, \"how am I to get back to Kansas?\"\n\"We shall have to think about that,\" replied the little man. \"Give me\ntwo or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a way to\ncarry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as\nmy guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon\nyou and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in\nreturn for my help\u2014such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no\none I am a humbug.\"\nThey agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to\ntheir rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that \"The Great and\nTerrible Humbug,\" as she called him, would find a way to send her back",

But the first thing to do is to cross the\ndesert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.\"\n\"How can I cross the desert?\" she inquired.\n\"Well, I'll tell you what I think,\" said the little man. \"You see, when\nI came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the\nair, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get\nacross the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my\npowers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over, and I\nbelieve I can make a balloon.\"\n\"How?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"A balloon,\" said Oz, \"is made of silk, which is coated with glue to\nkeep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be\nno trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas\nto fill the balloon with, to make it float.\"\n\"If it won't float,\" remarked Dorothy, \"it will be of no use to us.\"\n\"True,\" answered Oz. \"But there is another way to make it float, which\nis to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn't as good as gas, for if the\nair should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we\nshould be lost.\"\n\"We!\" exclaimed the girl. \"Are you going with me?\"\n\"Yes, of course,\" replied Oz. \"I am tired of being such a humbug. If I\nshould go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a\nWizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.\nSo I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.\nI'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.\"\n\"I shall be glad to have your company,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Thank you,\" he answered. \"Now, if you will help me sew the silk\ntogether, we will begin to work on our balloon.\"",

            "text": "\"Well, then, what can be done?\" inquired the Woodman.\nThe Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins\nand needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:\n\"Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the\ndesert?\"\n\"I never thought of that!\" said Dorothy joyfully. \"It's just the thing.\nI'll go at once for the Golden Cap.\"\nWhen she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and\nsoon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and\nstood beside her.\n\"This is the second time you have called us,\" said the Monkey King,\nbowing before the little girl. \"What do you wish?\"\n\"I want you to fly with me to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\nBut the Monkey King shook his head.\n\"That cannot be done,\" he said. \"We belong to this country alone, and\ncannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,\nand I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there. We\nshall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross\nthe desert. Good-bye.\"\nAnd with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away\nthrough the window, followed by all his band.\nDorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. \"I have wasted the charm\nof the Golden Cap to no purpose,\" she said, \"for the Winged Monkeys\ncannot help me.\"\n\"It is certainly too bad!\" said the tender-hearted Woodman.\nThe Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly\nthat Dorothy feared it would burst.\n\"Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,\" he said, \"and ask\nhis advice.\"\nSo the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for\nwhile Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.\n\"This little girl,\" said the Scarecrow to the soldier, \"wishes to cross\nthe desert. How can she do so?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" answered the soldier, \"for nobody has ever crossed the\ndesert, unless it is Oz himself.\"\n\"Is there no one who can help me?\" asked Dorothy earnestly.\n\"Glinda might,\" he suggested.\n\"Who is Glinda?\" inquired the Scarecrow.\n\"The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,\nand rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of\nthe desert, so she may know a way to cross it.\"\n\"Glinda is a Good Witch, isn't she?\" asked the child.\n\"The Quadlings think she is good,\" said the soldier, \"and she is kind\nto everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows\nhow to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.\"\n\"How can I get to her castle?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"The road is straight to the South,\" he answered, \"but it is said to be\nfull of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a\nrace of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For\nthis reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.\"\nThe soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:\n\"It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is\nto travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of\ncourse, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.\"\n\"You must have been thinking again,\" remarked the Tin Woodman.\n\"I have,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"I shall go with Dorothy,\" declared the Lion, \"for I am tired of your\ncity and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild\nbeast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.\"\n\"That is true,\" agreed the Woodman. \"My axe may be of service to her;\nso I also will go with her to the Land of the South.\"\n\"When shall we start?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"Are you going?\" they asked, in surprise.\n\"Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never have had brains.\nShe lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\nEmerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never\nleave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said Dorothy gratefully. \"You are all very kind to me. But\nI should like to start as soon as possible.\"\n\"We shall go tomorrow morning,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"So now let us\nall get ready, for it will be a long journey.\"",

So they looked\nfor the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with\nsuch wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass\nunderneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under\nthe first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next\nminute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his\nfellow travelers.\nThis did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked\nrather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.\n\"Here is another space between the trees,\" called the Lion.\n\"Let me try it first,\" said the Scarecrow, \"for it doesn't hurt me to\nget thrown about.\" He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its\nbranches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.\n\"This is strange,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"What shall we do?\"\n\"The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our\njourney,\" remarked the Lion.\n\"I believe I will try it myself,\" said the Woodman, and shouldering his\naxe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so\nroughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped\nat it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking\nall its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under\nit.\n\"Come on!\" he shouted to the others. \"Be quick!\" They all ran forward\nand passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught\nby a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly\nchopped off the branch and set the little dog free.\nThe other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they\nmade up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down\ntheir branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the\nforest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out\nof it.\nThe four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came\nto the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found\nbefore them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was\nsmooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"I will make a ladder,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"for we certainly must\nclimb over the wall.\"",

It looked clumsy, but the Tin\nWoodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The\nScarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the\nladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was\nso awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from\nfalling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the\nScarecrow said, \"Oh, my!\"\n\"Go on,\" exclaimed Dorothy.\nSo the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the\nwall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, \"Oh, my!\" just as the\nScarecrow had done.\nThen Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him\nbe still.\nThe Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but\nboth of them cried, \"Oh, my!\" as soon as they looked over the wall.\nWhen they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked\ndown and saw a strange sight.\nBefore them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and\nshining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were\nmany houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.\nThese houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as\nhigh as Dorothy's waist. There were also pretty little barns, with\nchina fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs\nand chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.\nBut the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer\ncountry. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored\nbodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most\ngorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in\nknee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and\ngolden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon\ntheir heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns\nin ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,\npointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of\nchina, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of\nthem was no higher than Dorothy's knee.\nNo one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little\npurple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and\nbarked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.\n\"How shall we get down?\" asked Dorothy.\nThey found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the\nScarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that",

When all were\nsafely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite\nflattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.\n\"We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,\"\nsaid Dorothy, \"for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except\ndue South.\"\nThey began walking through the country of the china people, and the\nfirst thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As\nthey drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,\nthe pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china\nground with a great clatter.\nDorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and\nthat the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor\nmilkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.\n\"There!\" cried the milkmaid angrily. \"See what you have done! My cow\nhas broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender's shop and have\nit glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my\ncow?\"\n\"I'm very sorry,\" returned Dorothy. \"Please forgive us.\"\nBut the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She\npicked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping\non three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful\nglances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked\nelbow close to her side.\nDorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.\n\"We must be very careful here,\" said the kind-hearted Woodman, \"or we\nmay hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.\"\nA little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young\nPrincess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run\naway.\nDorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But\nthe china girl cried out:\n\"Don't chase me! Don't chase me!\"\nShe had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Because,\" answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,\n\"if I run I may fall down and break myself.\"\n\"But could you not be mended?\" asked the girl.\n\"Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,\"\nreplied the Princess.\n\"I suppose not,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,\" continued the china lady,\n\"who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so\noften that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn't look at all\npretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.\"\nIndeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy\ncould see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and\ngreen he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way\nand showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.\nThe Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his\ncheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:\n\"My lady fair,\nWhy do you stare\nAt poor old Mr. Joker?\nYou're quite as stiff\nAnd prim as if\nYou'd eaten up a poker!\"\n\"Be quiet, sir!\" said the Princess. \"Can't you see these are strangers,\nand should be treated with respect?\"\n\"Well, that's respect, I expect,\" declared the Clown, and immediately\nstood upon his head.\n\"Don't mind Mr. Joker,\" said the Princess to Dorothy. \"He is\nconsiderably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.\"\n\"Oh, I don't mind him a bit,\" said Dorothy. \"But you are so beautiful,\"\nshe continued, \"that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won't you let\nme carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em's mantel? I could\ncarry you in my basket.\"\n\"That would make me very unhappy,\" answered the china Princess. \"You\nsee, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move\naround as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints\nat once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of\ncourse that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and\ncabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter\nhere in our own country.\"\n\"I would not make you unhappy for all the world!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\n\"So I'll just say good-bye.\"\n\"Good-bye,\" replied the Princess.\nThey walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and\nall the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would\nbreak them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other\nside of the country and came to another china wall.",

All you have to do is to knock the heels together\nthree times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to\ngo.\"\n\"If that is so,\" said the child joyfully, \"I will ask them to carry me\nback to Kansas at once.\"\nShe threw her arms around the Lion's neck and kissed him, patting his\nbig head tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in\na way most dangerous to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed\nbody of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face,\nand found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her\nloving comrades.\nGlinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little\ngirl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she\nhad shown to her friends and herself.",
