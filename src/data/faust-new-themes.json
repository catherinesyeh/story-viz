O, then,\nWhat precious stuff they dish, and call't a book,\nYour stomach turns at the first look;\nA heap of rubbish, and a lumber room,\nAt best some great state farce with proclamations,\nPragmatic maxims, protocols, orations,\nSuch as from puppet-mouths do fitly come!\nWagner.\nBut then the world!--the human heart and mind!\nSomewhat of this to know are all inclined.\nFaust.\nYes! as such knowledge goes! but what man dares\nTo call the child by the true name it bears?\nThe noble few that something better knew,\nAnd to the gross reach of the general view,\nTheir finer feelings bared, and insight true,\nFrom oldest times were burnt and crucified.\nI do beseech thee, friend--'tis getting late,\n'Twere wise to put an end to our debate.\nWagner.\nSuch learned talk to draw through all the night\nWith Doctor Faust were my supreme delight;\nBut on the morrow, being Easter, I\nYour patience with some questions more may try.\nWith zeal I've followed Learning's lofty call,\nMuch I have learned, but fain would master all.

cheat not the moment of its right\nBy curious care and envious repining;\nBehold how fair, in evening's mellow light,\nThe green-embosomed cottages are shining.\nThe sun slants down, the day hath lived his date,\nBut on he hies to tend another sphere.\nO that no wing upon my wish may wait\nTo follow still and still in his career!\nUpborne on evening's quenchless beams to greet\nThe noiseless world illumined at my feet,\nEach peaceful vale, each crimson-flaming peak,\nEach silver rill whose tinkling waters seek\nThe golden flood that feeds the fruitful plain.\nThen savage crags, and gorges dark, would rein\nMy proud careering course in vain;\nEv'n now the sea spreads out its shimmering bays,\nAnd charms the sense with ectasy of gaze.\nYet seems the god at length to sink;\nBut, borne by this new impulse of my mind,\nI hasten on, his quenchless ray to drink,\nThe day before me, and the night behind,\nThe heavens above me, under me the sea.\nA lovely dream! meanwhile the god is gone.\nAlas! the soul, in wing\u00e8d fancy free,\nSeeks for a corporal wing, and findeth none.\nYet in each breast 'tis deeply graven,\nUpward and onward still to pant,\nWhen over us, lost in the blue of heaven,\nHer quavering song the lark doth chaunt;\nWhen over piny peaks sublime\nThe eagle soars with easy strain,\nAnd over lands and seas the crane\nSteers homeward to a sunnier clime.\nWagner.\nI too have had my hours of whim,\nBut feeling here runs over reason's brim.\nForest and field soon tire the eye to scan,\nAnd eagle's wings were never made for man.\nHow otherwise the mind and its delights!\nFrom book to book, from page to page, we go.\nThus sweeten we the dreary winter nights,\nTill every limb with new life is aglow;\nAnd chance we but unroll some rare old parchment scroll,\nAll heaven stoops down, and finds a lodgment in the soul.\nFaust.\nThou know'st but the one impulse--it is well!\nTempt not the yearning that divides the heart.\nTwo souls, alas! within my bosom dwell!\nThis strives from that with adverse strain to part.\nThe one, bound fast by stubborn might of love,\nTo this low earth with grappling organs clings;\nThe other spurns the clod, and soars on wings\nTo join a nobler ancestry above.\nOh! be there spirits in the air,\n'Twixt earth and heaven that float with potent sway,\nDrop from your sphere of golden-glowing day,\nAnd waft me hence new varied life to share!\nMight I but own a mantle's fold enchanted,\nTo climes remote to bear me on its wing,\nMore than the costliest raiment I should vaunt it,\nMore than the purple robe that clothes a king.\nWagner.\nInvoke not rash the well-known spirit-throng,\nThat stream unseen the atmosphere along,\nAnd dangers thousandfold prepare,\nWeak men from every quarter to ensnare.\nFrom the keen north in troops they float,\nWith sharpest teeth and arrow-pointed tongues;\nFrom the harsh east they bring a blasting drought,\nAnd feed with wasting greed upon thy lungs.\nWhen from the arid south their sultry powers\nThey send, hot fires upheaping on thy crown,\nThe West brings forth his swarms with cooling showers,\nTo end in floods that sweep thy harvests down.\nQuick-ear'd are they, on wanton mischief bent,\nAnd work our will with surer bait to ply us;\nThey show as fair as heaven's own couriers sent,\nAnd lisp like angels when they most belie us.\nBut let us hence! the air is chill,\nThe cold gray mists are creeping down the hill,\nNow is the time to seek the bright fireside.\nWhy standest thou with strange eyes opened wide?\nWhat twilight-spectre may thy fancy trouble?\nFaust.\nSee'st thou that swarthy dog sweeping through corn and stubble?\nWagner.\nI saw him long ago--not strange he seemed to me.\nFaust.\nLook at him well--what should the creature be?\nWagner.\nHe seems a poodle who employs his snout\nNow here, now there, to snuff his master out.\nFaust.\nDost thou not see how nigher still and nigher\nHis spiral circles round us wind?\nAnd, err I not, he leaves behind\nHis track a train of sparkling fire.\nWagner.\nA small black poodle is all I see;\nSurely some strange delusion blinds thee!\nFaust.\nMethinks soft magic circles winds he,\nAbout, about, a snare for thee and me.\nWagner.\nI see him only doubtful springing round,\nHaving two strangers for his master found.\nFaust.\nHe draws him closer--now he comes quite near!\nWagner.\nA dog, be sure, and not a ghost, is here.\nHe growls, and looks about in fear,\nAnd crouches down, and looks to you,\nAnd wags his tail--what any dog will do.\nFaust.\nCome hither, poodle!\nWagner.\n'Tis a drollish brute;\nWhen you stand still, then stands he mute,\nBut when you speak, he springs as he would speak to you;\nHe will bring back what you let fall,\nAnd fetch your stick out of the water.\nFaust.\nYou are quite right. There's no such matter.\nNo trace of ghost--a dog well trained, that's all!\nWagner.\nA well-trained dog may well engage\nThe favor of a man most sage;\nThis poodle well deserves your recognition;\nFew students learn so much from good tuition.\n[_Exeunt, going in through the gate of the city._\nScene IV.\n/Faust's/ _Study._\nFaust.

now I know thy worthy duties all!\nUnable to annihilate wholesale,\nThy mischief now thou workest by retail.\nMephistopheles.\nAnd even thus, my progress is but small.\nThis something, the big lumpish world, which stands\nOpposed to nothing, still ties my hands,\nAnd spite of all the ground that I seem winning,\nRemains as firm as in the beginning;\nWith storms and tempests, earthquakes and burnings,\nEarth still enjoys its evenings and mornings,\nAnd the accurs\u00e8d fry of brute and human clay,\nOn them my noblest skill seems worse than thrown away.\nHow many thousands have I not buried!\nYet still a new fresh blood is hurried\nThrough fresh young veins, that I must sheer despair.\nThe earth, the water, and the air,\nThe moist, the dry, the hot, the cold,\nA thousand germs of life unfold;\nAnd had I not of flame made reservation,\nI had no portion left in the creation.\nFaust.\nAnd thus thou seekest to oppose\nThe genial power, from which all life and motion flows,\nAgainst Existence' universal chain,\nClenching thy icy devil's fist in vain!\nTry some more profitable feats,\nStrange son of Chaos, full of cross conceits.\nMephistopheles.\nThe hint is good, and on occasion,\nMay well deserve consideration;\nMeanwhile, with your good leave, I would withdraw.\nFaust.\nMy leave! do I make devil's law?\nThe liberty, methinks, is all your own.\nI see you here to-day with pleasure,\nGo now, and come back at your leisure.\nHere is the door, there is the window, and\nA chimney, if you choose it, is at hand.\nMephistopheles.\nLet me speak plain!

then hell too has its laws and rights,\nThus might one profit by the powers of evil,\nAnd make an honest bargain with the devil.\nMephistopheles.\nThe devil, sir, makes no undue exaction,\nAnd pays what he has promised to a fraction;\nBut this affair requires consideration,\nWe'll leave it for some future conversation.\nFor this time, I beseech your grace,\nLet me be gone; I've work to do.\nFaust.\nStay but one minute, I've scarce seen your face.\nSpeak; you should know the newest of the new.\nMephistopheles.\nI'll answer thee at length some other day;\nAt present, I beseech thee, let me loose.\nFaust.\nI laid no trap to snare thee in the way,\nThyself didst thrust thy head into the noose;\nWhoso hath caught the devil, hold him fast!\nSuch lucky chance returns not soon again.\nMephistopheles.\nIf 'tis your pleasure so, I will remain,\nBut on condition that the time be passed\nIn worthy wise, and you consent to see\nSome cunning sleights of spirit-craft from me.\nFaust.\nThy fancy jumps with mine.

Here I have got a phial\nOf which myself at times make trial:\n'Tis now a pleasant mellow potion;\nYou shall not meet with a denial.\n[_Softly._] Yet if this worthy man drinks it without precaution,\nHis life can't stand an hour against its strong infection.\nMephistopheles.\nLeave that to me; he's under my protection,\nRipe for the draught; no harm will come to him.\n[_The_ /Witch/, _with strange gestures, draws a circle and places\nmany curious things within it; meanwhile the glasses begin to tinkle,\nand the kettle to sound and make music. She brings a large book, puts\nthe_ /Cat-Apes/ _into the circle, and makes them serve as a desk to\nlay the book on, and hold the torches. She motions to_ /Faust/ _to\ncome near._\nFaust. [_to_ /Mephistopheles/]\nNow say, what would she with this flummery?\nThese antic gestures, this wild bedlam-stuff,\nThis most insipid of all mummery,\nI know it well, I hate it well enough.\nMephistopheles.\nPshaw, nonsense! come, give up your sermonizing,\nAnd learn to understand what a good joke is!\nLike other quacks, she plays her hocus-pocus;\nIt gives the juice a virtue most surprising!\n[_He obliges_ /Faust/ _to enter the circle._\nThe Witch. [_declaiming from the book with great emphasis_]\nNow be exact!\nOf one make ten,\nThen two subtract,\nAnd add three then,\nThis makes thee rich.\nFour shalt thou bate,\nOf five and six,\nSo says the Witch,\nMake seven and eight,\nAnd all is done.\nAnd nine is one,\nAnd ten is none;\nHere take and spell, if you are able,\nThe Witches' multiplication table.\nFaust.\nThis is a jargon worse than Babel;\nSay, is she fevered? is she mad?\nMephistopheles.\nO never fear! the rest is quite as bad;\nI know the book, and oft have vexed my brains\nWith bootless labor on its rhymes and rules;\nA downright contradiction still remains,\nMysterious alike for wise men and for fools.\nMy friend, the art is old and new;\nAncient and modern schools agree\nWith three and one, and one and three\nPlain to perplex, and false inweave with true.\nSo they expound, discourse, dispute, debate;\nWhat man of sense would plague him with their prate?\nMen pin their faith to words, in sounds high sapience weening,\nThough words were surely made to have a meaning.\nThe Witch. [_Goes on reading from the book_]\nThe soul to know\nBeneath the show,\nAnd view it without blinking;\nThe simple mind\nThe craft will find,\nWithout the toil of thinking.\nFaust.\nWhat flood of nonsense now she's pouring o'er us?\nShe'll split my skull with her insensate chatter.\nI feel as if I heard the ceaseless clatter\nOf thirty thousand idiots in a chorus.\nMephistopheles.\nEnough, kind Sibyl; thanks for thy good will!\nNow bring your jug here, and the goblet fill\nWith this prime juice, till it be brimming o'er.\nMy friend here is a man of high degrees,\nAnd will digest the draught with ease.\nHe has swilled many a goodly glass before.\n[_The_ /Witch/, _with many ceremonies, pours the beverage into\na cup. While_ /Faust/ _brings it to his mouth a light flame arises._\nMephistopheles.\nCome, quaff it boldly, without thinking!\nThe draught will make thy heart to burn with love.\nArt with the Devil hand and glove,\nAnd from a fire-spurt would'st be shrinking?\n[_The_ /Witch/ _looses the circle._ /Faust/ _steps out._\nMephistopheles.\nCome quickly out; you must not rest.\nThe Witch.\nI hope the swig will wonders work on thee!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd you, if you have aught to beg of me,\nUpon Walpurgis' night make your request.\nThe Witch.\nHere is a song! at times sung, you will find\nIt hath a wondrous working on your mind.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]\nCome, yield thee now to my desire;\nBe meek for once, and own the bridle.\nYou must keep quiet, and let yourself perspire,\nThat through your inmost frame the potent juice may pierce.\nWhen we have time to spare, I will rehearse\nSome lessons on the art of being nobly idle;\nAnd soon thy heart with ecstasy shall know,\nHow Cupid 'gins to stir, and boundeth to and fro.\nFaust.

[_She weeps._]\nHe may be dead!--Ah me!--could I but know,\nBy a certificate, that 'tis really so!\n_Enter_ /Margaret/.\nMargaret.\nMartha!\nMartha.\nWhat wouldst thou, dear?\nMargaret.\nMy knees can scarcely bear me!--only hear!\nI found a second box to-day\nOf ebon-wood, just where the first one lay,\nBrimful of jewels passing rare,\nMuch finer than the others.\nMartha.\nHave a care\nYou keep this well masked from your mother--\n'Twould fare no better than the other.\nMargaret.\nOnly come near, and see! look here!\nMartha. [_decking her with the jewels_]\nThou art a lucky little dear!\nMargaret.\nAnd yet I dare not thus be seen\nIn church, or on the public green.\nMartha.\nJust come across when you've an hour to spare,\nAnd put the gauds on here with none to see!\nThen promenade awhile before the mirror there;\n'Twill be a joy alike to thee and me.\nThen on a Sunday, or a holiday,\nOur riches by degrees we can display.\nA necklace first, the drops then in your ear;\nYour mother sees it not; and should she hear,\n'Tis easy to invent some fair pretence or other.\nMargaret.\nBut whence the pretty caskets came? I fear\nThere's something in it not right altogether. [_Knocking._]\nGood God!--I hear a step--is it my mother?\nMartha. [_looking through the casement_]\n'Tis a strange gentleman. Come in!\n_Enter_ /Mephistopheles/.\nMephistopheles.\nI hope the ladies will not think me rude,\nThat uninvited thus I here intrude.\n[_Observing_ /Margaret/, _he draws back respectfully._]\nI have commands for Mistress Martha Schwerdtlein.\nMartha.\nFor me? what has the gentleman to say?\nMephistopheles. [_softly to her_]\nExcuse my freedom. I perceive that you\nHave visitors of rank to-day;\nFor this time I shall bid adieu,\nAnd after dinner do myself the pleasure\nTo wait upon you, when you're more at leisure.\nMartha. [_aloud_]\nThink, child! of all things in the world the last!\nMy Gretchen for a lady should have passed!\nMargaret.\nThe gentleman is far too good;\nI'm a poor girl--boast neither wealth nor blood.\nThis dress, these jewels, are not mine.\nMephistopheles.\n'Tis not the dress alone that I admire;\nShe has a mien, a gait, a look so fine,\nThat speak the lady more than costliest attire.\nMartha.\nAnd now your business, sir? I much desire--\nMephistopheles.\nWould God I had a better tale to tell!\nSmall thanks I should receive, I knew it well.\nYour husband's dead--his last fond words I bear.\nMartha.\nIs dead! the good fond soul! O woe!\nMy man is dead! flow, sorrow, flow!\nMargaret.\nBeseech thee, dearest Martha, don't despair.\nMephistopheles.\nNow hear my mournful story to the end.\nMargaret.\nI would not love a man on earth, to rend\nMe thus with grief, when he might hap to die.\nMephistopheles.\nJoy hath its sorrow, sorrow hath its joy;\nTwin sisters are they, as the proverb saith.\nMartha.\nNow let me hear the manner of his death.\nMephistopheles.\nWhere Padua's sacred turrets rise,\nAbove the grave of holy Antony,\nOn consecrated ground thy husband lies,\nAnd slumbers for eternity.\nMartha.\nNo further message? is this all?\nMephistopheles.\nYes! one request, and that not small.\nFor his soul's peace, your good man wanted\nThree hundred masses to be chanted.\nThis is the whole of my commission.\nMartha.\nWhat! not a jewel? not a coin?\nNo journeyman, however poor,\nHowever wild, could make such an omission,\nBut in the bottom of his pouch is sure\nTo keep some small memorial for his wife,\nAnd rather beg, and rather pine\nAway the remnant of his life--\nMephistopheles.\nMadam! for your hard case I greatly grieve,\nBut your good husband had no gold to leave.\nHis sins and follies he lamented sore--\nYes! and bewailed his own mishap much more.\nMargaret.\nAlas for all the miseries of mankind!\nHe shall not want my oft-repeated prayer.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Margaret/]\nThou, gentle heart, dost well deserve to find\nA husband worthy of a bride so fair.\nMargaret.\nAh no!--for that, it is too soon.\nMephistopheles.\nA lover, then, might in the meantime do.\n'Tis bounteous Heaven's choicest boon\nTo fondle in one's arms so sweet a thing as you.\nMargaret.\nSuch things are never done with us.\nMephistopheles.\nDone or not done!--it may be managed thus:--\nMartha.\nNow let me hear!\nMephistopheles.\nBy his death-bed I stood.\nIt was a little better than of dung,\nOf mouldy straw; there, as a Christian should,\nWith many a sin repented on his tongue,\nHe died.--\"Oh! how must I,\" he said,\n\"Myself detest so to throw up my trade,\nAnd my dear wife abandon so!\nIt kills me with the simple memory, oh!\nMight she but now forgive me, ere I die!\"\nMartha. [_weeping_]\nGood soul! I have forgiven him long ago.\nMephistopheles. [_continuing his interrupted narrative_]\nAnd yet was she, God knows, much more to blame than I.\nMartha.\nWhat! did he lie? on the grave's brink to lie!\nMephistopheles.\nHe fabled to the last, be sure,\nIf I am half a connoisseur.\n\"In sooth, I had no time to gape,\" he said,\n\"First to get children, then to get them bread,\nTo clothe them, and to put them to a trade,\nFrom toil and labor I had no release,\nAnd could not even eat my own thin slice in peace.\"\nMartha.\nCan it then be? has he forgotten quite\nMy fag and drudgery, by day and night?\nMephistopheles.\nNot quite! attend the sequel of my tale.\n\"When last we sailed from Malta\"--so he said,\n\"For wife and children fervently I prayed,\nAnd Heaven then blew a favorable gale.\nWe came across a Turkish ship that bore\nHome bullion to increase the Sultan's store,\nAnd soon, by valor's right, were masters\nOf all the Infidel piastres;\nThe precious spoil was shared among the crew,\nAnd I received the part that was my due.\"\nMartha.\nBut where and how?--has he then buried it?\nMephistopheles.\nWho knows where the four winds have hurried it!\nA lady took him under her protection\nAt Naples, as he wandered to and fro;\nShe left him many a mark of her affection,\nAs to his life's end he had cause to know.\nMartha.\nThe knave, to treat his helpless orphans so!\nTo all our misery and all our need,\nAmid his reckless life, he gave no heed!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd for that cause he's dead. If I were you,\nNow mark me well, I tell you what I'd do;\nI'd mourn him decently for one chaste year,\nThen look about me for another dear.\nMartha.\nAlas! God knows it would be hard to find\nAnother so completely to my mind.\nA better-hearted fool you never knew,\nA love of roving was his only vice;\nAnd foreign wine, and foreign women too,\nAnd the accurs\u00e8d gambling dice.\nMephistopheles.\nSuch marriage-articles were most convenient,\nHad he to you been only half so lenient.\nOn terms like these myself had no objection\nTo change with you the ring of conjugal affection.\nMartha.\nYou jest, mein Herr!\nMephistopheles. [_aside_]\nA serious jest for me!\nI'd better go; for, if I tarry here,\nShe'll take the devil at his word, I fear.\n[_To_ /Margaret/.] How stands it with your heart then?--is it free?\nMargaret.\nI scarce know what you mean.\nMephistopheles.\nSweet guileless heart!\nLadies, farewell!\nMargaret.\nFarewell!\nMartha.\nOne word before we part!\nI fain would have it solemnly averred,\nHow my dear husband died, and where he was interred.\nOrder was aye my special virtue; and\n'Tis right both where and when he died should stand\nIn the newspapers.\nMephistopheles.\nYes, when two attest,\nAs Scripture saith, the truth is manifest.\nI have a friend, who, at your requisition,\nBefore the judge will make a deposition.\nI'll bring him here.\nMartha.\nYes, bring him with you, do!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd we shall meet your fair young lady too?\n[_To_ /Margaret/.] A gallant youth!--has been abroad, and seen\nThe world--a perfect cavalier, I trow.\nMargaret.\n'Twould make me blush, should he bestow\nA single look on one so mean.\nMephistopheles.\nYou have no cause to be ashamed before\nThe proudest king that ever sceptre bore.\nMartha.\nThis evening, in the garden then, behind\nThe house, you'll find warm hearts and welcome kind!\nScene VIII.",

I do not grudge you quiet,\nYou need my aid, and you cannot deny it.\nThere is not much to lose, I trow,\nWith one so harsh, and gruff, and mad as thou.\nToil! moil! from morn to ev'n, so on it goes!\nAnd what one should, and what one should not do,\nOne cannot always read it on your nose.\nFaust.\nThis is the proper tone for you!\nAnnoy me first, and then my thanks are due.\nMephistopheles.\nPoor son of Earth! without my timed assistance,\nHow had you ever dragged on your existence?\nFrom freakish fancy's fevered effervescence,\nI have worked long ago your convalescence,\nAnd, but for me, you would have marched away,\nIn your best youth, from the blest light of day.\nWhat have you here, in caves and clefts, to do,\nLike an old owl, screeching to-whit, to-whoo?\nOr like a torpid toad, that sits alone\nSipping the oozing moss and dripping stone?\nA precious condition to be in!\nI see the Doctor sticks yet in your skin.\nFaust.\nCouldst thou but know what re-born vigor springs\nFrom this lone wandering in the wilderness,\nCouldst thou conceive what heavenly joy it brings,\nThen wert thou fiend enough to envy me my bliss.\nMephistopheles.\nA supermundane bliss!\nIn night and dew to lie upon the height,\nAnd clasp the heaven and earth in wild delight,\nTo swell up to the godhead's stature,\nAnd pierce with clear miraculous sight\nThe inmost pith of central Nature,\nTo carry in your breast with strange elation,\nThe ferment of the whole six days' creation,\nWith proud anticipation of--I know\nNot what--to glow in rapturous overflow,\nAnd melt into the universal mind,\nCasting the paltry son of earth behind;\nAnd then, the heaven-sprung intuition\n[_With a gesture._] To end--I shall not say in what--fruition.\nFaust.\nShame on thee!\nMephistopheles.\nYes! that's not quite to your mind.\nYou have a privilege to cry out shame,\nWhen things are mentioned by their proper name.\nBefore chaste ears one may not dare to spout\nWhat chastest hearts yet cannot do without.\nI do not envy you the pleasure\nOf palming lies upon yourself at leisure;\nBut long it cannot last, I warrant thee.\nYou are returned to your old whims, I see,\nAnd, at this rate, you soon will wear\nYour strength away, in madness and despair.\nOf this enough! thy love sits waiting thee,\nIn doubt and darkness, cabined and confined.\nBy day, by night, she has thee in her mind;\nI trow she loves thee in no common kind.\nThy raging passion 'gan to flow,\nLike a torrent in spring from melted snow;\nInto her heart thy tide gushed high,\nNow is thy shallow streamlet dry.\nInstead of standing here to overbrim\nWith fine ecstatic rapture to the trees,\nMethinks the mighty gentleman might please\nTo drop some words of fond regard, to ease\nThe sweet young chick who droops and pines for him.\nPoor thing, she is half dead of ennui,\nAnd at the window stands whole hours, to see\nThe clouds pass by the old town-wall along.\nWere I a little bird! so goes her song\nThe live-long day, and half the night to boot.\nSometimes she will be merry, mostly sad,\nNow, like a child, weeping her sorrows out,\nNow calm again to look at, never glad;\nAlways in love.\nFaust.\nThou snake! thou snake!\nMephistopheles. [_to himself_]\nSo be it! that my guile thy stubborn will may break!\nFaust.\nHence and begone, thou son of filth and fire!\nName not the lovely maid again!\nBring not that overmastering desire\nOnce more to tempt my poor bewildered brain!\nMephistopheles.\nWhat then? she deems that you are gone forever;\nAnd half and half methinks you are.\nFaust.\nNo! I am nigh, and were I ne'er so far,\nI could forget her, I could lose her never;\nI envy ev'n the body of the Lord,\nWhen on the sacred cake her lips she closes.\nMephistopheles.\nYes! to be honest, and confess my sins,\nI oft have envied thee the lovely twins\nThat have their fragrant pasture among roses.\nFaust.\nAvaunt, thou pimp!\nMephistopheles.\nRail you, and I will laugh;\nThe God who made the human stuff\nBoth male and female, if the book don't lie,\nHimself the noblest trade knew well enough,\nHow to carve out an opportunity.\nBut come, why peak and pine you here?\nI lead you to the chamber of your dear,\nNot to the gallows.\nFaust.\nAh! what were Heaven's supremest blessedness\nWithin her arms, upon her breast, to me!\nMust I not still be wrung with agony,\nThat I should plunge her into such distress?\nI, the poor fugitive! outlaw from my kind,\nWithout a friend, without a home,\nWith restless heart, and aimless mind,\nUnblest, unblessing, ever doomed to roam;\nWho, like a waterfall, from rock to rock came roaring,\nWith greedy rage into the caldron pouring;\nWhile she, a heedless infant, rears\nSidewards her hut upon the Alpine field,\nWith all her hopes, and all her fears,\nWithin this little world concealed.\nAnd I--the God-detested--not content\nTo seize the rocks, and in my headlong bent\nTo shatter them to dust, with ruthless tide\nHer little shielding on the mountain side\nBore down, and wrecked her life's sweet peace with mine.\nAnd such an offering, Hell, must it be thine?\nHelp, Devil, to cut short the hour of ill!\nWhat happen must, may happen when it will!\nMay her sad fate my crashing fall attend,\nAnd she with me be ruined in the end!\nMephistopheles.\nLo! how it boils again and blows\nLike furnace, wherefore no man knows.\nGo in, thou fool, and let her borrow\nFrom thee, sweet solace to her sorrow!\nWhen such a brainsick dreamer sees\nNo road, where he to walk may please,\nHe stands and stares like Balaam's ass,\nAs if a god did block the pass.\nA man's a man who does and dares!\nIn other points you're spiced not scantly with the devil;\nNothing more silly moves on earth's wide level,\nThan is a devil who despairs.\nScene IV.",

Gretchen! she's the girl,\nOf womanhood the perfect pearl!\"\nAnd all the braggarts were dumb as death.\nAnd now,--the devil's in the matter!\nIt is enough to make one clatter,\nLike a rat, along the walls!\nShall every boor, with gibe and jeer,\nTurn up his nose when I appear?\nAnd every pettiest word that falls\nMe, like a purseless debtor, torture?\nAnd though I bruised them in a mortar,\nI could not say that they were wrong.\nWhat comes apace?--what creeps along?\nA pair of them comes slinking by.\nIf 'tis the man I look for, I\nWill dust his coat so well he'll not,\nBy Jove! go living from the spot!

I saw some trinkets for the girls,--\nA sort of necklace strung with pearls.\nFaust.\n'Tis well that we have this to give her,\nFor empty-handed go I never.\nMephistopheles.\nAnd yet a wise man ought to learn\nTo enjoy gratis, as well as to earn.\nNow, that the stars are bright and clear the sky,\nI'll give you a touch of choicest melody;\nA moral song--that, while we seem to school her,\nWith the more certainty we may befool her.\n[_Sings to the guitar._]\nWhy stands before\nHer lover's door,\nYoung Catherine here,\nAt early break of day?\nBeware, beware!\nHe lets thee in,\nA maiden in,\nA maiden not away!\nWhen full it blows,\nHe breaks the rose,\nAnd leaves thee then,\nA wretched outcast thing!\nTake warning, then,\nAnd yield to none\nBut who hath shown,\nAnd changed with thee the ring.\nValentin.

[_dancing with the young Witch_]\nA lovely dream once came to me,\nI saw in my sleep an apple-tree;\nTwo lovely apples on it did shine;\nI clomb the pole to make them mine.\nThe Young Witch.\nFor apples your sire in Paradise\nAnd primal dame had longing eyes:\nAnd, if your eyes are wise to see,\nYou'll find such apples on my tree.\nMephistopheles. [_dancing with the old Witch_]\nAn ugly dream once came to me,\nI dreamed I saw a cloven tree;\nIn the tree there sat an ugly owl;\nI called it fair, though it was foul.\nThe Old Witch.\nMy best salute this night shall be,\nThou knight of the cloven foot, to thee;\nA cloven tree with an ugly owl,\nAnd I for thee, or fair, or foul.\nProctophantasmist.[*n14] [_to the dancers_]\nListen to order, you presumptuous brood!\nHave we not proved beyond disputing,\nThat ghosts on terra firma have no footing?\nAnd yet you dance like any flesh and blood?\nThe Young Witch. [_dancing_]\nWhat wants he here, that rude-like fellow there?\nFaust. [_dancing_]\nO, he is everywhere!\nWhat others dance 'tis his to prize;\nEach step he cannot criticise\nHad as well not been made. But in the dance\nIt grieves him most when we advance.\nIf we would wheel still round and round in a ring,\nAs he is fond to do in his old mill,\nHe would not take it half so ill;\nEspecially if you take care to bring\nYour praiseful offering to his master skill.\nProctophantasmist.\nWhat! still there, phantoms? this is past endurance!\nIn this enlightened age you have the assurance\nTo show your face and play your tricks undaunted;\nWe are so wise, and yet a man's own house is haunted.\nHow long have I not swept the cobwebs of delusion,\nAnd still the world remains in the same wild confusion!\nThe Young Witch.\nBe quiet then, and seek some other place!\nProctophantasmist.\nI tell you, Spirits, in your face,\nThis intellectual thrall I cannot bear it;\nI love to have a free unshackled spirit. [_The dance goes on._]\nTo-day I see that all my strength is spent in vain;\nI've had a tour, at least, to compensate my evils,\nAnd hope, before I come to Blocksberg back again,\nTo crush, with one good stroke, the poets and the devils.\nMephistopheles.\nHe will now go, and, bare of breeches,\nSit in a pool with solemn patience;\nAnd, when his buttocks are well sucked by leeches,\nBe cured of ghosts and ghostly inspirations.\n[_To_ /Faust/, _who has just left the dance._]\nWhy do you let the lovely damsel go,\nThat in the dance with sweet song pleased you so?\nFaust.\nAlas! while she so passing sweet was singing,\nI saw a red mouse from her mouth outspringing.\nMephistopheles.\nPooh! on the Brocken that's a thing of course;\nLet not such trifles mar your sweet discourse.\nGo, join the crew, and dance away;\nEnough, the red mouse was not gray.\nFaust.\nThen saw I--\nMephistopheles.\nWhat?\nFaust.\nMephisto, see'st thou there\nA pale yet lovely girl, in lonely distance fare?\nFrom place to place she moveth slow;\nWith shackled feet she seems to go;\nI must confess, she has a cast\nOf Margaret, when I saw her last.\nMephistopheles.\nLet that alone! it brings thee certain harm;\nIt is bewitched, a bloodless, breathless form,\nFor men to look upon it is not good.\nIts fix\u00e8d gaze hath power to freeze the blood,\nAnd petrify thee stark and stiff.\nOf course I need not ask you if\nYou've heard of the Medusa's head.\nFaust.\nIn truth I see the eyes of one that's dead,\nOn which no closing hand of love was laid.\nThat is my Margaret's kindly breast,\nThat the sweet body I caressed.\nMephistopheles.\nThere lies the witchcraft o't, thou fool!\nA phantom takes thy wit to school:\nShe is the love of every lover's brain.\nFaust.\nWhat ecstasy! and yet what pain!\nI cannot leave it for my life.\nHow strangely this most lovely neck\nA single streak of red doth deck,\nNo broader than the back o' a knife!\nMephistopheles.\nQuite right! I see it, just as well as you.\nSometimes her head beneath her elbow too\nShe wears; for Perseus cut it off, you know.\nWhat! will you still a-dreaming go?\nCome, let us mount the hillock--there\nWe shall have noble sport, believe me;\nFor, unless mine eyes deceive me,\nThey have got up a theatre.\nWhat make you here?\nA Servant.\nYou are just come in time.\n'Tis a new piece, the last of all the seven,\nFor such the number that with us is given.\nA dilettante 'twas that wrote the rhyme,\nAnd dilettanti are the actors too.\nExcuse me, sirs,--no disrespect to you,\nIf I seem curt: I am the dilettante\nTo draw the curtain; and our time is scanty.\nMephistopheles.\nJust so; I only wish you were so clever\nTo know your home;\nThen from the Blocksberg you would never\nHave lust to roam!\nScene II.",

Singing heard from within._\nMy mother, the wanton,\nThat choked my breath![*n16]\nMy father, the villain,\nThat dined on my death!\nMy sister dear,\nIn the cool green shade\nMy bones she laid;\nThen was I a glad little bird in the May;\nFly away! fly away!\nFaust. [_opening the door_]\nShe dreams not that her loved one is so near,\nThe clinking chains and rustling straw to hear.\nMargaret. [_hiding herself on the bed_]\nWoe, woe! they come.--To bitter death they call.\nFaust. [_softly_]\nHush! hush! I come to free thee from their thrall!\nMargaret. [_throwing herself at his feet_]\nArt thou a man? feel for my hapless plight.\nFaust.\nThy cries will wake the watchers of the night!\n[_He takes hold of the chains to unloose them._\nMargaret. [_on her knees_]\nWho gave thee, hangman, such a power\nTo drag me from my cell at midnight hour?\nHave pity on me! Be not so harsh!--so rough!\nSurely to-morrow morn is soon enough. [_She stands up._]\nSo young, so very young, am I,\nAnd must already die!\nOnce I was lovely too--'twas this that caused my fall.\nNear was the friend, but far from me to-day;\nTorn lies the wreath, the flowers are scattered all.\nOh tear me not so forcibly away!\nSpare me! what have I done to injure thee?\nOh hear my prayer! for once compassion show!--\n'Tis the first time I ever looked on thee.\nFaust.\nThat I should live to see such depth of woe!\nMargaret.\nThou hast me now completely in thy might.\nOnly first give me time to suckle my sweet child.\nI hugged it the whole weary night;\nThey took't from me in very spite;\nAnd now they say I murdered the sweet child,\nAnd never more shall I be glad again.\nThey sing songs on me, too!\nA wicked thing to do!\n'Tis the refrain\nOf a grim old melody:\nWho taught them that its words were meant for me?\nFaust. [_throwing himself down_]\nHere, at thy feet, behold who loves thee fall,\nTo strike thy shackles, and to break thy thrall!\nMargaret. [_falling beside him on her knees_]\nYes! let us kneel and call upon the Saints!\nBeneath these steps,\nI hear it well!\nBeneath the threshold,\nBoileth Hell!\nThe evil One\nHis fury vents,\nWith fearful yell!\nFaust. [_loud_]\nGretchen! Gretchen!\nMargaret. [_attentive_]\nThat was the loved one's voice!\n[_She springs up; the chains fall away._]\nWhere is he? where? I heard him call on me,\nNow I am free! and none shall hinder me!\nTo his neck will I fly!\nOn his bosom lie!\nHe called me his Gretchen! he stood at the door.\nThrough the wild howling and hissing of Hell,\nThrough the loud-laughing scorn and the fiendish uproar,\nCame the sweet voice of love that I know so well.\nFaust.\n'Tis I!\nMargaret.\n'Tis thou! O say it yet again! [_Clasping him._]\n'Tis he! 'tis he! Where now is all my pain?\nWhere all my prison's woe? my fetters where?\n'Tis he! he comes to lift me from this lair\nOf wretchedness! I'm free, I'm free!\nAlready the well-known street I see,\nWhere the first time I spake to thee,\nAnd the pleasant garden, where\nMartha and I did wait for thee.\nFaust. [_striving forward_]\nCome, come!\nMargaret.\nO stay, stay!\nThou know'st how pleased I stay where thou dost stay.\n[_Caressing him._\nFaust.\nAway, away!\nUnless we haste,\nDearly we'll pay for these few moments' waste.\nMargaret.\nHow! giv'st thou me no kiss?\nMy friend, so very short a space away,\nAnd hast forgot to kiss?\nWhy feel I now so straitened when I hold\nThee in my arms? It was not so of old,\nWhen from thy words and looks, a heaven of bliss\nCame down; and thou didst kiss\nAs thou would'st smother me. Come, kiss me! kiss!\nElse kiss I thee! [_She embraces him._]\nO woe! thy lips are cold,\nAre dumb;\nWhere is the love thy swelling bosom bore\nWhilome for me? why are thy lips so cold?\n[_She turns away from him._\nFaust.\nCome with me, sweet love, come!\nI'll hug thee ten times closer than before,\nOnly come with me now! Come, I implore!\nMargaret. [_turning to him_]\nArt thou then _he_? Art thou then truly _he_?\nFaust.\n'Tis I, in truth. Come, love, and follow me.\nMargaret.\nAnd these vile chains thou breakest,\nAnd me again unto thy bosom takest?\nHow canst thou dare to turn fond eyes on me?\nKnow'st thou then, Henry, whom thou com'st to free?\nFaust.\nCome, come! the night sinks fast; come, follow me!\nMargaret.\nMy mother slept a sleep profound!\nI drugged her to't;\nMy little babe I drowned!\nWas it not heaven's boon to me and thee?\nThee, too!--'tis thou! I scarce may deem\nMy sense speaks true. Give me thy hand!\nIt is no dream!\nThy dear, dear hand!\nAlas! but it is wet!\nWipe it; for it is wet\nWith blood! O God! what hast thou done?\nPut up thy sword;\nI pray thee put it up.\nFaust.\nLet gone be gone!\nThou stabbest me with daggers, every word.\nMargaret.\nNo! thou shalt survive our sorrow!\nI will describe the graves to thee,\nWhere thou shalt bury them and me\nTo-morrow.\nThe best place thou shalt give my mother;\nClose beside her lay my brother;\nMe a little to the side,\nBut at distance not too wide!\nAnd my child at my right breast.--\nThese, and none else with us shall rest!\nMe on thy loving side to press,\nThat was a heaven of blessedness!\nBut now, I cannot do it more;\nI feel as I must force my love to thee,\nAnd thou didst coldly fling me back from thee;\nAnd yet 'tis thou!--as good, as loving as before.\nFaust.\n'Tis I, even I, come, sweet love, come!\nMargaret.\nOut there?\nFaust.\nInto the open air.\nMargaret.\nIf the grave be there,\nAnd death there waits, then come!\nHence to my eternal home,\nNot a step more.--\nThou leav'st me now?--would I might go with thee?\nFaust.\nThou canst, if thou but wilt. I have unbarred the door.\nMargaret.\nI may not go; no hope for me remains;\nThey watch me close--my home is with my chains.\nIt is so sad to beg from door to door;\nA guilty thing from human loves outcast,\nA homeless earth to wander o'er;\nAnd they are sure to find me out at last.\nFaust.\nI will protect thee.\nMargaret.\nQuick! Quick!\nSave thy poor child!\nAway, away!\nKeep the path\nUp the stream,\nAcross the bridge,\nTo the left hand,\nWhere the plank stands,\nIn the pond,\nSeize it, quick!\nIt rises up,\nIt kicks! it lives!\nO save it, save it!\nFaust.\nOnly bethink thee!\nOne step more, and thou art free.\nMargaret.\nWould we were past that mountain gray!\nThere sits my mother on a stone--\nI feel a hand that pulls me back\nAs cold as clay!\nThere sits my mother on a stone;\nHer head sways heavily;\nShe winks not, she nods not, her head she may not raise.\nShe slept so long, she never more may wake.\nShe slept that we might our enjoyment take.\nO these were happy days!\nFaust.\nHere words and prayers will only make things worse;\nCome! come; or I must hale thee hence by force.\nMargaret.\nLet me alone! lay no rough hands on me!\nNor with such murderous clutches seize me!\nThou know'st I have done everything to please thee.\nFaust.\nThe day dawns. Come, my Gretchen, follow me!\nMargaret.\nDay! yes, it is day! the Judgment-day breaks in!\nMy marriage-day it should have been!\nLet no one know thou wert before with Margaret.\nWoe to my wreath!\n'Tis done! oh, pain!\nWe will meet again;\nBut not at the dance.\nThe thronging crowds advance\nWith bated breath;\nNo word is spoken;\nThe squares, the streets,\nCannot contain them all.\nThe bell doth call,\nThe staff is broken,\nThey bind me with cords, they drag me away,\nAnd on the bloody block me lay;\nAnd every trembling eye doth quake\nAt the blade that is brandished o'er my neck.\nMute lies the world as the grave!\nFaust.\nO had I ne'er been born!\nMephistopheles. [_appearing from without_]\nUp! or no help can save!\nProfitless whining, whimpering, and prating!\nMeanwhile my eager steeds are waiting,\nSnuffing the scent of the morning air.\nMargaret.\nWhat's that from the floor uprising there?\n'Tis he! 'Tis he! O send his hateful face\nAway! What seeks he in this holy place?\nHe comes for me!\nFaust.\nNo! thou shalt live.\nMargaret.\nJudgment of God! to thee my soul I give.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]\nCome, come! else will I leave you to your fate!\nMargaret.\nThine am I, Father! O shut not the gate\nOf mercy on me!\nYe angels! ye most holy Spirits! now\nEncamp around me! and protect me now!\nHenry, I tremble when I think on thee.\nMephistopheles.\nShe is judged!\nVoice.
