Still less were her former\ncompanions, the minor ladies of the Wardrobe, content to see her\nraised so far above them. Thus her position at Court, preponderant\nthough it was, exposed her to constant jealousy and ill will; and\nsoon, worn out with petty vexations, she fell into a decline, growing\nvery melancholy and retiring frequently to her home. But the Emperor,\nso far from wearying of her now that she was no longer well or gay,\ngrew every day more tender, and paid not the smallest heed to those\nwho reproved him, till his conduct became the talk of all the land;\nand even his own barons and courtiers began to look askance at an\nattachment so ill-advised. They whispered among themselves that in the\nLand Beyond the Sea such happenings had led to riot and disaster.\nThe people of the country did indeed soon have many grievances to\nshow: and some likened her to Yang Kuei-fei, the mistress of Ming\nHuang.[2] Yet, for all this discontent, so great was the sheltering\npower of her master's love that none dared openly molest her.",

But\nthis only made him long the more to see the dead lady's child, and he\nwas always sending trusted servants, such as his own old nurse, to\nreport to him upon the boy's progress. The time of the autumn equinox\nhad come. Already the touch of the evening air was cold upon the skin.\nSo many memories crowded upon him that he sent a girl, the daughter of\nhis quiver-bearer, with a letter to the dead lady's house. It was\nbeautiful moonlit weather, and after he had despatched the messenger\nhe lingered for a while gazing out into the night. It was at such\ntimes as this that he had been wont to call for music. He remembered\nhow her words, lightly whispered, had blended with those strangely\nfashioned harmonies, remembered how all was strange, her face, her\nair, her form. He thought of the poem which says that 'real things in\nthe darkness seem no realer than dreams' and he longed for even so dim\na substance as the dream-life of those nights.\nThe messenger had reached the gates of the house. She pushed them back\nand a strange sight met her eyes. The old lady had for long been a\nwidow and the whole charge of keeping the domain in repair had fallen\nupon her daughter. But since her death the mother, sunk in age and\ndespair, had done nothing to the place, and everywhere the weeds\ngrew high; and to all this desolation was added the wildness of the\nautumn gale. Great clumps of mugwort grew so thick that only the\nmoonlight could penetrate them. The messenger alighted at the entrance\nof the house. At first the mother could find no words with which to\ngreet her, but soon she said: 'Alas, I have lingered too long in the\nworld! I cannot bear to think that so fine a messenger as you have\npressed your way through the dewy thickets that bar the road to my\nhouse,' and she burst into uncontrollable weeping. Then the\nquiver-bearer's daughter said 'One of the Palace maids who came here,\ntold his Majesty that her heart had been torn with pity at what she\nsaw. And I, Madam, am in like case.' Then after a little hesitation\nshe repeated the Emperor's message: \"For a while I searched in the\ndarkness of my mind, groping for an exit from my dream; but after long\npondering I can find no way to wake. There is none here to counsel me.\nWill you not come to me secretly? It is not well that the young prince\nshould spend his days in so desolate and sad a place. Let him come\ntoo!\" This he said and much else, but confusedly and with many sighs;\nand I, seeing that the struggle to hide his grief from me was costing\nhim dear, hurried away from the Palace without hearing all. But here\nis a letter that he sent.'\n'My sight is dim' said the mother. 'Let me hold His letter to the\nlight.' The letter said:\n'I had thought that after a while there might be some blurring, some\nslight effacement. But no. As days and months go by, the more\nsenseless, the more unendurable becomes my life. I am continually\nthinking of the child, wondering how he fares. I had hoped that his\nmother and I together would watch over his upbringing. Will you not\ntake her place in this, and bring him to me as a memory of the\npast?' Such was the letter, and many instructions were added to it\ntogether with a poem which said '_At the sound of the wind that binds\nthe cold dew on Takagi moor, my heart goes out to the tender lilac\nstems_.'\nIt was of the young prince that he spoke in symbol; but she did not\nread the letter to the end. At last the mother said 'Though I know\nthat long life means only bitterness, I have stayed so long in the\nworld that even before the Pine Tree of Takasago I should hide my head\nin shame. How then should I find courage to go hither and thither in\nthe great Palace of a Hundred Towers? Though the august summons should\ncall me time and again, myself I could not obey. But the young prince\n(whether he may have heard the august wish I know not) is impatient to\nreturn, and, what is small wonder, seems very downcast in this place.\nTell his Majesty this, and whatever else of my thoughts you have here\nlearnt from me. For a little child this house is indeed a sorry\nplace....' 'They say that the child is asleep' the quiver-bearer's\ndaughter answered. 'I should like to have seen him and told the\nEmperor how he looks; but I am awaited at the Palace and it must be\nlate.'\nShe was hastening away, but the mother: 'Since even those who wander\nin the darkness of their own black thoughts can gain by converse a\nmomentary beam to guide their steps, I pray you sometimes to visit me\nof your own accord and when you are at leisure. In years past it was\nat times of joy and triumph that you came to this house, and now this\nis the news you bring! Foolish are they indeed who trust to fortune!\nFrom the time she was born until his death, her father, who knew his\nown mind, would have it that she must go to Court and charged me again\nand again not to disappoint his wishes if he were to die. And so,\nthough I thought that the lack of a guardian would bring her into\nmany difficulties, I was determined to carry out his desire. At Court\nshe found that favours only too great were to be hers, and all the\nwhile must needs endure in secrecy the tokens of inhuman malice; till\nhatred had heaped upon her so heavy a load of cares that she died as\nit were murdered. Indeed, the love that in His wisdom He deigned to\nshow her (or so sometimes it seems to me in the uncomprehending\ndarkness of my heart) was crueller than indifference.'\nSo she spoke, till tears would let her speak no more; and now the\nnight had come.\n'All this' the girl answered 'He himself has said; and further: \"That\nthus against My will and judgment I yielded helplessly to a passion so\nreckless that it caused men's eyes to blink was perhaps decreed for\nthe very reason that our time was fated to be so short; it was the\nwild and vehement passion of those who are marked down for instant\nseparation. And though I had vowed that none should suffer because of\nmy love, yet in the end she bore upon her shoulders the heavy hatred\nof many who thought that for her sake they had been wronged.\"\n'So again and again have I heard the Emperor speak with tears. But now\nthe night is far spent and I must carry my message to the Palace\nbefore day comes.'\nSo she, weeping too, spoke as she hurried away. But the sinking moon\nwas shining in a cloudless sky, and in the grass-clumps that shivered\nin the cold wind, bell-crickets tinkled their compelling cry. It was\nhard to leave these grass-clumps, and the quiver-bearer's daughter,\nloth to ride away, recited the poem which says 'Ceaseless as the\ninterminable voices of the bell-cricket, all night till dawn my tears\nflow.' The mother answered 'Upon the thickets that teem with myriad\ninsect voices falls the dew of a Cloud Dweller's tears'; for the\npeople of the Court are called _dwellers above the clouds_. Then\nshe gave the messenger a sash, a comb and other things that the dead\nlady had left in her keeping,\u2014gifts from the Emperor which now, since\ntheir use was gone, she sent back to him as mementoes of the past. The\nnurse-maids who had come with the boy were depressed not so much at\ntheir mistress's death as at being suddenly deprived of the daily\nsights and sensations of the Palace. They begged to go back at once.\nBut the mother was determined not to go herself, knowing that she\nwould cut too forlorn a figure. On the other hand if she parted with\nthe boy, she would be daily in great anxiety about him. That was why\nshe did not immediately either go with him herself or send him to the\nPalace.\nThe quiver-bearer's daughter found the Emperor still awake. He was,\nupon pretext of visiting the flower-pots in front of the Palace which\nwere then in full bloom, waiting for her out of doors, while four or\nfive trusted ladies conversed with him.\nAt this time it was his wont to examine morning and evening a picture\nof The Everlasting Wrong,[6] the text written by Teiji no In,[7] with\npoems by Ise[8] and Tsurayuki,[9] both in Yamato speech, and in that\nof the men beyond the sea, and the story of this poem was the common\nmatter of his talk.\nNow he turned to the messenger and asked eagerly for all her news. And\nwhen she had given him a secret and faithful account of the sad place\nwhence she had come, she handed him the mother's letter: 'His\nMajesty's gracious commands I read with reverence deeper than I can\nexpress, but their purport has brought great darkness and confusion\nto my mind.' All this, together with a poem in which she compared\nher grandchild to a flower which has lost the tree that sheltered it\nfrom the great winds, was so wild and so ill-writ as only to be\nsuffered from the hand of one whose sorrow was as yet unhealed.\nAgain the Emperor strove for self-possession in the presence of his\nmessenger. But as he pictured to himself the time when the dead lady\nfirst came to him, a thousand memories pressed thick about him, and\nrecollection linked to recollection carried him onward, till he\nshuddered to think how utterly unmarked, unheeded all these hours and\ndays had fled.\nAt last he said 'I too thought much and with delight how with most\nprofit might be fulfilled the wish that her father the Councillor left\nbehind him; but of that no more. If the young Prince lives occasion\nmay yet be found.... It is for his long life that we must pray.'\nHe looked at the presents she had brought back and 'Would that like\nthe wizard you had brought a kingfisher-hairpin as token of your visit\nto the place where her spirit dwells' he cried, and recited the poem:\n_Oh for a master of magic who might go and seek her, and by a message\nteach me where her spirit dwells_.\nFor the picture of Kuei-fei, skilful though the painter might be, was\nbut the work of a brush, and had no living fragrance. And though the\npoet tells us that Kuei-fei's grace was as that of 'the hibiscus of\nthe Royal Lake or the willows of the Wei-yang Palace,' the lady in the\npicture was all paint and powder and had a simpering Chinesified air.\nBut when he thought of the lost lady's voice and form, he could find\nneither in the beauty of flowers nor in the song of birds any fit\ncomparison. Continually he pined that fate should not have allowed\nthem to fulfil the vow which morning and evening was ever talked of\nbetween them,\u2014the vow that their lives should be as the twin birds\nthat share a wing, the twin trees that share a bough. The rustling of\nthe wind, the chirping of an insect would cast him into the deepest\nmelancholy; and now K\u014dkiden, who for a long while had not been\nadmitted to his chamber, must needs sit in the moonlight making music\nfar on into the night! This evidently distressed him in the highest\ndegree and those ladies and courtiers who were with him were equally\nshocked and distressed on his behalf. But the offending lady was one\nwho stood much upon her dignity and she was determined to behave as\nthough nothing of any consequence had taken place in the Palace.\nAnd now the moon had set. The Emperor thought of the girl's mother in\nthe house amid the thickets and wondered, making a poem of the\nthought, with what feelings she had watched the sinking of the autumn\nmoon: 'for even we Men above the Clouds were weeping when it sank.'\nHe raised the torches high in their sockets and still sat up. But at\nlast he heard voices coming from the Watch House of the Right and knew\nthat the hour of the Bull[10] had struck. Then, lest he should be\nseen, he went into his chamber. He found he could not sleep and was up\nbefore daybreak. But, as though he remembered the words 'he knew not\nthe dawn was at his window' of Ise's poem,[11] he showed little\nattention to the affairs of his Morning Audience, scarcely touched his\ndried rice and seemed but dimly aware of the viands on the great\nTable, so that the carvers and waiting-men groaned to see their\nMaster's plight; and all his servants, both men and women kept on\nwhispering to one another 'What a senseless occupation has ours\nbecome!' and supposed that he was obeying some extravagant vow.\nRegardless of his subjects' murmurings, he continually allowed his\nmind to wander from their affairs to his own, so that the scandal of\nhis negligence was now as dangerous to the State as it had been\nbefore, and again there began to be whispered references to a certain\nEmperor of another land. Thus the months and days passed, and in the\nend the young prince arrived at Court. He had grown up to be a child\nof unrivalled beauty and the Emperor was delighted with him. In the\nspring an heir to the Throne was to be proclaimed and the Emperor was\nsorely tempted to pass over the first-born prince in favour of the\nyoung child. But there was no one at Court to support such a choice\nand it was unlikely that it would be tolerated by the people; it would\nindeed bring danger rather than glory to the child. So he carefully\nconcealed from the world that he had any such design, and gained great\ncredit, men saying 'Though he dotes on the boy, there is at least some\nlimit to his folly.' And even the great ladies of the Palace became a\nlittle easier in their minds.\nThe grandmother remained inconsolable, and impatient to set out upon\nher search for the place where the dead lady's spirit dwelt, she soon\nexpired. Again the Emperor was in great distress; and this time the\nboy, being now six years old, understood what had happened and wept\nbitterly. And often he spoke sadly of what he had seen when he was\nbrought to visit the poor dead lady who had for many years been so\nkind to him. Henceforward he lived always at the Palace. When he\nbecame seven he began to learn his letters, and his quickness was so",

The little prince presented him with a very\nnice verse of poetry, at which he expressed boundless admiration and\noffered the boy a number of handsome presents. In return the Emperor\nsent him a large reward from the Imperial Treasury. This was all kept\nstrictly secret. But somehow or other the Heir Apparent's grandfather,\nthe Minister of the Right, and others of his party got wind of\nit and became very suspicious. The Emperor then sent for native\nfortune-tellers and made trial of them, explaining that because of\ncertain signs which he had himself observed he had hitherto refrained\nfrom making the boy a prince. With one accord they agreed that he had\nacted with great prudence and the Emperor determined not to set the\nchild adrift upon the world as a prince without royal standing or\ninfluence upon the mother's side. For he thought 'My own power is very\ninsecure. I had best set him to watch on my behalf over the great\nOfficers of State.' Thinking that he had thus agreeably settled the\nchild's future, he set seriously to work upon his education, and saw\nto it that he should be made perfect in every branch of art and\nknowledge. He showed such aptitude in all his studies that it seemed a\npity he should remain a commoner and as it had been decided that it\nwould arouse suspicion if he were made a prince, the Emperor consulted\nwith certain doctors wise in the lore of the planets and phases of the\nmoon. And they with one accord recommended that he should be made a\nMember of the Minamoto (or Gen) Clan. So this was done. As the years",

He was soon quite at his ease with\nthe common run of Ladies in Waiting and Ladies of the Wardrobe, so it\nwas not likely he would be shy with one who was daily summoned to the\nEmperor's apartments. It was but natural that all these ladies should\nvie eagerly with one another for the first place in Genji's\naffections, and there were many whom in various ways he admired very\nmuch. But most of them behaved in too grown-up a fashion; only one,\nthe new princess, was pretty and quite young as well, and though she\ntried to hide from him, it was inevitable that they should often meet.\nHe could not remember his mother, but the Dame of the Household had\ntold him how very like to her the girl was, and this interested his\nchildish fancy, and he would like to have been her great friend and\nlived with her always. One day the Emperor said to her 'Do not be\nunkind to him. He is interested because he has heard that you are so\nlike his mother. Do not think him impertinent, but behave nicely to\nhim. You are indeed so like him in look and features that you might\nwell be his mother.'\nAnd so, young though he was, fleeting beauty took its hold upon his\nthoughts; he felt his first clear predilection.\nK\u014dkiden had never loved this lady too well, and now her old enmity to\nGenji sprang up again; her own children were reckoned to be of quite\nuncommon beauty, but in this they were no match for Genji, who was so\nlovely a boy that people called him Hikaru Genji or Genji the\nShining One; and Princess Fujitsubo, who also had many admirers, was\ncalled Princess Glittering Sunshine.\nThough it seemed a shame to put so lovely a child into man's dress, he\nwas now twelve years old and the time for his Initiation was come. The\nEmperor directed the preparations with tireless zeal and insisted upon\na magnificence beyond what was prescribed. The Initiation of the Heir\nApparent, which had last year been celebrated in the Southern Hall,\nwas not a whit more splendid in its preparations. The ordering of the\nbanquets that were to be given in various quarters, and the work of\nthe Treasurer and Grain Intendant he supervised in person, fearing\nlest the officials should be remiss; and in the end all was\nperfection. The ceremony took place in the eastern wing of the\nEmperor's own apartments, and the Throne was placed facing towards the\neast, with the seats of the Initiate to-be and his Sponsor (the\nMinister of the Left) in front.\nGenji arrived at the hour of the Monkey.[13] He looked very handsome\nwith his long childish locks, and the Sponsor, whose duty it had just\nbeen to bind them with the purple filet, was sorry to think that all\nthis would soon be changed and even the Clerk of the Treasury seemed\nloath to sever those lovely tresses with the ritual knife. The\nEmperor, as he watched, remembered for a moment what pride the mother\nwould have taken in the ceremony, but soon drove the weak thought from\nhis mind.\nDuly crowned, Genji went to his chamber and changing into man's dress\nwent down into the courtyard and performed the Dance of Homage, which\nhe did with such grace that tears stood in every eye. And now the\nEmperor, whose grief had of late grown somewhat less insistent, was\nagain overwhelmed by memories of the past.\nIt had been feared that his delicate features would show to less\nadvantage when he had put aside his childish dress; but on the\ncontrary he looked handsomer than ever.\nHis sponsor, the Minister of the Left, had an only daughter whose\nbeauty the Heir Apparent had noticed. But now the father began to\nthink he would not encourage that match, but would offer her to Genji.\nHe sounded the Emperor upon this, and found that he would be very glad\nto obtain for the boy the advantage of so powerful a connection.\nWhen the courtiers assembled to drink the Love Cup, Genji came and\ntook his place among the other princes. The Minister of the Left came\nup and whispered something in his ear; but the boy blushed and could\nthink of no reply. A chamberlain now came over to the Minister and\nbrought him a summons to wait upon His Majesty immediately. When he\narrived before the Throne, a Lady of the Wardrobe handed to him the\nGreat White Inner Garment and the Maid's Skirt,[14] which were his\nritual due as Sponsor to the Prince. Then, when he had made him drink\nout of the Royal Cup, the Emperor recited a poem in which he prayed\nthat the binding of the purple filet might symbolize the union of\ntheir two houses; and the Minister answered him that nothing should\nsever this union save the fading of the purple band. Then he descended\nthe long stairs and from the courtyard performed the Grand\nObeisance.[15] Here too were shown the horses from the Royal Stables\nand the hawks from the Royal Falconry, that had been decreed as\npresents for Genji. At the foot of the stairs the Princes and\nCourtiers were lined up to receive their bounties, and gifts of every\nkind were showered upon them. That day the hampers and fruit baskets\nwere distributed in accordance with the Emperor's directions by the\nlearned Secretary of the Right, and boxes of cake and presents lay\nabout so thick that one could scarcely move. Such profusion had not\nbeen seen even at the Heir Apparent's Initiation.\nThat night Genji went to the Minister's house, where his betrothal was\ncelebrated with great splendour. It was thought that the little Prince\nlooked somewhat childish and delicate, but his beauty astonished\neveryone. Only the bride, who was four years older, regarded him as a",

He was sitting by the lamp, looking at\nvarious books and papers. Suddenly he began pulling some letters out\nof the drawers of a desk which stood near by. This aroused T\u014d no\nCh\u016bj\u014d's curiosity. 'Some of them I can show to you' said Genji, 'but\nthere are others which I had rather....' 'It is just those which I\nwant to see. Ordinary, commonplace letters are very much alike and I\ndo not suppose that yours differ much from mine. What I want to see\nare passionate letters written in moments of resentment, letters\nhinting consent, letters written at dusk....'\nHe begged so eagerly that Genji let him examine the drawers. It was\nnot indeed likely that he had put any very important or secret\ndocuments in the ordinary desk; he would have hidden them away much\nfurther from sight. So he felt sure that the letters in these drawers\nwould be nothing to worry about. After turning over a few of them,\n'What an astonishing variety!' T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d exclaimed and began\nguessing at the writers' names, and made one or two good hits. More\noften he was wrong and Genji, amused by his puzzled air, said very\nlittle but generally managed to lead him astray. At last he took the\nletters back, saying 'But you too must have a large collection. Show\nme some of yours, and my desk will open to you with better will.' 'I",

How are we to deal with such cases?'\nAt this moment they were joined by Hidari no Uma no Kami and T\u014d\nShikibu no J\u014d, who said they had also come to the Palace to keep the\nfast. As both of them were great lovers and good talkers, T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d\nhanded over to them the decision of Genji's question, and in the\ndiscussion which followed many unflattering things were said. Uma\nno Kami spoke first. 'However high a lady may rise, if she does not\ncome of an adequate stock, the world will think very differently of\nher from what it would of one born to such honours; but if through\nadverse fortune a lady of highest rank finds herself in friendless\nmisery, the noble breeding of her mind is soon forgotten and she\nbecomes an object of contempt. I think then that taking all things\ninto account, we must put such ladies too into the \"middle class.\" But\nwhen we come to classify the daughters of Zury\u014d,[4] who are sent to\nlabour at the affairs of distant provinces,\u2014they have such ups and\ndowns that we may reasonably put them too into the middle class.\n'Then there are Ministers of the third and fourth classes without\nCabinet rank. These are generally thought less of even than the\nhumdrum, ordinary officials. They are usually of quite good birth, but\nhave much less responsibility than Ministers of State and consequently\nmuch greater peace of mind. Girls born into such households are\nbrought up in complete security from want or deprivation of any kind,\nand indeed often amid surroundings of the utmost luxury and splendour.\nMany of them grow up into women whom it would be folly to despise;\nsome have been admitted at Court, where they have enjoyed a quite\nunexpected success. And of this I could cite many, many instances.'\n'Their success has generally been due to their having a lot of money,'\nsaid Genji smiling. 'You should have known better than to say that,'\nsaid T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d, reproving him, and Uma no Kami went on: 'There are\nsome whose lineage and reputation are so high that it never occurs to\none that their education could possibly be at fault; yet when we meet\nthem, we find ourselves exclaiming in despair \"How can they have\ncontrived to grow up like this?\"\n'No doubt the perfect woman in whom none of those essentials is\nlacking must somewhere exist and it would not startle me to find her.\nBut she would certainly be beyond the reach of a humble person like\nmyself, and for that reason I should like to put her in a category of\nher own and not to count her in our present classification.",

The complete surprise of it, the upsetting of\nall our wise theories and classifications, would be likely, I think,\nto lay a strange and sudden enchantment upon us. I imagine her father\nrather large and gruff; her brother, a surly, ill-looking fellow.\nLocked away in an utterly blank and uninteresting bed-room she will be\nsubject to odd flights of fancy, so that in her hands the arts that\nothers learn as trivial accomplishments will seem strangely full of\nmeaning and importance; or perhaps in some particular art she will\nthrill us by her delightful and unexpected mastery. Such a one may\nperhaps be beneath the attention of those of you who are of flawless\nlineage. But for my part I find it hard to banish her ...' and here he\nlooked at Shikibu no J\u014d, who wondered whether the description had been\nmeant to apply to his own sisters, but said nothing. 'If it is\ndifficult to choose even out of the top class ...' thought Genji, and\nbegan to doze.\nHe was dressed in a suit of soft white silk, with a rough cloak\ncarelessly slung over his shoulders, with belt and fastenings untied.\nIn the light of the lamp against which he was leaning he looked so\nlovely that one might have wished he were a girl; and they thought\nthat even Uma no Kami's 'perfect woman,' whom he had placed in a\ncategory of her own, would not be worthy of such a prince as Genji.\nThe conversation went on. Many persons and things were discussed. Uma\nno Kami contended that perfection is equally difficult to find in\nother spheres. The sovereign is hard put to it to choose his\nministers. But he at least has an easier task than the husband, for he\ndoes not entrust the affairs of his kingdom to one, two or three\npersons alone, but sets up a whole system of superiors and subordinates.\nBut when the mistress of a house is to be selected, a single\nindividual must be found who will combine in her person many diverse\nqualities. It will not do to be too exacting. Let us be sure that the\nlady of our choice possesses certain tangible qualities which we\nadmire; and if in other ways she falls short of our ideal, we must be\npatient and call to mind those qualities which first induced us to\nbegin our courting.\nBut even here we must beware; for there are some who in the\nselfishness of youth and flawless beauty are determined that not a\ndust-flick shall fall upon them. In their letters they choose the most\nharmless topics, but yet contrive to colour the very texture of the\nwritten signs with a tenderness that vaguely disquiets us. But such a\none, when we have at last secured a meeting, will speak so low that\nshe can scarcely be heard, and the few faint sentences that she\nmurmurs beneath her breath serve only to make her more mysterious than\nbefore. All this may seem to be the pretty shrinking of girlish\nmodesty; but we may later find that what held her back was the very\nviolence of her passions.\nOr again, where all seems plain sailing, the perfect companion will\nturn out to be too impressionable and will upon the most inappropriate\noccasions display her affections in so ludicrous a way that we begin\nto wish ourselves rid of her.\nThen there is the zealous house-wife, who regardless of her appearance\ntwists her hair behind her ears and devotes herself entirely to the\ndetails of our domestic welfare. The husband, in his comings and\ngoings about the world, is certain to see and hear many things which\nhe cannot discuss with strangers, but would gladly talk over with an\nintimate who could listen with sympathy and understanding, someone who\ncould laugh with him or weep if need be. It often happens too that\nsome political event will greatly perturb or amuse him, and he sits\napart longing to tell someone about it. He suddenly laughs at some\nsecret recollection or sighs audibly. But the wife only says lightly\n'What is the matter?' and shows no interest.\nThis is apt to be very trying.\nUma no Kami considered several other cases. But he reached no definite\nconclusion and sighing deeply he continued: 'We will then, as I have\nsuggested, let birth and beauty go by the board. Let her be the\nsimplest and most guileless of creatures so long as she is honest and\nof a peaceable disposition, that in the end we may not lack a place of\ntrust. And if some other virtue chances to be hers we shall treasure\nit as a godsend. But if we discover in her some small defect, it shall\nnot be too closely scrutinized. And we may be sure that if she is\nstrong in the virtues of tolerance and amiability her outward\nappearance will not be beyond measure harsh.\n'There are those who carry forbearance too far, and affecting not to\nnotice wrongs which cry out for redress seem to be paragons of misused\nfidelity. But suddenly a time comes when such a one can restrain\nherself no longer, and leaving behind her a poem couched in pitiful\nlanguage and calculated to rouse the most painful sentiments of\nremorse, she flies to some remote village in the mountains or some\ndesolate seashore, and for a long while all trace of her is lost.\n'When I was a boy the ladies-in-waiting used to tell me sad tales of\nthis kind. I never doubted that the sentiments expressed in them were\nreal, and I wept profusely. But now I am beginning to suspect that\nsuch sorrows are for the most part affectation. She has left behind\nher (this lady whom we are imagining) a husband who is probably still\nfond of her; she is making herself very unhappy, and by disappearing\nin this way is causing him unspeakable anxiety, perhaps only for the\nridiculous purpose of putting his affection to the test. Then comes\nalong some admiring friend crying \"What a heart! What depth of\nfeeling!\" She becomes more lugubrious than ever, and finally enters a\nnunnery. When she decided on this step she was perfectly sincere and\nhad not the slightest intention of ever returning to the world. Then\nsome female friend hears of it and \"Poor thing\" she cries; \"in what an\nagony of mind must she have been to do this!\" and visits her in her\ncell. When the husband, who has never ceased to mourn for her, hears\nwhat she has become, he bursts into tears, and some servant or old\nnurse, seeing this, bustles off to the nunnery with tales of the\nhusband's despair, and \"Oh Madam, what a shame, what a shame!\" Then\nthe nun, forgetting where and what she is, raises her hand to her head\nto straighten her hair, and finds that it has been shorn away. In\nhelpless misery she sinks to the floor, and do what she will, the\ntears begin to flow. Now all is lost; for since she cannot at every\nmoment be praying for strength, there creeps into her mind the sinful\nthought that she did ill to become a nun and so often does she commit\nthis sin that even Buddha must think her wickeder now than she was\nbefore she took her vows; and she feels certain that these terrible\nthoughts are leading her soul to the blackest Hell. But if the _karma_\nof their past lives should chance to be strongly weighted against a\nparting, she will be found and captured before she has taken her final\nvows. In such a case their life will be beyond endurance unless she be\nfully determined, come good or ill, this time to close her eyes to all\nthat goes amiss.\n'Again there are others who must needs be forever mounting guard over\ntheir own and their husband's affections. Such a one, if she sees in\nhim not a fault indeed but even the slightest inclination to stray,\nmakes a foolish scene, declaring with indignation that she will have\nno more to do with him.\n'But even if a man's fancy should chance indeed to have gone somewhat\nastray, yet his earlier affection may still be strong and in the end\nwill return to its old haunts. Now by her tantrums she has made a rift\nthat cannot be joined. Whereas she who when some small wrong calls for\nsilent rebuke, shows by a glance that she is not unaware; but when\nsome large offence demands admonishment knows how to hint without\nseverity, will end by standing in her master's affections better than\never she stood before. For often the sight of our own forbearance will\ngive our neighbour strength to rule his mutinous affections.\n'But she whose tolerance and forgiveness know no bounds, though this\nmay seem to proceed from the beauty and amiability of her disposition,\nis in fact displaying the shallowness of her feeling: \"The unmoored\nboat must needs drift with the stream.\" Are you not of this mind?'\nT\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d nodded. 'Some' he said 'have imagined that by arousing a\nbaseless suspicion in the mind of the beloved we can revive a waning\ndevotion. But this experiment is very dangerous. Those who recommend\nit are confident that so long as resentment is groundless one need\nonly suffer it in silence and all will soon be well. I have observed\nhowever that this is by no means the case.\n'But when all is said and done, there can be no greater virtue in\nwoman than this: that she should with gentleness and forbearance meet\nevery wrong whatsoever that falls to her share.' He thought as he said\nthis of his own sister, Princess Aoi; but was disappointed and piqued\nto discover that Genji, whose comments he awaited, was fast asleep.",

One paints the\nMountain of H\u014drai; another a raging sea-monster riding a storm;\nanother, ferocious animals from the Land beyond the sea, or faces of\nimaginary demons. Letting their fancy run wildly riot they have no\nthought of beauty, but only of how best they may astonish the\nbeholder's eye. And though nothing in their pictures is real, all is\nprobable. But ordinary hills and rivers, just as they are, houses such\nas you may see anywhere, with all their real beauty and harmony of\nform\u2014quietly to draw such scenes as this, or to show what lies behind\nsome intimate hedge that is folded away far from the world, and thick\ntrees upon some unheroic hill, and all this with befitting care for\ncomposition, proportion, and the like,\u2014such works demand the highest\nmaster's utmost skill and must needs draw the common craftsman into a\nthousand blunders. So too in handwriting, we see some who aimlessly\nprolong their cursive strokes this way or that, and hope their\nflourishes will be mistaken for genius. But true penmanship preserves\nin every letter its balance and form, and though at first some letters\nmay seem but half-formed, yet when we compare them with the copy-books\nwe find that there is nothing at all amiss.\n'So it is in these trifling matters. And how much the more in judging\nof the human heart should we distrust all fashionable airs and graces,\nall tricks and smartness, learnt only to please the outward gaze! This\nI first understood some while ago, and if you will have patience with\nme I will tell you the story.'\nSo saying, he came and sat a little closer to them, and Genji woke up.\nT\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d, in wrapt attention, was sitting with his cheek propped\nupon his hand. Uma no Kami's whole speech that night was indeed very\nmuch like a chaplain's sermon about the ways of the world, and was\nrather absurd. But upon such occasions as this we are easily led on\ninto discussing our own ideas and most private secrets without the\nleast reserve.\n'It happened when I was young, and in an even more humble position\nthan I am to-day' Uma no Kami continued. 'I was in love with a girl\nwho (like the drudging, faithful wife of whom I spoke a little\nwhile ago) was not a full-sail beauty; and I in my youthful vanity\nthought she was all very well for the moment, but would never do for\nthe wife of so fine a fellow as I. She made an excellent companion in\ntimes when I was at a loose end; but she was of a disposition so\nviolently jealous, that I could have put up with a little less\ndevotion if only she had been somewhat less fiercely ardent and\nexacting.\n'Thus I kept thinking, vexed by her unrelenting suspicions. But then I\nwould remember her ceaseless devotion to the interests of one who was\nafter all a person of no account, and full of remorse I made sure that\nwith a little patience on my part she would one day learn to school\nher jealousy.\n'It was her habit to minister to my smallest wants even before I was\nmyself aware of them; whatever she felt was lacking in her she strove\nto acquire, and where she knew that in some quality of mind she still\nfell behind my desires, she was at pains never to show her deficiency\nin such a way as might vex me. Thus in one way or another she was\nalways busy in forwarding my affairs, and she hoped that if all down\nto the last dew drop (as they say) were conducted as I should wish,\nthis would be set down to her credit and help to balance the defects\nin her person which meek and obliging as she might be could not (she\nfondly imagined) fail to offend me; and at this time she even hid\nherself from strangers lest their poor opinion of her looks should put\nme out of countenance.\n'I meanwhile, becoming used to her homely looks, was well content with\nher character, save for this one article of jealousy; and here she\nshowed no amendment. Then I began to think to myself \"Surely, since\nshe seems so anxious to please, so timid, there must be some way of\ngiving her a fright which will teach her a lesson, so that for a while\nat least we may have a respite from this accursed business.\" And\nthough I knew it would cost me dear, I determined to make a pretence\nof giving her up, thinking that since she was so fond of me this would\nbe the best way to teach her a lesson. Accordingly I behaved with the\ngreatest coldness to her, and she as usual began her jealous fit and\nbehaved with such folly that in the end I said to her, \"If you want to\nbe rid for ever of one who loves you dearly, you are going the right\nway about it by all these endless poutings over nothing at all. But if\nyou want to go on with me, you must give up suspecting some deep\nintrigue each time you fancy that I am treating you unkindly. Do this,\nand you may be sure I shall continue to love you dearly. It may well\nbe that as time goes on, I shall rise a little higher in the world and\nthen....\"\n'I thought I had managed matters very cleverly, though perhaps in the\nheat of the moment I might have spoken somewhat too roughly. She\nsmiled faintly and answered that if it were only a matter of bearing\nfor a while with my failures and disappointments, that did not trouble",

The\nunexpected pain was difficult to bear, but composing myself I said\ntragically \"Now you have put this mark upon me I shall get on worse\nthan ever in polite society; as for promotion, I shall be considered a\ndisgrace to the meanest public office and unable to cut a genteel\nfigure in any capacity, I shall be obliged to withdraw myself\ncompletely from the world. You and I at any rate shall certainly not\nmeet again,\" and bending my injured finger as I turned to go, I\nrecited the verse \"As on bent hand I count the times that we have met,\nit is not one finger only that bears witness to my pain.\" And she, all\nof a sudden bursting into tears ... \"If still in your heart only you\nlook for pains to count, then were our hands best employed in\nparting.\" After a few more words I left her, not for a moment thinking\nthat all was over.\n'Days went by, and no news. I began to be restless. One night when I\nhad been at the Palace for the rehearsal of the Festival music, heavy\nsleet was falling; and I stood at the spot where those of us who came\nfrom the Palace had dispersed, unable to make up my mind which way to\ngo. For in no direction had I anything which could properly be called\na home. I might of course take a room in the Palace precincts; but I\nshivered to think of the cheerless grandeur that would surround me.\nSuddenly I began to wonder what she was thinking, how she was looking;\nand brushing the snow off my shoulders, I set out for her house. I own\nI felt uneasy; but I thought that after so long a time her anger must\nsurely have somewhat abated. Inside the room a lamp showed dimly,\nturned to the wall. Some undergarments were hung out upon a large,\nwarmly-quilted couch, the bed-hangings were drawn up, and I made sure\nthat she was for some reason actually expecting me. I was priding\nmyself on having made so lucky a hit, when suddenly, \"Not at home!\";\nand on questioning the maid I learnt that she had but that very night\ngone to her parents' home, leaving only a few necessary servants\nbehind. The fact that she had till now sent no poem or conciliatory\nmessage seemed to show some hardening of heart, and had already\ndisquieted me. Now I began to fear that her accursed suspiciousness\nand jealousy had but been a stratagem to make me grow weary of her,\nand though I could recall no further proof of this I fell into great\ndespair. And to show her that, though we no longer met, I still\nthought of her and planned for her, I got her some stuff for a dress,\nchoosing a most delightful and unusual shade of colour, and a material\nthat I knew she would be glad to have. \"For after all\" I thought \"she\ncannot want to put me altogether out of her head.\" When I informed her\nof this purchase she did not rebuff me nor make any attempt to hide\nfrom me, but to all my questions she answered quietly and composedly,\nwithout any sign that she was ashamed of herself.\n'At last she told me that if I went on as before, she could never\nforgive me; but if I would promise to live more quietly she would take\nme back again. Seeing that she still hankered after me I determined to\nschool her a little further yet, and said that I could make no\nconditions and must be free to live as I chose. So the tug of war went\non; but it seems that it hurt her far more than I knew, for in a\nlittle while she fell into a decline and died, leaving me aghast at\nthe upshot of my wanton game. And now I felt that, whatever faults she\nmight have had, her devotion alone would have made her a fit wife for\nme. I remembered how both in trivial talk and in consideration of\nimportant matters she had never once shown herself at a loss, how in\nthe dyeing of brocades she rivalled the Goddess of Tatsuta who tints\nthe autumn leaves, and how in needlework and the like she was not less\nskilful than Tanabata, the Weaving-lady of the sky.'\nHere he stopped, greatly distressed at the recollection of the lady's\nmany talents and virtues.\n'The Weaving-lady and the Herd boy' said T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d 'enjoy a love\nthat is eternal. Had she but resembled the Divine Sempstress in\nthis, you would not, I think, have minded her being a little less",

I wonder that with this rare creature in mind\nyou pronounce the world to be so blank a place.'\n'Listen' replied Uma no Kami 'About the same time there was another\nlady whom I used to visit. She was of higher birth than the first; her\nskill in poetry, cursive writing, and lute-playing, her readiness of\nhand and tongue were all marked enough to show that she was not a\nwoman of trivial nature; and this indeed was allowed by those who knew\nher. To add to this she was not ill-looking and sometimes, when I\nneeded a rest from my unhappy persecutress, I used to visit her\nsecretly. In the end I found that I had fallen completely in love with\nher. After the death of the other I was in great distress. But it was\nno use brooding over the past and I began to visit my new lady more\nand more often. I soon came to the conclusion that she was frivolous\nand I had no confidence that I should have liked what went on when I\nwas not there to see. I now visited her only at long intervals and at\nlast decided that she had another lover.\n'It was during the Godless Month,[5] on a beautiful moonlight night.\nAs I was leaving the Palace I met a certain young courtier, who, when\nI told him that I was driving out to spend the night at the\nDainagon's, said that my way was his and joined me. The road passed my\nlady's house and here it was that he alighted, saying that he had an\nengagement which he should have been very sorry not to fulfil. The\nwall was half in ruins and through its gaps I saw the shadowy waters\nof the lake. It would not have been easy (for even the moonbeams\nseemed to loiter here!) to hasten past so lovely a place, and when he\nleft his coach I too left mine.\n'At once this man (whom I now knew to be that other lover whose\nexistence I had guessed) went and sat unconcernedly on the bamboo\nskirting of the portico and began to gaze at the moon. The\nchrysanthemums were just in full bloom, the bright fallen leaves were\ntumbling and tussling in the wind. It was indeed a scene of wonderful\nbeauty that met our eyes. Presently he took a flute out of the folds\nof his dress and began to play upon it. Then putting the flute aside,\nhe began to murmur \"Sweet is the shade\"[6] and other catches. Soon a\npleasant-sounding native zithern[7] began to tune up somewhere within\nthe house and an ingenious accompaniment was fitted to his careless\nwarblings. Her zithern was tuned to the autumn-mode, and she played\nwith so much tenderness and feeling that though the music came from\nbehind closed shutters it sounded quite modern and passionate,[8] and\nwell accorded with the soft beauty of the moonlight. The courtier was\nravished, and as he stepped forward to place himself right under her\nwindow he turned to me and remarked in a self-satisfied way that\namong the fallen leaves no other footstep had left its mark. Then\nplucking a chrysanthemum, he sang:\nStrange that the music of your lute,\nThese matchless flowers and all the beauty of the night,\nHave lured no other feet to linger at your door!\nand then, beseeching her pardon for his halting verses, he begged her\nto play again while one was still near who longed so passionately to\nhear her. When he had paid her many other compliments, the lady",

This lady too I only saw from time to time, but such\nwas her situation that I had once fondly imagined myself the only\noccupant of her thoughts. However that night's work dissolved the last\nshred of my confidence, and I never saw her again.\n'These two experiences, falling to my lot while I was still so young,\nearly deprived me of any hope from women. And since that time my view\nof them has but grown the blacker. No doubt to you at your age they\nseem very entrancing, these \"dew-drops on the grass that fall if they\nare touched,\" these \"glittering hailstones that melt if gathered in\nthe hand.\" But when you are a little older you will think as I do.\nTake my advice in this at least; beware of caressing manners and soft,\nentangling ways. For if you are so rash as to let them lead you\nastray, you will soon find yourselves cutting a very silly figure\nin the world.'\nT\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d as usual nodded his assent, and Genji's smile seemed such\nas to show that he too accepted Uma no Kami's advice. 'Your two\nstories were certainly very dismal' he said, laughing. And here T\u014d no\nCh\u016bj\u014d interposed: 'I will tell you a story about myself. There was a\nlady whose acquaintance I was obliged to make with great secrecy. But\nher beauty well rewarded my pains, and though I had no thought of\nmaking her my wife I grew so fond of her that I soon found I could not\nput her out of my head and she seemed to have complete confidence in\nme. Such confidence indeed that when from time to time I was obliged\nto behave in such a way as might well have aroused her resentment, she\nseemed not to notice that anything was amiss, and even when I\nneglected her for many weeks, she treated me as though I were still\ncoming every day. In the end indeed I found this readiness to receive\nme whenever and however I came very painful, and determined for the\nfuture to merit her strange confidence.\n'Her parents were dead and this was perhaps why, since I was all she\nhad in the world, she treated me with such loving meekness, despite\nthe many wrongs I did her. I must own that my resolution did not last\nlong, and I was soon neglecting her worse than before. During this\ntime (I did not hear of it till afterwards) someone who had discovered\nour friendship began to send her veiled messages which cruelly\nfrightened and distressed her. Knowing nothing of the trouble she was\nin, although I often thought of her I neither came nor wrote to her\nfor a long while. Just when she was in her worst despair a child was\nborn, and at last in her distress she plucked a blossom of the flower\nthat is called \"Child of my Heart\" and sent it to me.'\nAnd here T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d's eyes filled with tears.\n'Well' said Genji 'and did she write a message to go with it?' 'Oh\nnothing very out-of-the-ordinary' said T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d. 'She wrote:\n\"Though tattered be the hillman's hedge, deign sometimes to look with\nkindness upon the Child-flower that grows so sweetly there.\" This\nbrought me to her side. As usual she did not reproach me, but she\nlooked sad enough, and when I considered the dreary desolation of this\nhome where every object wore an aspect no less depressing than the\nwailing voices of the crickets in the grass, she seemed to me like\nsome unhappy princess in an ancient story, and wishing her to feel\nthat it was for the mother's sake and not the child's that I had come,\nI answered with a poem in which I called the Child-flower by its other\nname \"Bed-flower,\" and she replied with a poem that darkly hinted at\nthe cruel tempest which had attended this Bed-flower's birth. She\nspoke lightly and did not seem to be downright angry with me; and when\na few tears fell she was at great pains to hide them, and seemed more\ndistressed at the thought that I might imagine her to be unhappy than\nactually resentful of my conduct towards her. So I went away with an\neasy mind and it was some while before I came again. When at last I\nreturned she had utterly disappeared, and if she is alive she must be\nliving a wretched vagrant life. If while I still loved her she had but\nshown some outward sign of her resentment, she would not have ended\nthus as an outcast and wanderer; for I should never have dared to\nleave her so long neglected, and might in the end have acknowledged\nher and made her mine forever. The child too was a sweet creature, and\nI have spent much time in searching for them, but still without success.\n'It is, I fear, as sorrowful a tale as that which Uma no Kami has told\nyou.

The zithern-player had much talent to\nher credit, but was a great deal too light-headed. And your diffident\nlady, T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d, seems to me to be a very suspicious case. The world\nappears to be so constructed that we shall in the end be always at a\nloss to make a reasoned choice; despite all our picking, sifting and\ncomparing we shall never succeed in finding this in all ways and to\nall lengths adorable and impeccable female.'\n'I can only suggest the Goddess Kichij\u014d'[10] said T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d 'and I\nfear that intimacy with so holy and majestic a being might prove to be\nimpracticable.'\nAt this they all laughed and T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d continued: 'But now it is\nShikibu's turn and he is sure to give us something entertaining. Come\nShikibu, keep the ball rolling!' 'Nothing of interest ever happens to\nhumble folk like myself' said Shikibu; but T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d scolded him for\nkeeping them waiting and after reflecting for a while which anecdote\nwould best suit the company, he began: 'While I was still a student at\nthe University, I came across a woman who was truly a prodigy of\nintelligence. One of Uma no Kami's demands she certainly fulfilled,\nfor it was possible to discuss with her to advantage both public\nmatters and the proper handling of one's private affairs. But not only\nwas her mind capable of grappling with any problems of this kind;\nshe was also so learned that ordinary scholars found themselves, to\ntheir humiliation, quite unable to hold their own against her.\n'I was taking lessons from her father, who was a Professor. I had\nheard that he had several daughters, and some accidental circumstance\nmade it necessary for me to exchange a word or two with one of them\nwho turned out to be the learned prodigy of whom I have spoken. The\nfather, hearing that we had been seen together, came up to me with a\nwine-cup in his hand and made an allusion to the poem of The Two\nWives.[11] Unfortunately I did not feel the least inclination towards\nthe lady. However I was very civil to her; upon which she began to\ntake an affectionate interest in me and lost no opportunity of\ndisplaying her talents by giving me the most elaborate advice how best\nI might advance my position in the world. She sent me marvellous\nletters written in a very far-fetched epistolary style and entirely in\nChinese characters; in return for which I felt bound to visit her, and\nby making her my teacher I managed to learn how to write Chinese\npoems. They were wretched, knock-kneed affairs, but I am still\ngrateful to her for it. She was not however at all the sort of woman\nwhom I should have cared to have as a wife, for though there may be\ncertain disadvantages in marrying a complete dolt, it is even worse to\nmarry a blue-stocking. Still less do princes like you and Genji\nrequire so huge a stock of intellect and erudition for your support!\nLet her but be one to whom the _karma_ of our past lives draws us in\nnatural sympathy, what matter if now and again her ignorance\ndistresses us? Come to that, even men seem to me to get along very\nwell without much learning.'\nHere he stopped, but Genji and the rest, wishing to hear the end\nof the story, cried out that for their part they found her a most\ninteresting woman. Shikibu protested that he did not wish to go on\nwith the story, but at last after much coaxing, pulling a comical wry\nface he continued: 'I had not seen her for a long time. When at last\nsome accident took me to the house, she did not receive me with her\nusual informality but spoke to me from behind a tiresome screen. Ha,\nHa, thought I foolishly, she is sulking; now is the time to have a\nscene and break with her. I might have known that she was not so\nlittle of a philosopher as to sulk about trifles; she prided herself\non knowing the ways of the world and my inconstancy did not in the\nleast disturb her.\n'She told me (speaking without the slightest tremor) that having had a\nbad cold for some weeks she had taken a strong garlic-cordial, which\nhad made her breath smell rather unpleasant and that for this reason\nshe could not come very close to me. But if I had any matter of\nspecial importance to discuss with her she was quite prepared to give\nme her attention. All this she had expressed with solemn literary\nperfection. I could think of no suitable reply, and with an \"at your\nservice\" I rose to go. Then, feeling that the interview had not been\nquite a success, she added, raising her voice \"Please come again when\nmy breath has lost its smell.\" I could not pretend I had not heard. I\nhad however no intention of prolonging my visit, particularly as the\nodour was now becoming definitely unpleasant, and looking cross I\nrecited the acrostic \"On this night marked by the strange behaviour of\nthe spider, how foolish to bid me come back to-morrow\"[12] and calling\nover my shoulder \"There is no excuse for you\"! I ran out of the\nroom. But she, following me \"If night by night and every night we met,\nin daytime too I should grow bold to meet you face to face.\" Here in\nthe second sentence she had cleverly concealed the meaning \"If I had\nhad any reason to expect you, I should not have eaten garlic.\"'\n'What a revolting story' cried the young princes, and then, laughing,\n'He must have invented it.' 'Such a woman is quite incredible; it must\nhave been some sort of ogress. You have shocked us, Shikibu!' and they\nlooked at him with disapproval. 'You must try to tell us a better\nstory than that.' 'I do not see how any story could be better' said\nShikibu, and left the room.\n'There is a tendency among men as well as women' said Uma no Kami 'so\nsoon as they have acquired a little knowledge of some kind, to want to\ndisplay it to the best advantage. To have mastered all the\ndifficulties in the Three Histories and Five Classics is no road to\namiability. But even a woman cannot afford to lack all knowledge of\npublic and private affairs. Her best way will be without regular study\nto pick up a little here and a little there, merely by keeping her\neyes and ears open. Then, if she has her wits at all about her, she\nwill soon find that she has amassed a surprising store of information.\nLet her be content with this and not insist upon cramming her letters\nwith Chinese characters which do not at all accord with her feminine\nstyle of composition, and will make the recipient exclaim in despair\n\"If only she could contrive to be a little less mannish!\" And many of\nthese characters, to which she intended the colloquial pronunciation\nto be given, are certain to be read as Chinese, and this will give the\nwhole composition an even more pedantic sound than it deserves. Even\namong our ladies of rank and fashion there are many of this sort, and\nthere are others who, wishing to master the art of verse-making,\nin the end allow it to master them, and, slaves to poetry, cannot\nresist the temptation, however urgent the business they are about or\nhowever inappropriate the time, to make use of some happy allusion\nwhich has occurred to them, but must needs fly to their desks and work\nit up into a poem. On festival days such a woman is very troublesome.\nFor example on the morning of the Iris Festival, when everyone is busy\nmaking ready to go to the temple, she will worry them by stringing\ntogether all the old tags about the \"matchless root\"[13] or on the 9th\nday of the 9th month, when everyone is busy thinking out some\ndifficult Chinese poem to fit the rhymes which have been prescribed,\nshe begins making metaphors about the \"dew on the chrysanthemums,\"\nthus diverting our attention from the far more important business\nwhich is in hand. At another time we might have found these\ncompositions quite delightful; but by thrusting them upon our notice\nat inconvenient moments, when we cannot give them proper attention,\nshe makes them seem worse than they really are. For in all matters we\nshall best commend ourselves if we study men's faces to read in them\nthe \"Why so?\" or the \"As you will\" and do not, regardless of times and\ncircumstances, demand an interest and sympathy that they have not\nleisure to give.\n'Sometimes indeed a woman should even pretend to know less than she\nknows, or say only a part of what she would like to say....'\nAll this while Genji, though he had sometimes joined in the\nconversation, had in his heart of hearts been thinking of one person\nonly, and the more he thought the less could he find a single trace of\nthose shortcomings and excesses which, so his friends had declared,\nwere common to all women. 'There is no one like her' he thought,\nand his heart was very full. The conversation indeed had not brought\nthem to a definite conclusion, but it had led to many curious\nanecdotes and reflections. So they passed the night, and at last, for\na wonder, the weather had improved. After this long residence at the\nPalace Genji knew he would be expected at the Great Hall and set out\nat once. There was in Princess Aoi's air and dress a dignified\nprecision which had something in it even of stiffness; and in the very\nact of reflecting that she, above all women, was the type of that\nsingle-hearted and devoted wife whom (as his friends had said last\nnight) no sensible man would lightly offend, he found himself\noppressed by the very perfection of her beauty, which seemed only to\nmake all intimacy with her the more impossible.\nHe turned to Lady Ch\u016bnagon, to Nakatsukasa and other attendants of the\ncommon sort who were standing near and began to jest with them. The\nday was now very hot, but they thought that flushed cheeks became\nPrince Genji very well. Aoi's father came, and standing behind the\ncurtain, began to converse very amiably. Genji, who considered the\nweather too hot for visits, frowned, at which the ladies-in-waiting\ntittered. Genji, making furious signs at them to be quiet, flung\nhimself on to a divan. In fact, he behaved far from well.\nIt was now growing dark. Someone said that the position of the Earth\nStar[14] would make it unlucky for the Prince to go back to the Palace\nthat night; and another: 'You are right. It is now set dead against\nhim.' 'But my own palace is in the same direction!' cried Genji. 'How\nvexing! where then shall I go?' and promptly fell asleep. The\nladies-in-waiting however, agreed that it was a very serious matter\nand began discussing what could be done. 'There is Ki no Kami's\nhouse' said one. This Ki no Kami was one of Genji's gentlemen in\nwaiting. 'It is in the Middle River' she went on; 'and delightfully\ncool and shady, for they have lately dammed the river and made it flow\nright through the garden.' 'That sounds very pleasant' said Genji,\nwaking up, 'besides they are the sort of people who would not mind\none's driving right in at the front gate, if one had a mind to.'[15]\nHe had many friends whose houses lay out of the unlucky direction. But\nhe feared that if he went to one of them, Aoi would think that, after\nabsenting himself so long, he was now merely using the Earth Star as\nan excuse for returning to more congenial company. He therefore\nbroached the matter to Ki no Kami, who accepted the proposal, but\nstepping aside whispered to his companions that his father Iyo no\nKami, who was absent on service, had asked him to look after his young\nwife.[16] 'I am afraid we have not sufficient room in the house to\nentertain him as I could wish.' Genji overhearing this, strove to\nreassure him, saying 'It will be a pleasure to me to be near the lady.\nA visit is much more agreeable when there is a hostess to welcome us.\nFind me some corner behind her partition...!' 'Even then, I fear you\nmay not find ...' but breaking off Ki no Kami sent a runner to his\nhouse, with orders to make ready an apartment for the Prince. Treating\na visit to so humble a house as a matter of no importance, he started\nat once, without even informing the Minister, and taking with him only\na few trusted body-servants. Ki no Kami protested against the\nprecipitation, but in vain.\nThe servants dusted and aired the eastern side-chamber of the Central\nHall and here made temporary quarters for the Prince. They were at\npains to improve the view from his windows, for example by altering\nthe course of certain rivulets. They set up a rustic wattled hedge and\nfilled the borders with the choicest plants. The low humming of\ninsects floated on the cool breeze; numberless fireflies wove\ninextricable mazes in the air. The whole party settled down near where\nthe moat flowed under the covered bridge and began to drink wine.\nKi no Kami went off in a great bustle, saying that he must find them\nsomething to eat. Genji, quietly surveying the scene, decided this was\none of those middle-class families which in last night's conversation\nhad been so highly commended. He remembered that he had heard the lady\nwho was staying in the house well spoken of and was curious to see\nher. He listened and thought that there seemed to be people in the\nwestern wing. There was a soft rustling of skirts, and from time to\ntime the sound of young and by no means disagreeable voices. They did\nnot seem to be much in earnest in their efforts to make their\nwhispering and laughter unheard, for soon one of them opened the\nsliding window. But Ki no Kami crying 'What are you thinking of?'\ncrossly closed it again. The light of a candle in the room filtered\nthrough a crack in the paper-window. Genji edged slightly closer to\nthe window in the hope of being able to see through the crack, but\nfound that he could see nothing. He listened for a while, and came to\nthe conclusion that they were sitting in the main women's apartments,\nout of which the little front room opened. They were speaking very\nlow, but he could catch enough of it to make out that they were\ntalking about him.\n'What a shame that a fine young Prince should be taken so young and\nsettled down for ever with a lady that was none of his choosing!'\n'I understand that marriage does not weigh very heavily upon him'\nsaid another. This probably meant nothing in particular, but Genji,\nwho imagined they were talking about what was uppermost in his own\nmind, was appalled at the idea that his relations with Lady Fujitsubo\nwere about to be discussed. How could they have found out? But the\nsubsequent conversation of the ladies soon showed that they knew\nnothing of the matter at all, and Genji stopped listening. Presently\nhe heard them trying to repeat the poem which he had sent with a\nnose-gay of morning-glory to Princess Asagao, daughter of Prince\nMomozono.[17] But they got the lines rather mixed up, and Genji began\nto wonder whether the lady's appearance would turn out to be on a\nlevel with her knowledge of prosody.\nAt this moment Ki no Kami came in with a lamp which he hung on the\nwall. Having carefully trimmed it, he offered Genji a tray of fruit.\nThis was all rather dull and Genji by a quotation from an old\nfolk-song hinted that he would like to meet Ki no Kami's other guests.\nThe hint was not taken. Genji began to doze, and his attendants sat\nsilent and motionless.\nThere were in the room several charming boys, sons of Ki no Kami, some\nof whom Genji already knew as pages at the Palace. There were also\nnumerous sons of Iyo no Kami; with them was a boy of twelve or\nthirteen who particularly caught Genji's fancy. He began asking whose\nsons the boys were, and when he came to this one Ki no Kami replied\n'he is the youngest son of the late Ch\u016bnagon, who loved him dearly,\nbut died while this boy was still a child. His sister married my\nfather and that is why he is living here. He is quick at his books,\nand we hope one day to send him to Court, but I fear that his lack\nof influence....'\n'Poor child!' said Genji. 'His sister, then, is your step-mother, is\nthat not so? How strange that you should stand in this relationship\nwith so young a girl! And now I come to think of it there was some\ntalk once of her being presented at Court, and I once heard the\nEmperor asking what had become of her. How changeable are the fortunes\nof the world.' He was trying to talk in a very grown-up way.\n'Indeed, Sir' answered Ki no Kami, 'her subsequent state was humbler\nthan she had reason to expect. But such is our mortal life. Yes, yes,\nand such has it always been. We have our ups and downs\u2014and the women\neven more than the men.'\n_Genji:_ 'But your father no doubt makes much of her?'\n_Ki no Kami:_ 'Makes much of her indeed! You may well say so. She\nrules his house, and he dotes on her in so wholesale and extravagant a\nfashion that all of us (and I among the foremost) have had occasion\nbefore now to call him to order, but he does not listen.'\n_Genji:_ 'How comes it then that he has left her behind in the house\nof a fashionable young Courtier? For he looks like a man of prudence\nand good sense. But pray, where is she now?'\n_Ki no Kami:_ 'The ladies have been ordered to retire to the common\nroom, but they have not yet finished all their preparations.'\nGenji's followers, who had drunk heavily, were now all lying fast\nasleep on the verandah. He was alone in his room, but could not get to\nsleep. Having at last dozed for a moment, he woke suddenly and noticed\nthat someone was moving behind the paper-window of the back wall.\nThis, he thought, must be where she is hiding, and faintly curious\nhe sauntered in that direction and stood listening. 'Where are you?' I\nsay 'Where are you?' whispered someone in a quaint, hoarse voice,\nwhich seemed to be that of the boy whom Genji had noticed earlier in\nthe evening. 'I am lying over here' another voice answered. 'Has the\nstranger gone to sleep yet? His room must be quite close to this; but\nall the same how far off he seems!' Her sleepy voice was so like the\nboy's, that Genji concluded this must be his sister.\n'He is sleeping in the wing, I saw him to-night. All that we have\nheard of him is true enough. He is as handsome as can be' whispered\nthe boy. 'I wish it were to-morrow; I want to see him properly' she\nanswered drowsily, her voice seeming to come from under the bed\nclothes. Genji was rather disappointed that she did not ask more\nquestions about him. Presently he heard the boy saying 'I am going to\nsleep over in the corner-room. How bad the light is' and he seemed to\nbe trimming the lamp. His sister's bed appeared to be in the corner\nopposite the paper-window. 'Where is Ch\u016bj\u014d?' she called. 'I am\nfrightened, I like to have someone close to me.' 'Madam' answered\nseveral voices from the servants' room, 'she is taking her bath in the\nlower house. She will be back presently.' When all was quiet again,\nGenji slipped back the bolt and tried the door. It was not fastened on\nthe other side. He found himself in an ante-room with a screen at the\nend, beyond which a light glimmered. In the half-darkness he could see\nclothes boxes and trunks strewn about in great disorder. Quietly\nthreading his way among them, he entered the inner room from which the\nvoices had proceeded. One very minute figure was couched there who, to\nGenji's slight embarrassment, on hearing his approach pushed aside the\ncloak which covered her, thinking that he was the maid for whom she\nhad sent. 'Madam, hearing you call for Ch\u016bj\u014d[18] I thought that I\nmight now put at your service the esteem in which I have long secretly\nheld you.' The lady could make nothing of all this, and terrified out\nof her wits tried hard to scream. But no sound came, for she had\nburied her face in the bed clothes.\n'Please listen' said Genji. 'This sudden intrusion must of course seem\nto you very impertinent. You do not know that for years I have waited\nfor an occasion to tell you how much I like and admire you, and if\nto-night I could not resist the temptation of paying this secret\nvisit, pray take the strangeness of my behaviour as proof of my\nimpatience to pay a homage that has long been due.' He spoke so\ncourteously and gently and looked so kind that not the devil himself\nwould have taken umbrage at his presence. But feeling that the\nsituation was not at all a proper one for a married lady she said\n(without much conviction) 'I think you have made a mistake.' She spoke\nvery low. Her bewildered air made her all the more attractive, and\nGenji, enchanted by her appearance, hastened to answer: 'Indeed I have\nmade no mistake; rather, with no guide but a long-felt deference and\nesteem, I have found my way unerringly to your side. But I see that\nthe suddenness of my visit has made you distrust my purpose. Let me\ntell you then that I have no evil intentions and seek only for someone\nto talk with me for a while about a matter which perplexes me.' So\nsaying he took her up in his arms (for she was very small) and was\ncarrying her through the ante-room when suddenly Ch\u016bj\u014d, the servant\nfor whom she had sent before, entered the bedroom. Genji gave an\nastonished cry and the maid, wondering who could have entered the\nante-room, began groping her way towards them. But coming closer she\nrecognized by the rich perfume of his dress that this could be none\nother than the Prince. And though she was sorely puzzled to know\nwhat was afoot, she dared not say a word. Had he been an ordinary\nperson, she would soon have had him by the ears. 'Nay' she thought\n'even if he were not a Prince I should do best to keep my hands off\nhim; for the more stir one makes, the more tongues wag. But if I\nshould touch this fine gentleman ...,' and all in a flutter she found\nherself obediently following Genji to his room. Here he calmly closed\nthe door upon her, saying as he did so 'You will come back to fetch\nyour mistress in the morning.' Utsusemi herself was vexed beyond\nmeasure at being thus disposed of in the presence of her own\nwaiting-maid, who could indeed draw but one conclusion from what she\nhad seen. But to all her misgivings and anxieties Genji, who had the\nart of improvising a convincing reply to almost any question, answered\nwith such a wealth of ingenuity and tender concern, that for awhile\nshe was content. But soon becoming again uneasy, 'This must all be a\ndream\u2014that you, so great a Prince, should stoop to consider so humble\na creature as I, and I am overwhelmed by so much kindness. But I think\nyou have forgotten what I am. A Zury\u014d's wife! there is no altering\nthat, and you...!' Genji now began to realize how deeply he had\ndistressed and disquieted her by his wild behaviour, and feeling\nthoroughly ashamed of himself he answered: 'I am afraid I know very\nlittle about these questions of rank and precedence. Such things are\ntoo confusing to carry in one's head. And whatever you may have heard\nof me I want to tell you for some reason or other I have till this day\ncared nothing for gallantry nor ever practised it, and that even you\ncannot be more astonished at what I have done to-night than I myself\nam.' With this and a score of other speeches he sought to win her\nconfidence. But she, knowing that if once their talk became a jot less\nformal, she would be hard put to it to withstand his singular\ncharm, was determined, even at the risk of seeming stiff and awkward,\nto show him that in trying so hard to put her at her ease he was only\nwasting his time, with the result that she behaved very boorishly\nindeed. She was by nature singularly gentle and yielding, so that the\neffort of steeling her heart and despite her feelings, playing all the\nwhile the part of the young bamboo-shoot which though so green and\ntender cannot be broken, was very painful to her; and finding that she\ncould not longer think of arguments with which to withstand his\nimportunity, she burst into tears; and though he was very sorry for\nher, it occurred to him that he would not gladly have missed that\nsight. He longed however to console her, but could not think of a way\nto do so, and said at last, 'Why do you treat me so unkindly? It is\ntrue that the manner of our meeting was strange, yet I think that Fate\nmeant us to meet. It is harsh that you should shrink from me as though\nthe World and you had never met.' So he chided her, and she: 'If this\nhad happened long ago before my troubles, before my lot was cast,\nperhaps I should have been glad to take your kindness while it\nlasted, knowing that you would soon think better of your strange\ncondescension. But now that my course is fixed, what can such meetings\nbring me save misery and regret? _Tell none that you have seen my\nhome_' she ended, quoting the old song.[19] 'Small wonder that she is\nsad' thought Genji, and he found many a tender way to comfort her. And\nnow the cock began to crow. Out in the courtyard Genji's men were\nstaggering to their feet, one crying drowsily 'How I should like to go\nto sleep again,' and another 'Make haste there, bring out his Honour's\ncoach.' Ki no Kami came out into the yard, 'What's all this hurry? It\nis only when there are women in his party that a man need hasten\nfrom a refuge to which the Earth star has sent him. Why is his\nHighness setting off in the middle of the night?'\nGenji was wondering whether such an opportunity would ever occur\nagain. How would he be able even to send her letters? And thinking of\nall the difficulties that awaited him, he became very despondent.\nCh\u016bj\u014d arrived to fetch her mistress. For a long while he would not let\nher go, and when at last he handed her over, he drew her back to him\nsaying 'How can I send news to you? For, Madam,' he said raising his\nvoice that the maid Ch\u016bj\u014d might hear 'such love as mine, and such\npitiless cruelty as yours have never been seen in the world before.'\nAlready the birds were singing in good earnest. She could not forget\nthat she was no one and he a Prince. And even now, while he was\ntenderly entreating her, there came unbidden to her mind the image of\nher husband Iyo no Suke, about whom she generally thought either not\nat all or with disdain. To think that even in a dream he might see her\nnow, filled her with shame and terror.\nIt was daylight. Genji went with her to the partition door. Indoors\nand out there was a bustle of feet. As he closed the door upon her, it\nseemed to him a barrier that shut him out from all happiness. He\ndressed, and went out on to the balcony. A blind in the western wing\nwas hastily raised. There seemed to be people behind who were looking\nat him. They could only see him indistinctly across the top of a\npartition in the verandah. Among them was one, perhaps, whose heart\nbeat wildly as she looked...?\nThe moon had not set, and though with dwindled light still shone crisp\nand clear in the dawn. It was a daybreak of marvellous beauty. But in\nthe passionless visage of the sky men read only their own comfort or\ndespair; and Genji, as with many backward glances he went upon his\nway, paid little heed to the beauty of the dawn. He would send her a\nmessage? No, even that was utterly impossible. And so, in great\nunhappiness he returned to his wife's house.",

She\nwas no great beauty, Genji reflected, and yet one could not say that\nshe was ugly. Yes, she was in every sense a member of that Middle\nClass upon which Uma no Kami had given them so complete a dissertation.\nHe stayed for some while at the Great Hall, and finding that, try as\nhe might, he could not stop thinking about her and longing for her, at\nlast in despair he sent for Ki no Kami and said to him 'Why do you not\nlet me have that boy in my service,\u2014the Ch\u016bnagon's son, whom I saw at\nyour house? He is a likely looking boy, and I might make him my\nbody-servant, or even recommend him to the Emperor.' 'I am sensible of\nyour kindness' said Ki no Kami, 'I will mention what you have said to\nthe boy's sister.' This answer irritated Genji, but he continued: 'And\nhas this lady given you step-brothers my lord?' 'Sir, she has been\nmarried these two years, but has had no child. It seems that in making\nthis marriage she disobeyed her father's last injunctions, and this\nhas set her against her husband.'\n_Genji:_ 'That is sad indeed. I am told that she is not ill-looking.\nIs that so?'\n_Ki no Kami:_ 'I believe she is considered quite passable. But I have\nhad very little to do with her. Intimacy between step-children and\nstep-parents is indeed proverbially difficult.'\nFive or six days afterwards Ki no Kami brought the boy. He was not\nexactly handsome, but he had great charm and (thought Genji) an air of\ndistinction. The Prince spoke very kindly to him and soon completely\nwon his heart. To Genji's many questions about his sister he made such\nanswers as he could, and when he seemed embarrassed or tongue-tied\nGenji found some less direct way of finding out what he wanted to\nknow, and soon put the boy at his ease. For though he vaguely realized\nwhat was going on and thought it rather odd, he was so young that he\nmade no effort to understand it, and without further question carried\nback a letter from Genji to his sister.\nShe was so much agitated by the sight of it that she burst into tears\nand, lest her brother should perceive them, held the letter in front\nof her face while she read it. It was very long. Among much else it\ncontained the verse 'Would that I might dream that dream again! Alas,\nsince first this wish was mine, not once have my eye-lids closed in\nsleep.'\nShe had never seen such beautiful writing, and as she read, a haze\nclouded her eyes. What incomprehensible fate had first dragged her\ndown to be the wife of a Zury\u014d, and then for a moment raised her so\nhigh? Still pondering, she went to her room.\nNext day, Genji again sent for the boy, who went to his sister saying\n'I am going to Prince Genji. Where is your answer to his letter?'\n'Tell him' she answered 'that there is no one here who reads such\nletters.' The boy burst out laughing. 'Why, you silly, how could I say\nsuch a thing to him. He told me himself to be sure to bring an\nanswer.' It infuriated her to think that Genji should have thus taken\nthe boy into his confidence and she answered angrily, 'He has no\nbusiness to talk to you about such things at your age. If that is\nwhat you talk about you had better not go to him any more.' 'But he\nsent for me' said the boy, and started off.\n'I was waiting for you all yesterday' said Genji when the boy\nreturned. 'Did you forget to bring the answer? Did you forget to\ncome?' The child blushed and made no reply. 'And now?' 'She said\nthere is no one at home who reads such letters.' 'How silly, what can\nbe the use of saying such things?', and he wrote another letter and\ngave it to the boy, saying: 'I expect you do not know that I used to\nmeet your sister before her marriage. She treats me in this scornful\nfashion because she looks upon me as a poor-spirited, defenceless\ncreature. Whereas she has now a mighty Deputy Governor to look after\nher. But I hope that you will promise to be my child not his. For he\nis very old, and will not be able to take care of you for long.'\nThe boy was quite content with this explanation, and admired Genji\nmore than ever. The prince kept him always at his side, even taking\nhim to the Palace. And he ordered his Chamberlain to see to it that he\nwas provided with a little Court suit. Indeed he treated him just as\nthough he were his own child.\nGenji continued to send letters; but she, thinking that the boy, young\nas he was, might easily allow a message to fall into the wrong hands\nand that then she would lose her fair name to no purpose, feeling too\n(that however much he desired it) between persons so far removed in\nrank there could be no lasting union, she answered his letters only in\nthe most formal terms.\nDark though it had been during most of the time they were together,\nshe yet had a clear recollection of his appearance, and could not deny\nto herself that she thought him uncommonly handsome. But she very much\ndoubted if he on his side really knew what she was like; indeed\nshe felt sure that the next time they met he would think her very\nplain and all would be over.\nGenji meanwhile thought about her continually. He was for ever calling\nback to memory each incident of that one meeting, and every\nrecollection filled him with longing and despair. He remembered how\nsad she had looked when she spoke to him of herself, and he longed to\nmake her happier. He thought of visiting her in secret. But the risk\nof discovery was too great, and the consequences likely to be more\nfatal to her even than to himself.\nHe had been many days at the Palace, when at last the Earth Star again\nbarred the road to his home. He set out at once, but on the way\npretended that he had just remembered the unfavourable posture of the\nstars. There was nothing to do but seek shelter again in the house on\nthe Middle River. Ki no Kami was surprised but by no means\nill-pleased, for he attributed Genji's visit to the amenity of the\nlittle pools and fountains which he had constructed in his garden.\nGenji had told the boy in the morning that he intended to visit the\nMiddle River, and since he had now become the Prince's constant\ncompanion, he was sent for at once to wait upon him in his room. He\nhad already given a message to his sister, in which Genji told her of\nhis plan. She could not but feel flattered at the knowledge that it\nwas on her account he had contrived this ingenious excuse for coming\nto the house. Yet she had, as we have seen, for some reason got it\ninto her head that at a leisurely meeting she would not please him as\nshe had done at that first fleeting and dreamlike encounter, and she\ndreaded adding a new sorrow to the burden of her thwarted and unhappy\nexistence. Too proud to let him think that she had posted herself in\nwaiting for him, she said to her servants (while the boy was busy",

I am sick of myself\nand of the world, and do not want to go on living any more.' This\nsounded so tragic that the boy began to weep. The smallness and\ndelicacy of his build, even the way in which his hair was cropped,\ngave him an astonishing resemblance to his sister, thought Genji, who\nfound his sympathy very endearing. At times he had half thought of\ncreeping away from the boy's side and searching on his own account for\nthe lady's hiding-place; but soon abandoned a project which would only\nhave involved him in the most appalling scandal. So he lay, waiting\nfor the dawn. At last, while it was still dark, so full of his own\nthoughts that he quite forgot to make his usual parting speech to his\nyoung page, he left the house. The boy's feelings were very much hurt,\nand all that day he felt lonely and injured. The lady, when no answer\ncame from Genji, thought that he had changed his mind, and though she\nwould have been very angry if he had persisted in his suit, she was\nnot quite prepared to lose him with so little ado.\nBut this was a good opportunity once and for all to lock up her heart\nagainst him. She thought that she had done so successfully, but found\nto her surprise that he still occupied an uncommonly large share of\nher thoughts. Genji, though he felt it would have been much better\nto put the whole business out of his head, knew that he had not the\nstrength of mind to do so and at last, unable to bear his wretchedness\nany longer he said to the boy 'I am feeling very unhappy. I keep on\ntrying to think of other things, but my thoughts will not obey me. I\ncan struggle no longer. You must watch for a suitable occasion, and\nthen contrive some way of bringing me into the presence of your\nsister.' This worried the boy, but he was inwardly flattered at the\nconfidence which Genji placed in him. And an opportunity soon",

Hiding Genji in the porch of the\ndouble-door of the eastern wing, he purposely banged against the\nsliding partition which separated this wing from the main part of the\nhouse, and that the maids might have the impression he did not mind\nwho heard him enter he called out crossly 'Why is the door shut on a\nhot night like this?' '\"My lady of the West\"[1] has been here since\nthis morning, and she is playing _go_ with my other lady.' Longing to\ncatch sight of her, even though she were with a companion, Genji stole\nfrom his hiding-place, and crept through a gap in the curtains. The\npartition door through which the boy had passed was still open,\nand he could see through it, right along the corridor into the room on\nthe other side. The screen which protected the entrance of this room\nwas partly folded, and the curtains which usually concealed the divan\nhad, owing to the great heat, been hooked up out of the way, so that\nhe had an excellent view.\nThe lady sitting near the lamp, half-leaning against the middle pillar\nmust, he supposed, be his beloved. He looked closely at her. She\nseemed to be wearing an unlined, dark purple dress, with some kind of\nscarf thrown over her shoulders. The poise of her head was graceful,\nbut her extreme smallness had the effect of making her seem somewhat\ninsignificant. She seemed to be trying all the while to hide her face\nfrom her companion, and there was something furtive about the\nmovements of her slender hands, which she seemed never to show for\nmore than a moment.\nHer companion was sitting right opposite him, and he could see her\nperfectly. She wore an underdress of thin white stuff, and thrown\ncarelessly over it a cloak embroidered with red and blue flowers. The\ndress was not fastened in front, showing a bare neck and breast,\nshowing even the little red sash which held up her drawers. She had\nindeed an engagingly free and easy air. Her skin was very white and\ndelicate, she was rather plump, but tall and well built. The poise of\nher head and angle of her brow were faultless, the expression of her\nmouth and eyes was very pleasing and her appearance altogether most\ndelightful. Her hair grew very thick, but was cut short so as to hang\non a level with her shoulders. It was very fine and smooth. How\nexciting it must be to have such a girl for one's daughter! Small\nwonder if Iyo no Kami was proud of her. If she was a little less\nrestless, he thought, she would be quite perfect.\nThe game was nearly over, she was clearing away the unwanted pieces.\nShe seemed to be very excitable and was making a quite unnecessary\ncommotion about the business. 'Wait a little' said her companion very\nquietly, 'here there is a stalemate. My only move is to counter-attack\nover there....' 'It is all over' said the other impatiently 'I am\nbeaten, let us count the score;' and she began counting, 'ten, twenty,\nthirty, forty' on her fingers. Genji could not help remembering the\nold song about the wash-house at Iyo ('eight tubs to the left, nine\ntubs to the right') and as this lady of Iyo, determined that nothing\nshould be left unsettled, went on stolidly counting her losses and\ngains, he thought her for the moment slightly common. It was strange\nto contrast her with Utsusemi,[2] who sat silent, her face\nhalf-covered, so that he could scarcely discern her features. But when\nhe looked at her fixedly, she, as though uneasy under this gaze of\nwhich she was not actually aware, shifted in her seat, and showed him\nher full profile. Her eyelids gave the impression of being a little\nswollen, and there was at places a certain lack of delicacy in the\nlines of her features, while her good points were not visible. But\nwhen she began to speak, it was as though she were determined to make\namends for the deficiencies of her appearance and show that she had,\nif not so much beauty, at any rate more sense than her companion.\nThe latter was now flaunting her charms with more and more careless\nabandonment. Her continual laughter and high spirits were certainly\nrather engaging, and she seemed in her way to be a most entertaining\nperson. He did not imagine that she was very virtuous, but that was\nfar from being altogether a disadvantage.\nIt amused him very much to see people behaving quite naturally\ntogether. He had lived in an atmosphere of ceremony and reserve.\nThis peep at everyday life was a most exciting novelty, and though he\nfelt slightly uneasy at spying in this deliberate way upon two persons\nwho had no notion that they were observed, he would gladly have gone\non looking, when suddenly the boy, who had been sitting by his\nsister's side, got up, and Genji slipped back again into his proper",

'I am going to sleep in the\nante-room' the boy said out loud; 'I shall leave the door open so as\nto make a draught;' and so saying he spread his mattress on the\nground, and for a while pretended to be asleep. Soon however, he got\nup and spread a screen as though to protect him from the light, and\nunder its shadow Genji slipped softly into the room.\nNot knowing what was to happen next, and much doubting whether any\ngood would come of the venture, with great trepidation he followed the\nboy to the curtain that screened the main bedroom, and pulling it\naside entered on tip-toe. But even in the drab garments which he had\nchosen for his disguise, he seemed to the boy to cut a terribly\nconspicuous figure as he passed through the midnight quietness of the\nhouse.\nUtsusemi meanwhile had persuaded herself that she was very glad Genji\nhad forgotten to pay his threatened visit. But she was still haunted\nby the memory of their one strange and dreamlike meeting, and was in\nno mood for sleep. But near her, as she lay tossing, the lady of the\n_go_ party, delighted by her visit and all the opportunities it had\nafforded for chattering to her heart's content, was already asleep.\nAnd as she was young and had no troubles she slept very soundly. The\nprincely scent which still clung to Genji's person reached the bed.\nUtsusemi raised her head, and fancied that she saw something move\nbehind a part of the curtain that was only of one thickness. Though it\nwas very dark she recognized Genji's figure. Filled with a sudden\nterror and utter bewilderment, she sprang from the bed, threw a\nfragile gauze mantle over her shoulders, and fled silently from the\nroom.\nA moment later Genji entered. He saw with delight that there was only\none person in the room, and that the bed was arranged for two. He\nthrew off his cloak, and advanced towards the sleeping figure. She\nseemed a more imposing figure than he had expected, but this did not\ntrouble him. It did indeed seem rather strange that she should be so\nsound asleep. Gradually he realized with horror that it was not she at\nall. 'It is no use' thought Genji 'saying that I have come to the\nwrong room, for I have no business anywhere here. Nor is it worth\nwhile pursuing my real lady, for she would not have vanished like this\nif she cared a straw about me.' What if it were the lady he had seen\nby the lamplight? She might not after all prove a bad exchange! But no\nsooner had he thought this than he was horrified at his own frivolity.",

            "text": "She opened her eyes. She was naturally somewhat startled, but did not\nseem to be at all seriously put out. She was a thoughtless creature in\nwhose life no very strong emotion had ever played a part. Hers was the\nflippancy that goes with inexperience, and even this sudden visitation\ndid not seem very much to perturb her.\nHe meant at first to explain that it was not to see her that he had\ncome. But to do so would have been to give away the secret which\nUtsusemi so jealously guarded from the world. There was nothing for\nit, but to pretend that his repeated visits to the house, of which the\nlady was well aware, had been made in the hope of meeting her! This\nwas a story which would not have withstood the most cursory\nexamination; but, outrageous as it was, the girl accepted it without\nhesitation.\nHe did not by any means dislike her, but at that moment all his\nthoughts were busy with the lady who had so mysteriously vanished. No\ndoubt she was congratulating herself in some safe hiding-place upon\nthe absurd situation in which she had left him. Really, she was the\nmost obstinate creature in the world! What was the use of running\nafter her? But all the same she continued to obsess him.\nBut the girl in front of him was young and gay and charming. They were\nsoon getting on very well together.\n'Is not this kind of thing much more amusing than what happens with\npeople whom one knows?' asked Genji a little later. 'Do not think\nunkindly of me. Our meeting must for the present remain a secret. I am\nin a position which does not always allow me to act as I please. Your\npeople too would no doubt interfere if they should hear of it, which\nwould be very tiresome. Wait patiently, and do not forget me.' These\nrather tepid injunctions did not strike her as at all unsatisfactory,\nand she answered very seriously 'I am afraid it will not be very easy\nfor me even to write to you. People would think it very odd.' 'Of\ncourse we must not let ordinary people into our secret' he answered,\n'but there is no reason why this little page should not sometimes\ncarry a message. Meanwhile not a word to anyone!' And with that he\nleft her, taking as he did so Utsusemi's thin scarf which had slipped\nfrom her shoulders when she fled from the room.\nHe went to wake his page who was lying not far away. The boy sprang\ninstantly to his feet, for he was sleeping very lightly, not knowing\nwhen his help might be required. He opened the door as quietly as he\ncould. 'Who is that?' someone called out in great alarm. It was the\nvoice of an old woman who worked in the house. 'It is I' answered the\nboy uneasily. 'What are you walking about here for at this time of\nnight?' and scolding as she came, she began to advance towards the\ndoor. 'Bother her' thought the boy, but he answered hastily 'It's all\nright, I am only going outside for a minute;' but just as Genji passed\nthrough the door, the moon of dawn suddenly emerged in all her\nbrightness. Seeing a grown man's figure appear in the doorway 'Whom\nhave you got with you?' the old lady asked, and then answering her own\nquestion 'Why it is Mimbu! what an outrageous height that girl has\ngrown to!' and continuing to imagine that the boy was walking with\nMimbu, a maid-servant whose lankiness was a standing joke in the\nhouse, 'and you will soon be as big as she is, little Master!' she\ncried, and so saying came out through the door that they had just\npassed through. Genji felt very uncomfortable, and making no answer on\nthe supposed Mimbu's behalf, he stood in the shadow at the end of the\ncorridor, hiding himself as best he could. 'You have been on duty,\nhaven't you dear?' said the old lady as she came towards them. 'I have\nbeen terribly bad with the colic since yesterday and was lying up, but\nthey were shorthanded last night, and I had to go and help, though I\ndid feel very queer all the while.' And then, without waiting for them\nto answer, 'Oh, my pain, my poor pain' she muttered 'I can't stop here\ntalking like this' and she hobbled past them without looking up.\nSo narrow an escape made Genji wonder more than ever whether the whole\nthing was worth while. He drove back to his house, with the boy riding\nas his postillion.\nHere he told him the story of his evening's adventure. 'A pretty mess\nyou made of it!' And when he had finished scolding the boy for his\nincompetence, he began to rail at the sister's irritating prudishness.\nThe poor child felt very unhappy, but could think of nothing to say in\nhis own or his sister's defence.\n'I am utterly wretched' said Genji. 'It is obvious that she would not\nhave behaved as she did last night unless she absolutely detested me.\nBut she might at least have the decency to send civil answers to my\nletters. Oh, well, I suppose Iyo no Kami is the better man....' So he\nspoke, thinking that she desired only to be rid of him. Yet when\nat last he lay down to rest, he was wearing her scarf hidden under his\ndress. He had put the boy by his side, and after giving much vent to\nhis exasperation, he said at last 'I am very fond of you, but I am\nafraid in future I shall always think of you in connection with this\nhateful business, and that will put an end to our friendship.' He said\nit with such conviction that the boy felt quite forlorn.\nFor a while they rested, but Genji could not sleep, and at dawn he\nsent in haste for his ink-stone. He did not write a proper letter, but\nscribbled on a piece of folded paper, in the manner of a writing\nexercise, a poem in which he compared the scarf which she had dropped\nin her flight to the dainty husk which the cicada sheds on some bank\nbeneath a tree.\nThe boy picked the paper up, and thrust it into the folds of his dress.\nGenji was very much distressed at the thought of what the other lady's\nfeelings must be; but after some reflection he decided that it would\nbe better not to send any message.\nThe scarf, to which still clung the delicate perfume of its owner, he\nwore for long afterwards beneath his dress.",

            "text": "It was at the time when he was secretly visiting the lady of the Sixth\nWard.[1] One day on his way back from the Palace he thought that he\nwould call upon his foster-mother who, having for a long while been\nvery ill, had become a nun. She lived in the Fifth Ward. After many\nenquiries he managed to find the house; but the front gate was locked\nand he could not drive in. He sent one of his servants for Koremitsu,\nhis foster-nurse's son, and while he was waiting began to examine the\nrather wretched looking by-street. The house next door was fenced with\na new paling, above which at one place were four or five panels of\nopen trellis-work, screened by blinds which were very white and bare.\nThrough chinks in these blinds a number of foreheads could be seen.\nThey seemed to belong to a group of ladies who must be peeping with\ninterest into the street below.\nAt first he thought they had merely peeped out as they passed; but he\nsoon realized that if they were standing on the floor they must be\ngiants. No, evidently they had taken the trouble to climb on to some\ntable or bed; which was surely rather odd!\nHe had come in a plain coach with no outriders. No one could possibly\nguess who he was, and feeling quite at his ease he leant forward\nand deliberately examined the house. The gate, also made of a kind of\ntrellis-work, stood ajar, and he could see enough of the interior to\nrealize that it was a very humble and poorly furnished dwelling. For a\nmoment he pitied those who lived in such a place, but then he\nremembered the song 'Seek not in the wide world to find a home; but\nwhere you chance to rest, call that your house'; and again, 'Monarchs\nmay keep their palaces of jade, for in a leafy cottage two can sleep.'\nThere was a wattled fence over which some ivy-like creeper spread its\ncool green leaves, and among the leaves were white flowers with petals\nhalf unfolded like the lips of people smiling at their own thoughts.\n'They are called Y\u016bgao, \"Evening Faces,\"' one of his servants told\nhim; 'how strange to find so lovely a crowd clustering on this\ndeserted wall!' And indeed it was a most strange and delightful thing\nto see how on the narrow tenement in a poor quarter of the town they\nhad clambered over rickety eaves and gables and spread wherever there\nwas room for them to grow. He sent one of his servants to pick some.\nThe man entered at the half-opened door, and had begun to pluck the\nflowers, when a little girl in a long yellow tunic came through a\nquite genteel sliding door, and holding out towards Genji's servant a\nwhite fan heavily perfumed with incense, she said to him 'Would you\nlike something to put them on? I am afraid you have chosen a\nwretched-looking bunch,' and she handed him the fan. Just as he was\nopening the gate on his way back, the old nurse's son Koremitsu came\nout of the other house full of apologies for having kept Genji waiting\nso long\u2014'I could not find the key of the gate' he said. 'Fortunately\nthe people of this humble quarter were not likely to recognize you and\npress or stare; but I am afraid you must have been very much bored\nwaiting in this hugger-mugger back street,' and he conducted Genji\ninto the house. Koremitsu's brother, the deacon, his brother-in-law\nMikawa no Kami and his sister all assembled to greet the Prince,\ndelighted by a visit with which they had not thought he was ever\nlikely to honour them again.",

            "text": "The nun too rose from her couch: 'For a long time I had been waiting\nto give up the world, but one thing held me back: I wanted you to see\nyour old nurse just once again as you used to know her. You never came\nto see me, and at last I gave up waiting and took my vows. Now, in\nreward for the penances which my Order enjoins, I have got back a\nlittle of my health, and having seen my dear young master again, I can\nwait with a quiet mind for the Lord Amida's Light,' and in her\nweakness she shed a few tears.\n'I heard some days ago' said Genji 'that you were very dangerously\nill, and was in great anxiety. It is sad now to find you in this\npenitential garb. You must live longer yet, and see me rise in the\nworld, that you may be born again high in the ninth sphere of Amida's\nParadise. For they say that those who died with longings unfulfilled\nare burdened with an evil Karma in their life to come.'\nPeople such as old nurses regard even the most blackguardly and\nill-favoured foster-children as prodigies of beauty and virtue. Small\nwonder then if Genji's nurse, who had played so great a part in his\nearly life, always regarded her office as immensely honourable and\nimportant, and tears of pride came into her eyes while he spoke to her.\nThe old lady's children thought it very improper that their mother,\nhaving taken holy orders, should show so lively an interest in a human\ncareer. Certain that Genji himself would be very much shocked, they\nexchanged uneasy glances. He was on the contrary deeply touched. 'When\nI was a child' he said 'those who were dearest to me were early\ntaken away, and although there were many who gave a hand to my\nupbringing, it was to you only, dear nurse, that I was deeply and\ntenderly attached. When I grew up I could not any longer be often in\nyour company. I have not even been able to come here and see you as\noften as I wanted to. But in all the long time which has passed since\nI was last here, I have thought a great deal about you and wished that\nlife did not force so many bitter partings upon us.'\nSo he spoke tenderly. The princely scent of the sleeve which he had\nraised to brush away his tears filled the low and narrow room, and\neven the young people, who had till now been irritated by their\nmother's obvious pride at having been the nurse of so splendid a\nprince, found themselves in tears.\nHaving arranged for continual masses to be said on the sick woman's\nbehalf, he took his leave, ordering Koremitsu to light him with a\ncandle. As they left the house he looked at the fan upon which the\nwhite flowers had been laid. He now saw that there was writing on it,\na poem carelessly but elegantly scribbled: 'The flower that puzzled\nyou was but the _Y\u016bgao_, strange beyond knowing in its dress of\nshining dew.' It was written with a deliberate negligence which seemed\nto aim at concealing the writer's status and identity. But for all\nthat the hand showed a breeding and distinction which agreeably\nsurprised him. 'Who lives in the house on the left?' he asked.\nKoremitsu, who did not at all want to act as a go-between, replied\nthat he had only been at his mother's for five or six days and had\nbeen so much occupied by her illness that he had not asked any\nquestions about the neighbours. 'I want to know for a quite harmless\nreason' said Genji. 'There is something about this fan which raises a\nrather important point. I positively must settle it. You would oblige\nme by making enquiries from someone who knows the neighbourhood.'\nKoremitsu went at once to the house next door and sent for\nthe steward. 'This house' the man said 'belongs to a certain",

He is living in the country, but my lady is still\nhere; and as she is young and loves company, her brothers who are in\nservice at the Court often come here to visit her.' 'And that is about\nall one can expect a servant to know' said Koremitsu when he repeated\nthis information. It occurred at once to Genji that it was one of\nthese Courtiers who had written the poem. Yes, there was certainly a\nself-confident air in the writing. It was by someone whose rank\nentitled him to have a good opinion of himself. But he was\nromantically disposed; it was too painful to dismiss altogether the\nidea that, after all, the verses might really have been meant for him,\nand on a folded paper he wrote: 'Could I but get a closer view, no\nlonger would they puzzle me\u2014the flowers that all too dimly in the\ngathering dusk I saw.' This he wrote in a disguised hand and gave to\nhis servant. The man reflected that though the senders of the fan had\nnever seen Genji before, yet so well known were his features, that\neven the glimpse they had got from the window might easily have\nrevealed to them his identity. He could imagine the excitement with\nwhich the fan had been despatched and the disappointment when for so\nlong a time no answer came. His somewhat rudely belated arrival would\nseem to them to have been purposely contrived. They would all be agog\nto know what was in the reply, and he felt very nervous as he\napproached the house.\nMeanwhile, lighted only by a dim torch, Genji quietly left his nurse's\nhome. The blinds of the other house were now drawn and only the\nfire-fly glimmer of a candle shone through the gap between them.\nWhen he reached his destination[2] a very different scene met his\neyes. A handsome park, a well-kept garden; how spacious and\ncomfortable it all was! And soon the magnificent owner of these\nsplendours had driven from his head all thought of the wooden paling,\nthe shutters and the flowers.\nHe stayed longer than he intended, and the sun was already up when he\nset out for home. Again he passed the house with the shutters. He had\ndriven through the quarter countless times without taking the\nslightest interest in it; but that one small episode of the fan had\nsuddenly made his daily passage through these streets an event of\ngreat importance. He looked about him eagerly, and would have liked to\nknow who lived in all the houses.\nFor several days Koremitsu did not present himself at Genji's palace.\nWhen at last he came, he explained that his mother was growing much\nweaker and it was very difficult for him to get away. Then drawing\nnearer, he said in a low voice 'I made some further enquiries, but\ncould not find out much. It seems that someone came very secretly in\nJune and has been living there ever since; but who she really is not\neven her own servants know. I have once or twice peeped through a hole\nin the hedge and caught a glimpse of some young women; but their\nskirts were rolled back and tucked in at their belts, so I think they\nmust have been waiting-maids. Yesterday some while after sunset I saw\na lady writing a letter. Her face was calm, but she looked very\nunhappy, and I noticed that some of her women were secretly weeping.'\nGenji was more curious than ever.\nThough his master was of a rank which brought with it great\nresponsibilities, Koremitsu knew that in view of his youth and\npopularity the young prince would be thought to be positively\nneglecting his duty if he did not indulge in a few escapades, and that\neveryone would regard his conduct as perfectly natural and proper\neven when it was such as they would not have dreamed of permitting to\nordinary people.\n'Hoping to get a little further information,' he said, 'I found an\nexcuse for communicating with her, and received in reply a very\nwell-worded answer in a cultivated hand. She must be a girl of quite\ngood position.' 'You must find out more' said Genji; 'I shall not be\nhappy till I know all about her.'",

Her unkindness had not\naffected him as it would have affected most people. If she had\nencouraged him he would soon have regarded the affair as an appalling\nindiscretion which he must put an end to at all costs; whereas now he\nbrooded continually upon his defeat and was forever plotting new ways\nto shake her resolution.\nHe had never, till the day of his visit to the foster-nurse, been\ninterested in anyone of quite the common classes. But now, since that\nrainy night's conversation, he had explored (so it seemed to him)\nevery corner of society, including in his survey even those categories\nwhich his friends had passed over as utterly remote and improbable. He\nthought of the lady who had, so to speak, been thrown into his life as\nan extra. With how confiding an air she had promised that she would\nwait! He was very sorry about her, but he was afraid that if he wrote\nto her Utsusemi might find out and that would prejudice his chances.\nHe would write to her afterwards....\nSuddenly at this point Iyo no Suke himself was announced. He had\njust returned from his province, and had lost no time in paying his\nrespects to the prince. The long journey by boat had made him look\nrather swarthy and haggard. 'Really' thought Genji 'he is not at all\nan attractive man!' Still it was possible to talk to him; for if a man\nis of decent birth and breeding, however broken he may be by age or\nmisfortune, he will always retain a certain refinement of mind and\nmanners which prevent him from becoming merely repulsive. They were\nbeginning to discuss the affairs of Iyo's province and Genji was even\njoking with him, when a sudden feeling of embarrassment came over him.\nWhy should those recollections make him feel so awkward? Iyo no Suke\nwas quite an old man, it had done him no harm. 'These scruples are\nabsurd' thought Genji. However, she was right in thinking it was\ntoo queer, too ill-assorted a match; and remembering Uma no Kami's\nwarnings, he felt that he had behaved badly. Though her unkindness\nstill deeply wounded him, he was almost glad for Iyo's sake that she\nhad not relented.\n'My daughter is to be married' Iyo was saying 'And I am going to take\nmy wife back with me to my province.' Here was a double surprise. At\nall costs he must see Utsusemi once again. He spoke with her brother\nand the boy discussed the matter with her. It would have been\ndifficult enough for anyone to have carried on an intrigue with the\nprince under such circumstances as these. But for her, so far below\nhim in rank and beset by new restrictions, it had now become\nunthinkable. She could not however bear to lose all contact with him,\nand not only did she answer his letters much more kindly than before,\nbut took pains, though they were written with apparent negligence, to\nadd little touches that would give him pleasure and make him see that\nshe still cared for him. All this he noticed, and though he was vexed\nthat she would not relent towards him, he found it impossible to\nput her out of his mind.\nAs for the other girl, he did not think that she was at all the kind",

            "text": "of person to go on pining for him once she was properly settled with a\nhusband; and he now felt quite happy about her.\nIt was autumn. Genji had brought so many complications into his life\nthat he had for some while been very irregular in his visits to the\nGreat Hall, and was in great disgrace there. The lady[3] in the grand\nmansion was very difficult to get on with; but he had surmounted so\nmany obstacles in his courtship of her that to give her up the moment\nhe had won her seemed absurd. Yet he could not deny that the blind\nintoxicating passion which possessed him while she was still\nunattainable, had almost disappeared. To begin with, she was far too\nsensitive; then there was the disparity of their ages,[4] and the\nconstant dread of discovery which haunted him during those painful\npartings at small hours of the morning. In fact, there were too many\ndisadvantages.\nIt was a morning when mist lay heavy over the garden. After being many\ntimes roused Genji at last came out of Rokuj\u014d's room, looking very\ncross and sleepy. One of the maids lifted part of the folding-shutter,\nseeming to invite her mistress to watch the prince's departure. Rokuj\u014d\npulled aside the bed-curtains and tossing her hair back over her\nshoulders looked out into the garden. So many lovely flowers were\ngrowing in the borders that Genji halted for a while to enjoy them.\nHow beautiful he looked standing there, she thought. As he was nearing\nthe portico the maid who had opened the shutters came and walked by\nhis side. She wore a light green skirt exquisitely matched to the\nseason and place; it was so hung as to show to great advantage\nthe grace and suppleness of her stride. Genji looked round at her.\n'Let us sit down for a minute on the railing here in the corner,' he\nsaid. 'She seems very shy' he thought, 'but how charmingly her hair\nfalls about her shoulders,' and he recited the poem: 'Though I would\nnot be thought to wander heedlessly from flower to flower, yet this\nmorning's pale convolvulus I fain would pluck!' As he said the lines\nhe took her hand and she answered with practised ease: 'You hasten, I\nobserve, to admire the morning flowers while the mist still lies about\nthem,' thus parrying the compliment by a verse which might be\nunderstood either in a personal or general sense. At this moment a\nvery elegant page wearing the most bewitching baggy trousers came\namong the flowers brushing the dew as he walked, and began to pick a\nbunch of the convolvuli. Genji longed to paint the scene.\nNo one could see him without pleasure. He was like the flowering tree\nunder whose shade even the rude mountain peasant delights to rest. And\nso great was the fascination he exercised that those who knew him\nlonged to offer him whatever was dearest to them. One who had a\nfavourite daughter would ask for nothing better than to make her\nGenji's handmaiden. Another who had an exquisite sister was ready for\nher to serve in his household, though it were at the most menial\ntasks. Still less could these ladies who on such occasions as this\nwere privileged to converse with him and stare at him as much as they\npleased, and were moreover young people of much sensibility\u2014how could\nthey fail to delight in his company and note with much uneasiness that\nhis visits were becoming far less frequent than before?\nBut where have I got to? Ah, yes. Koremitsu had patiently continued\nthe enquiry with which Genji entrusted him. 'Who the mistress is' he\nsaid, 'I have not been able to discover; and for the most part\nshe is at great pains not to show herself. But more than once in the\ngeneral confusion, when there was the sound of a carriage coming along\npast that great row of tenement houses, and all the maid-servants were\npeering out into the road, the young lady whom I suppose to be the\nmistress of the house slipped out along with them. I could not see her\nclearly, but she seemed to be very pretty.\n'One day, seeing a carriage with outriders coming towards the house,\none of the maids rushed off calling out \"Ukon, Ukon, come quickly and\nlook. The Captain's carriage is coming this way.\" At once a\npleasant-faced lady no longer young, came bustling out. \"Quietly,\nquietly\" she said holding up a warning finger; \"how do you know it is\nthe Captain? I shall have to go and look,\" and she slipped out. A sort\nof rough drawbridge leads from the garden into the lane. In her\nexcitement the good lady caught her skirt in it and falling flat on\nher face almost tumbled into the ditch: \"A bad piece of work His\nHoliness of Katsuragi[5] made here!\" she grumbled; but her curiosity\ndid not seem to be at all damped and she stared harder than ever at\nthe approaching carriage. The visitor was dressed in a plain, wide\ncloak. He had attendants with him, whose names the excited\nservant-girls called out as one after another they came near enough to\nbe recognized; and the odd thing is that the names were certainly\nthose of T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d's[6] grooms and pages.'\n'I must see that carriage for myself' said Genji. What if this should\nbe the very lady whom Ch\u016bj\u014d, at the time of that rainy night's\nconversation, despaired of rediscovering? Koremitsu, noting that Genji\nwas listening with particular attention continued: 'I must tell you\nthat I too have reason to be interested in this house, and while\nmaking enquiries on my own account I discovered that the young lady\nalways addresses the other girls in the house as though they were her\nequals. But when, pretending to be taken in by this comedy, I began\nvisiting there, I noticed that though the older ladies played their\npart very well, the young girls would every now and then curtsey or\nslip in a \"My Lady\" without thinking; whereupon the others would\nhasten to cover up the mistake as best they might, saying anything\nthey could think of to make it appear that there was no mistress among\nthem,' and Koremitsu laughed as he recollected it.\n'Next time I come to visit your mother' said Genji, 'you must let me\nhave a chance of peeping at them.' He pictured to himself the queer,\ntumbled-down house. She was only living there for the time being; but\nall the same she must surely belong to that 'bottom class' which they\nhad dismissed as having no possible bearing on the discussion. How\namusing it would be to show that they were wrong and that after all\nsomething of interest might be discovered in such a place!\nKoremitsu, anxious to carry out his master's every wish and intent\nalso on his own intrigue, contrived at last by a series of ingenious\nstratagems to effect a secret meeting between Genji and the mysterious\nlady. The details of the plan by which he brought this about would\nmake a tedious story, and as is my rule in such cases I have thought\nit better to omit them.\nGenji never asked her by what name he was to call her, nor did he\nreveal his own identity. He came very poorly dressed and\u2014what was most\nunusual for him\u2014on foot. But Koremitsu regarded this as too great a\ntribute to so unimportant a lady, and insisted upon Genji riding his\nhorse, while he walked by his side. In doing so he sacrificed his\nown feelings; for he too had reasons for wishing to create a good\nimpression in the house, and he knew that by arriving in this rather\nundignified way he would sink in the estimation of the inhabitants.\nFortunately his discomfiture was almost unwitnessed, for Genji took\nwith him only the one attendant who had on the first occasion plucked\nthe flowers\u2014a boy whom no one was likely to recognize; and lest\nsuspicions should be aroused, he did not even take advantage of his\npresence in the neighbourhood to call at his foster-nurse's house.\nThe lady was very much mystified by all these precautions and made\ngreat efforts to discover something more about him. She even sent\nsomeone after him to see where he went to when he left her at\nday-break; but he succeeded in throwing his pursuer off the scent and\nshe was no wiser than before. He was now growing far too fond of her.\nHe was miserable if anything interfered with his visits; and though he\nutterly disapproved of his own conduct and worried a great deal about\nit, he soon found that he was spending most of his time at her house.\nHe knew that at some time or another in their lives even the soberest\npeople lose their heads in this way; but hitherto he had never really\nlost his, or done anything which could possibly have been considered\nvery wrong. Now to his astonishment and dismay he discovered that even\nthe few morning hours during which he was separated from her were\nbecoming unendurable. 'What is it in her that makes me behave like a\nmadman?' he kept on asking himself. She was astonishingly gentle and\nunassuming, to the point even of seeming rather apathetic, rather\ndeficient perhaps in depth of character and emotion; and though she\nhad a certain air of girlish inexperience, it was clear that he was\nnot by any means her first lover; and certainly she was rather\nplebeian. What was it exactly that so fascinated him? He asked\nhimself the question again and again, but found no answer.\nShe for her part was very uneasy to see him come to her thus in shabby\nold hunting-clothes, trying always to hide his face, leaving while it\nwas still dark and everyone was asleep. He seemed like some\ndemon-lover in an old ghost-tale, and she was half-afraid. But his\nsmallest gesture showed that he was someone out of the ordinary, and\nshe began to suspect that he was a person of high rank, who had used\nKoremitsu as his go-between. But Koremitsu obstinately pretended to\nknow nothing at all about his companion, and continued to amuse\nhimself by frequenting the house on his own account.\nWhat could it mean? She was dismayed at this strange love-making\nwith\u2014she knew not whom. But about her too there was something\nfugitive, insubstantial. Genji was obsessed by the idea that, just as\nshe had hidden herself in this place, so one day she would once more\nvanish and hide, and he would never be able to find her again. There",

Of course her running away would be proof that she was not\nworth bothering about any more, and he ought, thankful for the\npleasure they had had together, simply to leave the matter at that.\nBut he knew that this was the last thing he would be likely to do.\nPeople were already beginning to be suspicious, and often for several\nnights running he was unable to visit her. This became so intolerable\nthat in his impatience he determined to bring her secretly to the\nNij\u014d-in.[7] There would be an appalling outcry if she were discovered;\nbut that must be risked.\n'I am going to take you somewhere very nice where no one will disturb\nus' he said at last. 'No, No' she cried; 'your ways are so strange, I\nshould be frightened to go with you.' She spoke in a tone of childish\nterror, and Genji answered smiling: 'One or the other of us must be a\nfox-in-disguise.[8] Here is a chance to find out which it is!' He\nspoke very kindly, and suddenly, in a tone of absolute submission, she\nconsented to do whatever he thought best. He could not but be touched\nat her willingness to follow him in what must appear to her to be the\nmost hazardous and bizarre adventure. Again he thought of T\u014d no\nCh\u016bj\u014d's story on that rainy night, and could not doubt that this must\nindeed be Ch\u016bj\u014d's fugitive lady. But he saw that she had some reason\nfor wishing to avoid all questions about her past, and he restrained\nhis curiosity. So far as he could see she showed no signs of running\naway; nor did he believe that she would do so as long as he was\nfaithful. T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d, after all, had for months on end left her to\nher own devices. But he felt that if for an instant she suspected him\nof the slightest leaning in any other direction it would be a bad\nbusiness.\nIt was the fifteenth night of the eighth month. The light of an\nunclouded full-moon shone between the ill-fitting planks of the roof\nand flooded the room. What a queer place to be lying in! thought\nGenji, as he gazed round the garret, so different from any room he had\never known before. It must be almost day. In the neighbouring houses\npeople were beginning to stir, and there was an uncouth sound of\npeasant voices: 'Eh! how cold it is! I can't believe we shall do much\nwith the crops this year.' 'I don't know what's going to happen about\nmy carrying-trade' said another; 'things look very bad.' Then (banging\non the wall of another house) 'Wake up, neighbour. Time to start.\nDid he hear, d'you think?' and they rose and went off each to the\nwretched task by which he earned his bread.\nAll this clatter and bustle going on so near her made the lady very\nuncomfortable, and indeed so dainty and fastidious a person must often\nin this miserable lodging have suffered things which would make her\nlong to sink through the floor. But however painful, disagreeable or\nprovoking were the things that happened, she gave no sign of noticing\nthem. That being herself so shrinking and delicate in her ways she\ncould yet endure without a murmur the exasperating banging and bumping\nthat was going on in every direction, aroused his admiration, and he\nfelt that this was much nicer of her than if she had shuddered with\nhorror at each sound. But now, louder than thunder, came the noise of\nthe threshing-mills, seeming so near that they could hardly believe it\ndid not come from out of the pillow itself. Genji thought that his\nears would burst. What many of the noises were he could not at all\nmake out; but they were very peculiar and startling. The whole air\nseemed to be full of crashings and bangings. Now from one side, now\nfrom another, came too the faint thud of the bleacher's mallet, and\nthe scream of wild geese passing overhead. It was all too distracting.\nTheir room was in the front of the house. Genji got up and opened the\nlong, sliding shutters. They stood together looking out. In the\ncourtyard near them was a clump of fine Chinese bamboos; dew lay thick\non the borders, glittering here no less brightly than in the great\ngardens to which Genji was better accustomed. There was a confused\nbuzzing of insects. Crickets were chirping in the wall. He had often\nlistened to them, but always at a distance; now, singing so close to\nhim, they made a music which was unfamiliar and indeed seemed far\nlovelier than that with which he was acquainted. But then,\neverything in this place where one thing was so much to his liking,\nseemed despite all drawbacks to take on a new tinge of interest and\nbeauty. She was wearing a white bodice with a soft, grey cloak over\nit. It was a poor dress, but she looked charming and almost\ndistinguished; even so, there was nothing very striking in her\nappearance\u2014only a certain fragile grace and elegance. It was when she\nwas speaking that she looked really beautiful, there was such pathos,\nsuch earnestness in her manner. If only she had a little more spirit!\nBut even as she was he found her irresistible and longed to take her\nto some place where no one could disturb them: 'I am going to take you\nsomewhere not at all far away where we shall be able to pass the rest\nof the night in peace. We cannot go on like this, parting always at\nbreak of day.' 'Why have you suddenly come to that conclusion?' she\nasked, but she spoke submissively. He vowed to her that she should be\nhis love in this and in all future lives and she answered so\npassionately that she seemed utterly transformed from the listless\ncreature he had known, and it was hard to believe that such vows were\nno novelty to her.\nDiscarding all prudence he sent for the maid Ukon and bade her order\nhis servants to fetch a coach. The affair was soon known to all the\nhousehold, and the ladies were at first somewhat uneasy at seeing\ntheir mistress carried off in this fashion; but on the whole they did\nnot think he looked the sort of person who would do her any harm. It\nwas now almost daylight. The cocks had stopped crowing. The voice of\nan old man (a pilgrim preparing for the ascent of the Holy Mountain)\nsounded somewhere not far away; and, as at each prayer he bent forward\nto touch the ground with his head, they could hear with what pain and\ndifficulty he moved. What could he be asking for in his prayers, this\nold man whose life seemed fragile as the morning dew? Namu t\u014drai\nno d\u014dshi 'Glory be to the Saviour that shall come': now they could\nhear the words. 'Listen' said Genji tenderly, 'is not that an omen\nthat our love shall last through many lives to come? 'And he recited\nthe poem: 'Do not prove false this omen of the pilgrim's chant: that\neven in lives to come our love shall last unchanged.'\nThen unlike the lovers in the 'Everlasting Wrong' who prayed that they\nmight be as the 'twin birds that share a wing' (for they remembered\nthat this story had ended very sadly) they prayed 'May our love last\ntill Maitreya comes as a Buddha into the World.' But she, still\ndistrustful, answered his poem with the verse: 'Such sorrow have I\nknown in this world that I have small hope of worlds to come.' Her\nversification was still a little tentative.[9]\nShe was thinking with pleasure that the setting moon would light them\non their way, and Genji was just saying so when suddenly the moon\ndisappeared behind a bank of clouds. But there was still great beauty\nin the dawning sky. Anxious to be gone before it was quite light, he\nhurried her away to the coach and put Ukon by her side.\nThey drove to an untenanted mansion which was not far off. While he\nwaited for the steward to come out Genji noticed that the gates were\ncrumbling away; dense shinobu-grass grew around them. So sombre an\nentrance he had never seen. There was a thick mist and the dew was so\nheavy that when he raised the carriage-blind his sleeve was drenched.\n'Never yet has such an adventure as this befallen me' said Genji; 'so\nI am, as you may imagine, rather excited,' and he made a poem in which\nhe said that though love's folly had existed since the beginning of\nthe world, never could man have set out more rashly at the break of\nday into a land unknown. 'But to you this is no great novelty?'\nShe blushed and in her turn made a poem: 'I am as the moon that walks\nthe sky not knowing what menace the cruel hills may hold in store;\nhigh though she sweeps, her light may suddenly be blotted out.'\nShe seemed very depressed and nervous. But this he attributed to the\nfact that she had probably always lived in small houses where\neverything was huddled together, and he was amused at the idea that\nthis large mansion should overawe her. They drove in, and while a room\nwas being got ready they remained in the carriage which had been drawn\nup alongside of the balustrade. Ukon, looking very innocent all the\nwhile, was inwardly comparing this excursion with her mistress's\nprevious adventures. She had noticed the tone of extreme deference\nwith which this latest lover had been received by the steward, and had\nbegun to draw her own conclusions.\nThe mist was gradually clearing away. They left the coach and went\ninto the room which had been prepared for them. Though so quickly\nimprovised, their quarters were admirably clean and well-provided, for\nthe steward's son had previously been a trusted house-servant of\nGenji's and had also worked at the Great Hall. Coming now to their\nroom he offered to send for some of Genji's gentlemen, 'For' he said\n'I cannot bear to see you going unattended.' 'Do nothing of the kind'\nsaid Genji; 'I have come here because I do not wish to be disturbed.\nNo one but yourself is to know that I have used this house,' and he\nexacted a promise of absolute secrecy. No regular meal had been\nprepared, but the steward brought them a little rice porridge. Then\nthey lay down again to sleep together for the first time in this\nunfamiliar and so strangely different place.",

            "text": "The sun was high when they woke. Genji went and opened the shutters\nhimself. How deserted the garden looked! Certainly here there was no\none to spy upon them. He looked out into the distance: dense\nwoods fast turning to jungle. And nearer the house not a flower or\nbush, but only unkempt, autumn grasslands, and a pond choked with\nweeds. It was a wild and desolate place. It seemed that the steward\nand his men must live in some outbuilding or lodge at a distance from\nthe house; for here there was no sign or sound of life. 'It is, I must\nown, a strange and forsaken place to which we have come. But no ghost\nor evil fairy will dare molest you while _I_ am here.'\nIt pained her very much that he still was masked;[10] and indeed such\na precaution was quite out of keeping with the stage at which they had\nnow arrived. So at last, reciting a poem in which he reminded her that\nall their love down to this moment when 'the flower opened its petals\nto the evening dew' had come from a chance vision seen casually from\nthe street, half-turning his face away, for a moment he let her see\nhim unmasked. 'What of the \"shining dew\"' he asked using the words\nthat she had written on the fan. 'How little knew I of its beauty who\nhad but in the twilight doubted and guessed...!'; so she answered his\npoem in a low and halting voice. She need not have feared, for to him,\npoor as the verses were, they seemed delightful. And indeed the beauty\nof his uncovered face, suddenly revealed to her in this black\nwilderness of dereliction and decay, surpassed all loveliness that she\nhad ever dreamed of or imagined. 'I cannot wonder that while I still\nset this barrier between us, you did not choose to tell me all that I\nlonged to know. But now it would be very unkind of you not to tell me\nyour name.' 'I am like the fisherman's daughter in the song'[11] she\nsaid, '\"I have no name or home.\"' But for all that she would not tell\nhim who she was, she seemed much comforted that he had let her\nsee him. 'Do as you please about it' said Genji at last; but for a\nwhile he was out of temper. Soon they had made it up again; and so the\nday passed. Presently Koremitsu came to their quarters, bringing fruit\nand other viands. He would not come in, for he was frightened that\nUkon would rate him mercilessly for the part he had played in\narranging the abduction of her mistress. He had now come to the\nconclusion that the Lady must possess charms which he had wholly\noverlooked, or Genji would certainly never have taken all this trouble\nabout her, and he was touched at his own magnanimity in surrendering\nto his master a prize which he might well have kept for himself. It\nwas an evening of marvellous stillness. Genji sat watching the sky.\nThe lady found the inner room where she was sitting depressingly dark\nand gloomy. He raised the blinds of the front room, and came to sit\nwith her. They watched the light of the sunset glowing in each other's\neyes, and in her wonder at his adorable beauty and tenderness she\nforgot all her fears. At last she was shy with him no longer, and he\nthought that the new-found boldness and merriment became her very\nwell. She lay by his side till night. He saw that she was again\nwearing the plaintive expression of a frightened child; so quickly\nclosing the partition-door he brought in the great lamp, saying:\n'Outwardly you are no longer shy with me; but I can see that deep down\nin your heart there is still some sediment of rancour and distrust. It\nis not kind to use me so,' and again he was cross with her.\nWhat were the people at the Palace thinking? Would he have been sent\nfor? How far would the messengers pursue their search? He became quite\nagitated. Then there was the great lady in the Sixth Ward.[12] What a\nfrenzy she must be in! This time, however, she really had good\ncause to be jealous. These and other unpleasant considerations were\ncrowding into his head, when looking at the girl who lay beside him so\ntrustfully, unconscious of all that was going on in his mind, he was\nsuddenly filled with an overwhelming tenderness towards her. How\ntiresome the other was, with her eternal susceptibilities, jealousies\nand suspicions! For a while at any rate he would stop seeing her. As\nthe night wore on they began sometimes to doze. Suddenly Genji saw\nstanding over him the figure of a woman, tall and majestic: 'You who\nthink yourself so fine, how comes it that you have brought to toy with\nyou here this worthless common creature, picked up at random in the\nstreets? I am astonished and displeased,' and with this she made as\nthough to drag the lady from his side. Thinking that this was some\nnightmare or hallucination, he roused himself and sat up. The lamp had\ngone out. Somewhat agitated he drew his sword and laid it beside him,\ncalling as he did so for Ukon. She came at once, looking a good deal\nscared herself. 'Please wake the watchman in the cross-wing,' he said,\n'and tell him to bring a candle.' 'All in the dark like this? How can\nI?' she answered. 'Don't be childish,' said Genji laughing and clapped\nhis hands.[13] The sound echoed desolately through the empty house. He\ncould not make anyone hear; and meanwhile he noticed that his mistress\nwas trembling from head to foot. What should he do? He was still\nundecided, when suddenly she burst out into a cold sweat. She seemed\nto be losing consciousness. 'Do not fear, Sir' said Ukon 'all her life\nshe has been subject to these nightmare fits.' He remembered now how\ntired she had seemed in the morning and how she had lain with her eyes\nturned upwards as though in pain. 'I will go myself and wake someone'\nhe said; 'I am tired of clapping with only echoes to answer me.\nDo not leave her!' and drawing Ukon towards the bed he went in the\ndirection of the main western door. But when he opened it, he found\nthat the lamp in the cross-wing had also gone out. A wind had risen.\nThe few attendants he had brought with him were already in bed. There\nwas indeed only the steward's son (the young man who had once been\nGenji's body-servant), and the one young courtier who had attended him\non all his visits. They answered when he called and sprang to their\nfeet. 'Come with a candle,' he said to the steward's son, 'and tell my\nman to get his bow and keep on twanging the string as loud as he can.\nI wonder anyone should sleep so soundly in such a deserted place. What\nhas happened to Koremitsu?' 'He waited for some time, but as you\nseemed to have no need of him, he went home, saying he would be back\nat day-break.'\nGenji's man had been an Imperial Bowman, and making a tremendous din\nwith his bow he strode towards the steward's lodge crying 'Fire, Fire'\nat the top of his voice. The twanging of the bow reminded Genji of the\nPalace. The roll-call of night courtiers must be over; the Bowman's\nroll-call must be actually going on. It was not so very late.\nHe groped his way back into the room. She was lying just as he had\nleft her, with Ukon face downwards beside her. 'What are you doing\nthere' he cried? 'Have you gone mad with fright? You have heard no\ndoubt that in such lonely places as this, fox-spirits sometimes try to\ncast a spell upon men. But, dear people, you need not fear. I have\ncome back, and will not let such creatures harm you.' And so saying he\ndragged Ukon from the bed. 'Oh, Sir' she said 'I felt so queer and\nfrightened that I fell flat down upon my face; and what my poor lady\nmust be going through I dare not think.' 'Then try not to add to her\nfright' said Genji, and pushing her aside bent over the prostate\nform. The girl was scarcely breathing. He touched her; she was quite\nlimp. She did not know him.\nPerhaps some accursed thing, some demon had tried to snatch her spirit\naway; she was so timid, so childishly helpless. The man came with the\ncandle. Ukon was still too frightened to move. Genji placed a screen\nso as to hide the bed and called the man to him. It was of course\ncontrary to etiquette that he should serve Genji himself and he\nhesitated in embarrassment, not venturing even to ascend the dais.\n'Come here' said Genji impatiently; 'use your common-sense.'\nReluctantly the man gave him the light, and as he held it towards the\nbed, he saw for a moment the figure which had stood there in his dream\nstill hovering beside the pillow; suddenly it vanished. He had read in\nold tales of such apparitions and of their power, and was in great\nalarm. But for the moment he was so full of concern for the lady who\nnow lay motionless on the bed, that he gave no thought to that\nmenacing vision, and lying down beside her, began gently to move her\nlimbs. Already they were growing cold. Her breathing had quite\nstopped. What could he do? To whom could he turn for help? He ought to\nsend for a priest. He tried to control himself, but he was very young,\nand seeing her lying there all still and pale, he could contain\nhimself no longer and crying 'Come back to me, my own darling, come\nback to life. Do not look at me so strangely!' he flung his arms about\nher. But now she was quite cold. Her face was set in a dull, senseless\nstare.\nSuddenly Ukon, who had been so busy with her own fears, came to\nherself again, and set up the most dismal weeping. He disregarded her.\nSomething had occurred to him. There was a story of how a certain\nminister was waylaid by a demon as he passed through the Southern\nHall. The man, Genji remembered, had been prostrate with fear; but in\nthe end he revived and escaped. No, she could not really be dead,\nand turning to Ukon he said firmly: 'Come now, we cannot have you\nmaking such a hideous noise in the middle of the night.' But he\nhimself was stunned with grief, and though he gave Ukon distracted\norders scarce knew what he was doing. Presently he sent for the\nsteward's son and said to him: 'Someone here has had a fright and is\nin a very bad way. I want you to go to Koremitsu's house and tell him\nto come as quickly as he can. If his brother the priest is there too,\ntake him aside and tell him quietly that I should like to see him at\nonce. But do not speak loud enough for the nun their mother to hear;\nfor I would not have her know of this excursion.' But though he\nmanaged to say the words, his brain was all the while in a hideous\nturmoil. For added to the ghastly thought that he himself had caused\nher death there was the dread and horror with which the whole place\nnow inspired him.\nIt was past midnight. A violent storm began to rise, sighing dismally",

And all the\nwhile some strange bird\u2014an owl, he supposed\u2014kept screeching hoarsely.\nUtter desolation on all sides. No human voice; no friendly sound. Why,\nwhy had he chosen this hideous place?\nUkon had fainted and was lying by her mistress's side. Was she too\ngoing to die of fright? No, no. He must not give way to such thoughts.\nHe was now the only person left who was capable of action. Was there\nnothing he could do? The candle was burning badly. He lit it again.\nOver by the screen in the corner of the main room something was\nmoving. There it was again, but in another corner now. There was a\nsound of footsteps treading cautiously. It still went on. Now they\nwere coming up behind him....\nIf only Koremitsu would return! But Koremitsu was a rover and a long\ntime was wasted in looking for him. Would it never be day? It seemed\nto him that this night was lasting a thousand years. But now,\nsomewhere a long way off, a cock crowed.\nWhy had fate seen fit to treat him thus? He felt that it must be as a\npunishment for all the strange and forbidden amours into which in\nthese last years he had despite himself been drawn, that now this\nunheard of horror had befallen him. And such things, though one may\nkeep them secret for a time, always come out in the end. He minded\nmost that the Emperor would be certain to discover sooner or later\nabout this and all his other affairs. Then there was the general\nscandal. Everyone would know. The very gutter boys would make merry\nover him. Never, never must he do such things again, or his reputation\nwould utterly collapse....\nAt last Koremitsu arrived. He prided himself on being always ready to\ncarry out his master's wishes immediately at whatever hour of the\nnight or day, and he thought it very provoking of Genji to have sent\nfor him just on the one occasion when he was not to hand. And now that\nhe had come his master did not seem able to give him any orders, but\nstood speechless in front of him.\nUkon, hearing Koremitsu's voice, suddenly came to herself and\nremembering what had happened, burst into tears. And now Genji, who\nwhile he alone was there had supported and encouraged the weeping\nmaid-servant, relieved at last by Koremitsu could contain himself no\nlonger, and suddenly realizing again the terrible thing that had\nbefallen him he burst into uncontrollable weeping. 'Something horrible\nhas happened here,' he managed to say at last, 'too dreadful to\nexplain. I have heard that when such things as this suddenly befall,\ncertain scriptures should be read. I would have this done, and prayers\nsaid. That is why I asked you to bring your brother....'\n'He went up to the mountain yesterday' said Koremitsu. 'But I see\nthat there has been terrible work here afoot. Was it in some sudden\nfit of madness that you did this thing?' Genji shook his head. So\nmoved was Koremitsu at the sight of his master weeping, that he too\nbegan to sob. Had he been an older man, versed in the ways of the\nworld, he might have been of some use in such a crisis, but both of\nthem were young and both were equally perplexed. At last Koremitsu\nsaid: 'One thing at least is clear. The steward's son must not know.\nFor though he himself can be depended upon, he is the sort of person\nwho is sure to tell all his relatives, and they might meddle\ndisastrously in the affair. We had best get clear of this house as\nquietly as we can.' 'Perhaps' said Genji; 'but it would be hard to\nfind a less frequented place than this.' 'At any rate' Koremitsu\ncontinued, 'we cannot take her to her own house; for there her\ngentlewomen, who loved her dearly, would raise such a weeping and\nwailing as would soon bring a pack of neighbours swarming around, and\nall would quickly be known. If only I knew of some mountain-temple\u2014for\nthere such things are customary[14] and pass almost unnoticed.' He\npaused and reflected. 'There is a lady I once knew who has become a\nnun and now lives on the Higashi Yama. She was my father's wet-nurse\nand is now very old and bent. She does not of course live alone; but\nno outside people come there.' A faint light was already showing in\nthe sky when Koremitsu brought the carriage in. Thinking that Genji\nwould not wish to move the body himself, he wrapt it in a rush-mat and\ncarried it towards the carriage. How small she was to hold! Her face\nwas calm and beautiful. He felt no repulsion. He could find no way to\nsecure her hair, and when he began to carry her it overflowed and\nhung towards the ground. Genji saw, and his eyes darkened. A hideous\nanguish possessed him.\nHe tried to follow the body, but Koremitsu dissuaded him, saying 'You\nmust ride back to your palace as quickly as you can; you have just\ntime to get there before the stir begins,' and putting Ukon into the\ncarriage, he gave Genji his horse. Then pulling up his silk trousers\nto the knee, he accompanied the carriage on foot. It was a very\nsingular procession; but Koremitsu, seeing his master's terrible\ndistress, forgot for the moment his own dignity and walked stolidly\non. Genji, hardly conscious of what went on around him arrived at last\nin ghostly pallor at his house. 'Where do you come from, my Lord?'\n'How ill you look.' ... Questions assailed him, but he hurried to his\nroom and lay behind his curtain. He tried to calm himself, but hideous\nthoughts tormented him. Why had he not insisted upon going with her?\nWhat if after all she were not dead and waking up should find that he\nhad thus abandoned her? While these wild thoughts chased through his\nbrain a terrible sensation of choking began to torment him. His head\nached, his body seemed to be on fire. Indeed he felt so strange that\nhe thought he too was about to die suddenly and inexplicably as she\nhad done. The sun was now high, but he did not get up. His gentlemen,\nwith murmurs of astonishment, tried every means to rouse him. He sent\naway the dainties they brought, and lay hour after hour plunged in the\ndarkest thoughts. A messenger arrived from the Emperor: 'His Majesty\nhas been uneasy since yesterday when his envoys sought everywhere for\nyour Highness in vain.'\nThe young lords too came from the Great Hall. He would see none of\nthem but T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d, and even him he made stand outside his curtain\nwhile he spoke to him: 'My foster-mother has been very ill since the\nfifth month. She shaved her head and performed other penances, in\nconsequence of which (or so it seems) she recovered a little and\ngot up, but is very much enfeebled. She sent word that she desired to\nsee me once more before she died, and as I was very fond of her when I\nwas a child, I could not refuse. While I was there a servant in the\nhouse fell ill and died quite suddenly. Out of consideration for me\nthey removed the body at nightfall. But as soon as I was told of what\nhad happened I remembered that the Fast of the Ninth Month was at hand\nand for this reason I have not thought it right to present myself to\nthe Emperor my father. Moreover, since early morning I have had a\ncough and very bad headache, so you will forgive me for treating you\nin this way.'\n'I will give the Emperor your message. But I must tell you that last\nnight when you were out he sent messengers to look for you and seemed,\nif I may venture to say so, to be in a very ill humour.' T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d\nturned to go, but pausing a moment came back to Genji's couch and said\nquietly: 'What really happened to you last night? What you told me\njust now cannot possibly be true.' 'You need not go into details,'\nanswered Genji impatiently. 'Simply tell him that unintentionally I\nbecame exposed to a pollution, and apologize to him for me as best you\ncan.' He spoke sharply, but in his heart there was only an unspeakable\nsadness; and he was very tired.\nAll day he lay hidden from sight. Once he sent for T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d's\nbrother Kur\u014ddo no Ben and gave him a formal message for the Emperor.\nThe same excuse would serve for the Great Hall, and he sent a similar\nmessage there and to other houses where he might be expected.\nAt dusk Koremitsu came. The story of Genji's pollution had turned all\nvisitors from the door, and Koremitsu found his palace utterly\ndeserted. 'What happened?' said Genji, summoning him, 'you are sure\nthat she is dead?' and holding his sleeve before his face he wept.\n'All is over; of that there is no doubt,' said Koremitsu, also in\ntears; 'and since it is not possible for them to keep the body long, I\nhave arranged with a very respectable aged priest who is my friend\nthat the ceremony shall take place to-morrow, since to-morrow chances\nto be a good calendar day.' 'And what of her gentlewoman?' asked\nGenji. 'I fear she will not live,' said Koremitsu. 'She cries out that\nshe must follow her mistress and this morning, had I not held her, she\nwould have cast herself from a high rock. She threatened to tell the\nservants at my lady's house, but I prevailed upon her to think the\nmatter over quietly before she did this.' 'Poor thing,' said Genji,\n'small wonder that she should be thus distracted. I too am feeling\nstrangely disordered and do not know what will become of me.' 'Torment\nyourself no more,' said Koremitsu. 'All things happen as they must.\nHere is one who will handle this matter very prudently for you, and\nnone shall be the wiser.' 'Happen as they must. You are right' said\nGenji 'and so I try to persuade myself. But in the pursuit of one's\nown wanton pleasures to have done harm and to have caused someone's\ndeath\u2014that is a hideous crime; a terrible load of sin to bear with me\nthrough the world. Do not tell even your sister; much less your mother\nthe nun, for I am ashamed that she should even know I have ever done\nthat kind of thing.'[15] 'Do not fear' answered Koremitsu. 'Even to\nthe priests, who must to a certain extent be let into the secret, I\nhave told a long made-up tale' and Genji felt a little easier in his\nmind.\nThe waiting-women of his palace were sorely puzzled; 'First he says he\nhas been defiled and cannot go to Court, and now he sits whispering\nand sighing.' What could it all mean? 'Again I beg you' said Genji at\nlast 'to see that everything is done as it should be.' He was thinking\nall the time of the elaborate Court funerals which he had\nwitnessed (he had, indeed, seen no others) and imagined Koremitsu\ndirecting a complicated succession of rituals. 'I will do what I can;\nit will be no such great matter,' he answered and turned to go.\nSuddenly Genji could bear no longer the thought that he should never\nsee her again. 'You will think it very foolish of me,' he said, 'but I\nam coming with you. I shall ride on horseback.' 'If your heart is set\nupon it,' said Koremitsu, 'it is not for me to reason with you. Let us\nstart soon, so that we may be back before the night is over.' So\nputting on the hunting-dress and other garments in which he had\ndisguised himself before, he left his room.\nAlready the most hideous anguish possessed him, and now, as he set out\nupon this strange journey, to the dark thoughts that filled his mind\nwas added a dread lest his visit might rouse to some fresh fury the\nmysterious power which had destroyed her. Should he go? He hesitated;\nbut though he knew that this way lay no cure for his sadness, yet if\nhe did not see her now, never again perhaps in any life to come would\nhe meet the face and form that he had loved so well. So with Koremitsu\nand the one same groom to bear him company he set out upon the road.\nThe way seemed endless. The moon of the seventeenth night had risen\nand lit up the whole space of the Kamo plain, and in the light of the\noutrunners' torches the countryside towards Toribeno now came dimly\ninto sight. But Genji in his sickness and despair saw none of this,\nand suddenly waking from the stupor into which he had fallen found\nthat they had arrived.\nThe nun's cell was in a chapel built against the wall of a wooden\nhouse. It was a desolate spot, but the chapel itself was very\nbeautiful. The light of the visitors' torches flickered through the\nopen door. In the inner room there was no sound but that of a\nwoman weeping by herself; in the outer room were several priests\ntalking together (or was it praying?) in hushed voices. In the\nneighbouring temples vespers were over and there was absolute\nstillness; only towards the Kiyomizu were lights visible and many\nfigures seemed to throng the hill-side.[16]\nA senior priest, son of the aged nun, now began to recite the\nScriptures in an impressive voice, and Genji as he listened felt the\ntears come into his eyes. He went in. Ukon was lying behind a screen;\nwhen she heard him enter, she turned the lamp to the wall. What\nterrible thing was she trying to hide from him? But when he came\nnearer he saw to his joy that the dead lady was not changed in any way\nwhatsoever, but lay there very calm and beautiful; and feeling no\nhorror or fear at all he took her hand and said, 'Speak to me once\nagain; tell me why for so short a while you came to me and filled my\nheart with gladness, and then so soon forsook me, who loved you so\nwell?' and he wept long and bitterly by her side.\nThe priests did not know who he was, but they were touched by his\nevident misery and themselves shed tears. He asked Ukon to come back\nwith him, but she answered: 'I have served this lady since she was a\nlittle child and never once for so much as an hour have I left her.\nHow can I suddenly part from one who was so dear to me and serve in\nanother's house? And I must now go and tell her people what has become\nof her; for (such is the manner of her death) if I do not speak soon,\nthere will be an outcry that it was I who was to blame, and that would\nbe a terrible thing for me, Sir,' and she burst into tears, wailing 'I\nwill lie with her upon the pyre; my smoke shall mingle with hers!'\n'Poor soul' said Genji, 'I do not wonder at your despair. But\nthis is the way of the world. Late or soon we must all go where she\nhas gone. Take comfort and trust in me.' So he sought to console her,\nbut in a moment he added: 'Those, I know, are but hollow words. I too\ncare no longer for life and would gladly follow her.' So he spoke,\ngiving her in the end but little comfort.\n'The night is far spent' said Koremitsu; 'we must now be on our way.'\nAnd so with many backward looks and a heart full to bursting he left\nthe house. A heavy dew had fallen and the mist was so thick that it\nwas hard to see the road. On the way it occurred to him that she was\nstill wearing his scarlet cloak, which he had lent her when they lay\ndown together on the last evening. How closely their lives had been\nentwined!\nNoting that he sat very unsteadily in his saddle, Koremitsu walked\nbeside him and gave him a hand. But when they came to a dyke, he lost\nhold and his master fell to the ground. Here he lay in great pain and\nbewilderment. 'I shall not live to finish the journey' he said; 'I\nhave not strength to go so far.' Koremitsu too was sorely troubled,\nfor he felt that despite all Genji's insistence, he ought never to\nhave allowed him, fever-stricken as he was, to embark upon this\ndisastrous journey. In great agitation he plunged his hands in the\nriver and prayed to Our Lady Kwannon of Kiyomizu. Genji too roused\nhimself at last and forced himself to pray inwardly to the Buddha. And\nso they managed to start upon their journey again and in the end with\nKoremitsu's help he reached his palace.\nThis sudden journey undertaken so late at night had seemed to all his\nhousehold the height of imprudence. They had noted for some while past\nhis nightly wanderings grow more and more frequent; but though often\nagitated and pre-occupied, never had he returned so haggard as that\nmorning. What could be the object of these continual excursions?\nAnd they shook their heads in great concern. Genji flung himself upon\nhis bed and lay there in fever and pain for several days. He was\ngrowing very weak. The news was brought to the Emperor who was greatly\ndistressed and ordered continual prayers to be said for him in all the\ngreat temples; and indeed there were more special services and\npurification-ceremonies and incantations than I have room to rehearse.\nWhen it became known that this prince so famous for his great charm\nand beauty, was likely soon to die, there was a great stir in all the\nkingdom.\nSick though he was he did not forget to send for Ukon and have her\nenrolled among his gentlewomen. Koremitsu, who was beside himself with\nanxiety concerning his master, yet managed on her arrival to calm\nhimself and give to Ukon friendly instruction in her new duties; for\nhe was touched by the helpless plight in which she had been left. And\nGenji, whenever he felt a little better, would use her to carry\nmessages and letters, so that she soon grew used to waiting upon him.\nShe was dressed in deep black and though not at all handsome was a",

I\nknow in what sore distress you are left by the loss of one who was for\nso many years your mistress and friend; and it was my purpose to have\ncomforted you in your bereavement by every care and kindness I could\ndevise. For this reason, indeed, it grieves me that I shall survive\nher for so short a time.' So, somewhat stiltedly, he whispered to\nUkon, and being now very weak he could not refrain from tears. Apart\nfrom the fact that his death would leave her utterly without resource,\nshe had now quite taken to him and would have been very sorry indeed\nif he had died.\nHis gentlemen ran hither and thither, distracted; the Emperor's envoys\nthronged thick as the feet of the raindrops. Hearing of his\nfather's distress and anxiety, Genji strove hard to reassure him by\npretending to some slight respite or improvement. His father-in-law\ntoo showed great concern, calling every day for news and ordering the\nperformance of various rites and potent liturgies; and it was perhaps\nas a result of this, that having been dangerously ill for more than\ntwenty days, he took a turn for the better, and soon all his symptoms\nbegan to disappear. On the night of his recovery the term of his\ndefilement also ended and hearing that the Emperor was still extremely\nuneasy about him, he determined to reassure the Court by returning to\nhis official residence at the Palace. His father-in-law came to fetch\nhim in his own carriage and rather irritatingly urged upon him all\nsorts of remedies and precautions.\nFor some while everything in the world to which he had now returned\nseemed strange to him and he indeed scarce knew himself; but by the\ntwentieth day of the ninth month his recovery was complete, nor did\nthe pallor and thinness of his face become him by any means ill.\nAt times he would stare vacantly before him and burst into loud\nweeping, and seeing this there were not wanting those who said that he\nwas surely possessed.\nOften he would send for Ukon, and once when they had been talking in\nthe still of the evening he said to her 'There is one thing which\nstill puzzles me. Why would she never tell me who she was? For even if\nshe was indeed, as she once said, \"a fisherman's child,\" it was a\nstrange perversity to use such reticence with one who loved her so\nwell.'\n'You ask why she hid her name from you?' said Ukon. 'Can you wonder at\nit? When could she have been expected to tell you her name (not that\nit would have meant much to you if you had heard it)? For from the\nbeginning you treated her with a strange mistrust, coming with such\nsecrecy and mystery as might well make her doubt whether you were\nindeed a creature of the waking world. But though you never told her\nshe knew well enough who you were, and the thought that you would not\nbe thus secret had you regarded her as more than a mere plaything or\nidle distraction was very painful to her.'\n'What a wretched series of misunderstandings' said Genji. 'For my part\nI had no mind to put a distance between us. But I had no experience in\nsuch affairs as this. There are many difficulties in the path of such\npeople as I. First and foremost I feared the anger of my father the\nEmperor; and then, the foolish jesting of the world. I felt myself\nhedged in by courtly rules and restrictions. But for all the tiresome\nconcealments that my rank forced upon me, from that first evening I\nhad so strangely set my heart upon her that though reason counselled\nme I could not hold back; and indeed it seems sometimes to me that an\nirresistible fate drove me to do the thing of which I now so bitterly\nand continually repent. But tell me more about her. For there can now\nbe no reason for concealment. When on each seventh day I cause the\nnames of the Buddhas to be written for her comfort and salvation, whom\nam I to name in my inward prayer?'\n'There can be no harm in my telling you that' said Ukon, 'and I should\nhave done so before, did I not somehow feel it a shame to be prating\nto you now about things she would not have me speak of while she was\nalive. Her parents died when she was quite small. Her father, Sammi\nCh\u016bj\u014d, loved her very dearly, but felt always that he could not give\nher all the advantages to which her great beauty entitled her; and\nstill perplexed about her future and how best to do his duty by her,\nhe died. Soon afterwards some accident brought her into the company of\nT\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d[17] who was at that time still a lieutenant and for three\nyears he made her very happy. But in the autumn of last year\ndisquieting letters began to arrive from the Great Hall of the\nRight,[18] and being by nature prone to fits of unreasoning fear she\nnow fell into a wild panic and fled to the western part of the town\nwhere she hid herself in the house of her old wet-nurse. Here she was\nvery uncomfortable, and had planned to move to a certain village in\nthe hills, when she discovered that it would be unlucky, owing to the\nposition of the stars since the beginning of the year, to make a\njourney in that direction; and (though she never told me so) I think,\nSir, it troubled her sorely that you should have come upon her when\nshe was living in so wretched a place. But there was never anyone in\nthe world like my lady for keeping things to herself; she could never\nbear that other people should know what was on her mind. I have no\ndoubt, Sir, that she sometimes behaved very oddly to you and that you\nhave seen all this for yourself.'\nYes, this was all just as T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d had described. 'I think there\nwas some mention of a child that Ch\u016bj\u014d was vexed to have lost sight\nof' said Genji more interested than ever; 'am I right?' 'Yes, indeed,'\nshe answered 'it was born in the spring of last year, a girl, and a\nfine child it was.' 'Where is it now?' asked Genji. 'Could you get\nhold of it and bring it to me here without letting anyone know where\nyou were taking it? It would be a great comfort to me in my present\nmisery to have some remembrance of her near me;' and he added, 'I\nought of course to tell Ch\u016bj\u014d, but that would lead to useless and\npainful discussions about what has happened. Somehow or other I will\nmanage to bring her up here in my palace. I think there can be no harm\nin that. And you will easily enough find some story to tell to\nwhatever people are now looking after her.' 'I am very glad that\nthis has entered your head,' said Ukon, 'it would be a poor look-out\nfor her to grow up in the quarter where she is now living. With no one\nproperly belonging to her and in such a part of the town....'\nIn the stillness of the evening, under a sky of exquisite beauty, here\nand there along the borders in front of his palace some insect croaked\nits song; the leaves were just beginning to turn. And as he looked\nupon this pleasant picture he felt ashamed at the contrast between his\nsurroundings and the little house where Y\u016bgao had lived. Suddenly\nsomewhere among the bamboo groves the bird called iyebato uttered its\nsharp note. He remembered just how she had looked when in the gardens\nof that fatal house the same bird had startled her by its cry, and\nturning to Ukon, 'How old was she?' he suddenly asked; 'for though she\nseemed childlike in her diffidence and helplessness, that may only\nhave been a sign that she was not long for this world.' 'She must have\nbeen nineteen' said Ukon. 'When my mother, who was her first\nwet-nurse, died and left me an orphan, my lady's father was pleased to\nnotice me and reared me at my lady's side. Ah Sir, when I think of it,\nI do not know how I shall live without her; for kind as people here\nmay be I do not seem to get used to them. I suppose it is that I knew\nher ways, poor lady, she having been my mistress for so many years.'\nTo Genji even the din of the cloth-beaters' mallets had become dear\nthrough recollection, and as he lay in bed he repeated those verses of\nPo Ch\u00fc-i.\n_In the eighth month and ninth month when the nights are growing long\nA thousand times, ten thousand times the fuller's stick beats._\nThe young brother still waited upon him, but he no longer brought with\nhim the letters which he had been used to bring. Utsusemi thought he\nhad at last decided that her treatment of him was too unfriendly to be\nborne, and was vexed that he should feel so. Then suddenly she\nheard of his illness, and all her vexation turned to consternation and\nanxiety. She was soon to set out upon her long journey, but this did\nnot much interest her; and to see whether Genji had quite forgotten\nher she sent him a message saying that she had been able to find no\nwords in which to express her grief at hearing the news of his\nillness. With it she sent the poem: 'I did not ask for news and you\ndid not ask why I was silent; so the days wore on and I remained in\nsorrow and dismay.' He had not forgotten her, no, not in all his\ntrouble; and his answer came: 'Of this life, fragile as the\nutsusemi's[19] shell, already I was weary, when your word came, and\ngave me strength to live anew.' The poem was written in a very\ntremulous and confused hand; but she thought the writing very\nbeautiful and it delighted her that he had not forgotten how,\ncicada-like, she had shed her scarf. There could be no harm in this\ninterchange of notes, but she had no intention of arranging a meeting.\nShe thought that at last even he had seen that there could be no sense\nin that.\nAs for Utsusemi's companion, she was not yet married, and Genji heard\nthat she had become the mistress of T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d's brother Kur\u014ddo no\nSh\u014dsh\u014d; and though he feared that Sh\u014dsh\u014d might already have taken very\nill the discovery that he was not first in the field, and did not at\nall wish to offend him, yet he had a certain curiosity about the girl\nand sent Utsusemi's little brother with a message asking if she had\nheard of his illness and the poem: 'Had I not once gathered for my\npillow a handful of the sedge that grows upon the eaves,[20] not a\ndewdrop of pretext could my present message find.' It was an acrostic\nwith many hidden meanings. He tied the letter to a tall reed and\nbade him deliver it secretly; but was afterwards very uneasy at the\nthought that it might go astray. 'If it falls into Sh\u014dsh\u014d's hands' he\nthought 'he will at once guess that it was I who was before him.' But\nafter all Sh\u014dsh\u014d would probably not take that so very hard, Genji had\nvanity enough to think.\nThe boy delivered the message when Sh\u014dsh\u014d was at a safe distance. She\ncould not help feeling a little hurt; but it was something that he had\nremembered her at all, and justifying it to herself with the excuse\nthat she had had no time to do anything better, she sent the boy\nstraight back with the verse: 'The faint wind of your favour, that but\nfor a moment blew, with grief has part befrosted the small sedge of\nthe eaves.' It was very ill-written, with all sorts of ornamental but\nmisleading strokes and flourishes; indeed with a complete lack of\nstyle. However, it served to remind him of the face he had first seen\nthat evening by the lamplight. As for the other who on that occasion\nhad sat so stiffly facing her, what determination there had been in\nher face, what a steady resolution to give no quarter!\nThe affair with the lady of the sedge was so unintentional and so\ninsignificant that though he regarded it as rather frivolous and\nindiscreet, he saw no great harm in it. But if he did not take himself\nin hand before it was too late he would soon again be involved in some\nentanglement which might finally ruin his reputation.\nOn the forty-ninth day after Y\u016bgao's death a service in her memory was\nby his orders secretly held in the Hoked\u014d on Mount Hiyei. The ritual\nperformed was of the most elaborate kind, everything that was required\nbeing supplied from the Prince's own store; and even the decoration of\nthe service books and images was carried out with the utmost\nattention. Koremitsu's brother, a man of great piety, was\nentrusted with the direction of the ceremony, and all went well. Next\nGenji sent for his old writing-master, a doctor of letters for whom he\nhad a great liking and bade him write the prayer for the dead.[21]\n'Say that I commit to Amida the Buddha one not named whom I loved, but\nlost disastrously,' and he wrote out a rough draft for the learned man\nto amend. 'There is nothing to add or alter,' said the master, deeply\nmoved. Who could it be, he wondered, at whose death the prince was so\ndistressed? (For Genji, try as he might, could not hide his tears.)\nWhen he was secretly looking through his store for largesse to give to\nthe Hoked\u014d priests, he came upon a certain dress and as he folded it\nmade the poem: 'The girdle that to-day with tears I knot, shall we\never in some new life untie?'\nTill now her spirit had wandered in the void.[22]\nBut already she must be setting out on her new life-path, and in great\nsolicitude, he prayed continually for her safety.\nHe met T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d and his heart beat violently, for he had longed to\ntell him about Y\u016bgao's child and how it was to be reared. But he\nfeared that the rest of the story would needlessly anger and distress\nhim, and he did not mention the matter. Meanwhile the servants of\nY\u016bgao's house were surprised that they had had no news from her nor\neven from Ukon, and had begun to be seriously disquieted. They had\nstill no proof that it was Genji who was her lover, but several of\nthem thought that they had recognized him and his name was whispered\namong them. They would have it that Koremitsu knew the secret, but he\npretended to know nothing whatever about Y\u016bgao's lover and found a\nway to put off all their questions; and as he was still frequenting\nthe house for his own purposes, it was easy for them to believe that\nhe was not really concerned in their mistress's affairs. Perhaps after\nall it was some blackguard of a Zury\u014d's son who, frightened of T\u014d no\nCh\u016bj\u014d's interference, had carried her off to his province. The real\nowner of the house was a daughter of Y\u016bgao's second wet-nurse, who had\nthree children of her own. Ukon had been brought up with them, but\nthey thought that it was perhaps because she was not their own sister\nthat Ukon sent them no news of their mistress, and they were in great\ndistress.\nUkon who knew that they would assail her with questions which her\npromise to Genji forbade her to answer, dared not go to the house, not\neven to get news of her lady's child. It had been put out somewhere to\nnurse, but to her great sorrow she had quite lost sight of it.\nLonging all the while to see her face once more though only in a\ndream, upon the night after the ceremony on Mount Hiyei, he had a\nvision very different from that for which he prayed. There appeared to\nhim once more, just as on that fatal night, the figure of a woman in\nmenacing posture, and he was dismayed at the thought that some demon\nwhich haunted the desolate spot might on the occasion when it did that\nterrible thing, also have entered into him and possessed him.\nIyo no Suke was to start early in the Godless Month and had announced\nthat his wife would go with him. Genji sent very handsome parting\npresents and among them with special intent he put many very exquisite\ncombs and fans. With them were silk strips to offer to the God of\nJourneys and, above all, the scarf which she had dropped, and, tied to\nit, a poem in which he said that he had kept it in remembrance of her\nwhile there was still hope of their meeting, but now returned it wet\nwith tears shed in vain. There was a long letter with the poem,\nbut this was of no particular interest and is here omitted. She sent\nno answer by the man who had brought the presents, but gave her\nbrother the poem: 'That to the changed cicada you should return her\nsummer dress shows that you too have changed and fills an insect heart\nwith woe.'\nHe thought long about her. Though she had with so strange and\ninexplicable a resolution steeled her heart against him to the end,\nyet each time he remembered that she had gone forever it filled him\nwith depression.\nIt was the first day of the tenth month, and as though in sign that\nwinter had indeed begun heavy rain fell. All day long Genji watched\nthe stormy sky. Autumn had hideously bereaved him and winter already\nwas taking from him one whom he dearly loved:\nNow like a traveller who has tried two ways in vain\nI stand perplexed where these sad seasons meet.\nNow at least we must suppose he was convinced that such secret\nadventures led only to misery.\nI should indeed be very loth to recount in all their detail matters\nwhich he took so much trouble to conceal, did I not know that if you\nfound I had omitted anything you would at once ask why, just because\nhe was supposed to be an Emperor's son, I must needs put a favourable\nshowing on his conduct by leaving out all his indiscretions; and you\nwould soon be saying that this was no history but a mere made-up tale\ndesigned to influence the judgment of posterity.

'If I could but show you the lakes and mountains of other\nprovinces, you would soon see how far they excel all that you here\nadmire'; and he began to tell him first of Mount Fuji and many another\nfamous peak, and then of the West Country with all its pleasant bays\nand shores, till he quite forgot that it was the hour of his fever.\n'Yonder, nearest to us' the man continued, pointing to the sea 'is the\nbay of Akashi in Harima.

And there it is that the daughter of a lay\npriest who was once governor of the province presides over a mansion\nof quite disproportionate and unexpected magnificence. He is the\ndescendant of a Prime Minister and was expected to cut a great figure\nin the world. But he is a man of very singular disposition and is\naverse to all society. For a time he was an officer in the Palace\nGuard, but he gave this up and accepted the province of Harima.\nHowever he soon quarrelled with the local people and, announcing that\nhe had been badly treated and was going back to the Capital, he did\nnothing of the sort, but shaved his head and became a lay priest. Then\ninstead of settling, as is usually done, on some secluded hillside, he\nbuilt himself a house on the seashore, which may seem to you a very\nstrange thing to do; but as a matter of fact, whereas in that province\nin one place or another a good many recluses have taken up their\nabode, the mountain-country is far more dull and lonely and would\nsorely have tried the patience of his young wife and child; and so as\na compromise he chose the seashore. Once when I was travelling in the\nprovince of Harima I took occasion to visit his house and noted that,\nthough at the Capital he had lived in a very modest style, here he had\nbuilt on the most magnificent and lavish scale; as though determined\nin spite of what had happened (now that he was free from the bother of\ngoverning the province) to spend the rest of his days in the greatest\ncomfort imaginable. But all the while he was making great preparations\nfor the life to come and no ordained priest could have led a more\naustere and pious life.'\n'But you spoke of his daughter?' said Genji.

'Very well then, at dawn' he said, and having nothing to\ndo till bed-time which was still a long way off, he went out on to the\nhill-side, and under cover of the heavy evening mist loitered near the\nbrushwood hedge. His attendants had gone back to the hermit's\ncave and only Koremitsu was with him. In the western wing, opposite\nwhich he was standing, was a nun at her devotions. The blind was\npartly raised. He thought she seemed to be dedicating flowers to an\nimage. Sitting near the middle pillar, a sutra-book propped upon a\nstool by her side, was another nun. She was reading aloud; there was a\nlook of great unhappiness in her face. She seemed to be about forty;\nnot a woman of the common people. Her skin was white and very fine,\nand though she was much emaciated, there was a certain roundness and\nfulness in her cheeks, and her hair, clipped short on a level with her\neyes, hung in so delicate a fringe across her brow that she looked,\nthought Genji, more elegant and even fashionable in this convent\nguise, than if her hair had been long. Two very well-conditioned maids\nwaited upon her. Several little girls came running in and out of the\nroom at play. Among them was one who seemed to be about ten years old.\nShe came running into the room dressed in a rather worn white frock\nlined with stuff of a deep saffron colour. Never had he seen a child\nlike this. What an astonishing creature she would grow into! Her hair,\nthick and wavy, stood out fan-wise about her head. She was very\nflushed and her lips were trembling. 'What is it? Have you quarrelled\nwith one of the other little girls?' The nun raised her head as she\nspoke and Genji fancied that there was some resemblance between her\nand the child. No doubt she was its mother. 'Inu has let out my\nsparrow\u2014the little one that I kept in the clothes-basket,' she said,\nlooking very unhappy. 'What a tiresome boy that Inu is!' said one of\nthe two maids. 'He deserves a good scolding for playing such a stupid\ntrick. Where can it have got to? And this after we had taken so much\ntrouble to tame it nicely! I only hope the crows have not found\nit,' and so saying she left the room. She was a pleasant-looking\nwoman, with very long, wavy hair. The others called her Nurse\nSh\u014dnagon, and she seemed to be in charge of the child. 'Come,' said\nthe nun to the little girl, 'you must not be such a baby. You are\nthinking all the time of things that do not matter at all. Just fancy!\nEven now when I am so ill that any day I may be taken from you, you do\nnot trouble your head about me, but are grieving about a sparrow. It\nis very unkind, particularly as I have told you I don't know how many\ntimes that it is naughty to shut up live things in cages. Come over\nhere!' and the child sat down beside her. Her features were very\nexquisite; but it was above all the way her hair grew, in cloudy\nmasses over her temples, but thrust back in childish fashion from her\nforehead, that struck him as marvellously beautiful. As he watched her\nand wondered what she would be like when she grew up it suddenly\noccurred to him that she bore no small resemblance to one whom he had\nloved with all his being,[1] and at the resemblance he secretly wept.\nThe nun, stroking the child's hair, now said to her: 'It's a lovely",

I have just heard that Prince Genji has come\nto the hermit yonder to be cured of an ague. But he has disguised\nhimself in so mean a habit that I did not know him, and have been so\nnear all day without going to pay my respects to him.' The nun started\nback in horror; 'How distressing! He may even have passed and seen\nus ...' and she hastened to let down the folding blind. 'I am really\nvery glad that I am to have an opportunity of visiting this Prince\nGenji of whom one hears so much. He is said to be so handsome that even\naustere old priests like myself forget in his presence the sins and\nsorrows of the life they have discarded and take heart to live a little\nlonger in a world where so much beauty dwells. But you shall hear all\nabout it....'\nBefore the old priest had time to leave the house Genji was on his way\nback to the hermit's cave. What an enchanting creature he had\ndiscovered! How right too his friends had been on that rainy night\nwhen they told him that on strange excursions such as this beauty\nmight well be found lurking in unexpected quarters! How delightful to\nhave strolled out by chance and at once made so astonishing a find!\nWhose could this exquisite child be? He would dearly love to have her\nalways near him, to be able to turn to her at any moment for\ncomfort and distraction, as once he had turned to the lady in the\nPalace.\nHe was already lying down in the hermit's cave when (everything being\nat very close quarters) he heard the voice of the old priest's\ndisciple calling for Koremitsu. 'My master has just learnt' said this\ndisciple, 'that you were lodged so near at hand; and though it grieves\nhim that you did not in passing honour him with a visit, he would at\nonce have paid his respects to the Prince, had he not thought that\nLord Genji could not be unaware of his presence in the neighbourhood\nof this hermitage, and might perhaps have refrained from visiting him\nonly because he did not wish to disclose the motive of his present\npilgrimage. But my master would remind you' continued the man, 'that\nwe too in our poor hut could provide you with straw beds to lie on,\nand should be sorry if you left without honouring us....'\n'For ten days,' answered Genji from within, 'I have been suffering\nfrom an ague which returned so constantly that I was in despair, when\nsomeone advised me to consult the hermit of this mountain, whom I\naccordingly visited. But thinking that it would be very disagreeable\nfor a sage of his repute if in such a case as mine it became known\nthat his treatment had been unsuccessful, I was at greater pains to\nconceal myself than I should have been if visiting an ordinary\nwonder-worker. Pray ask your master to accept this excuse and bid him\nenter the cave.' Thus encouraged, the priest presented himself. Genji",

After giving some details\nof his life since he had left the Capital and come to live in\nretirement on this mountain, the priest begged Genji to come back\nwith him and visit the cold spring which flowed in the garden of his\nhut. Here was an opportunity to see again the people who had so much\ninterested him. But the thought of all the stories that the old priest\nmight have told them about him made him feel rather uncomfortable.\nWhat matter? At all costs he must see that lovely child again and he\nfollowed the old priest back to his hut. In the garden the natural\nvegetation of the hill-side had been turned to skilful use. There was\nno moon, and torches had been lit along the sides of the moat, while\nfairy lanterns hung on the trees. The front parlour was very nicely\narranged. A heavy perfume of costly and exotic scents stole from\nhidden incense-burners and filled the room with a delicious fragrance.\nThese perfumes were quite unfamiliar to Genji and he supposed that\nthey must have been prepared by the ladies of the inner room, who\nwould seem to have spent considerable ingenuity in the task.\nThe priest began to tell stories about the uncertainty of this life\nand the retributions of the life to come. Genji was appalled to think\nhow heavy his own sins had already been. It was bad enough to think\nthat he would have them on his conscience for the rest of his present\nlife. But then there was also the life to come. What terrible\npunishments he had to look forward to! And all the while the priest\nwas speaking Genji thought of his own wickedness. What a good idea it\nwould be to turn hermit and live in some such place.... But\nimmediately his thoughts strayed to the lovely face which he had seen\nthat afternoon and longing to know more of her 'Who lives with you\nhere?' he asked. 'It interests me to know, because I once saw this\nplace in a dream and was astonished to recognize it when I came here\nto-day.' At this the priest laughed: 'Your dream seems to have come\nrather suddenly into the conversation,' he said, 'but I fear that\nif you pursue your enquiry, your expectations will be sadly\ndisappointed. You have probably never heard of Azechi no Dainagon, he\ndied so long ago. He married my sister, who after his death turned her\nback upon the world. Just at that time I myself was in certain\ndifficulties and was unable to visit the Capital; so for company she\ncame to join me here in my retreat.'\n'I have heard that Aseji no Dainagon had a daughter. Is that so?' said\nGenji at a venture; 'I am sure you will not think I ask the question\nwith any indiscreet intention....' 'He had an only daughter who died\nabout ten years ago. Her father had always wanted to present her at\nCourt. But she would not listen, and when he was dead and there was\nonly my sister the nun to look after her, she allowed some wretched\ngo-between to introduce her to Prince Hy\u014dbuky\u014d whose mistress she\nbecame. His wife, a proud, relentless woman, from the first pursued\nher with constant vexations and affronts; day in and day out this\nobstinate persecution continued, till at last she died of heartbreak.\nThey say that unkindness cannot kill; but I shall never say so, for\nfrom this cause alone I saw my kinswoman fall sick and perish.'\n'Then the little girl must be this lady's child,' Genji realized at\nlast. And that accounted for her resemblance to the lady in the\nPalace.[2] He felt more drawn towards her than ever. She was of good\nlineage, which is never amiss; and her rather rustic simplicity would\nbe an actual advantage when she became his pupil, as he was now\ndetermined she should; for it would make it the easier for him to\nmould her unformed tastes to the pattern of his own. 'And did the lady\nwhose sad story you have told me leave no remembrance behind her?'\nasked Genji, still hoping to turn the conversation on to the\nchild herself. 'She died only a short while after her child was born,\nand it too was a girl. The charge of it fell to my sister who is in\nfailing health and feels herself by no means equal to such a\nresponsibility.' All was now clear. 'You will think it a very strange\nproposal,' said Genji, 'but I feel that I should like to adopt this\nchild. Perhaps you would mention this to your sister? Though others\nearly involved me in marriage, their choice proved distasteful to me\nand having, as it seems, very little relish for society, I now live\nentirely alone. She is, I quite realize, a mere child, and I am not\nproposing....' Here he paused and the priest answered: 'I am very much\nobliged to you for this offer; but I am afraid it is clear that you do\n_not_ at all realize that the child in question is a mere infant. You\nwould not even find her amusing as a casual distraction. But it is\ntrue that a girl as she grows up needs the backing of powerful friends\nif she is to make her way in the world, and though I cannot promise\nyou that anything will come of it, I ought certainly to mention the\nmatter to her grandmother.'

I must also read my vespers; but I\nwill rejoin you afterwards,' and he set out to climb the hill. Genji\nfelt very disconsolate. It had begun to rain; a cold wind blew across\nthe hill, carrying with it the sound of a waterfall,\u2014audible till then\nas a gentle intermittent plashing, but now a mighty roar; and with it,\nsomnolently rising and falling, mingled the monotonous chanting of the\nscriptures. Even the most unimpressionable nature would have been\nplunged into melancholy by such surroundings. How much the more so\nPrince Genji, as he lay sleepless on his bed, continually\nplanning and counter-planning! The priest had spoken of 'vespers,' but\nthe hour was indeed very late. It was clear however that the nun was\nstill awake, for though she was making as little noise as possible,\nevery now and then her rosary would knock with a faint click against\nthe praying-stool. There was something alluring in the sound of this\nlow, delicate tapping. It seemed to come from quite close. He opened a\nsmall space between the screens which divided the living-room from the\ninner chamber and rustled his fan. He had the impression that someone\nin the inner room after a little hesitation had come towards the\nscreen as though saying to herself 'It cannot be so, yet I could have\nsworn I heard ...,' and then retreated a little, as though thinking\n'Well, it was only my fancy after all!' Now she seemed to be feeling\nher way in the dark, and Genji said aloud 'Follow the Lord Buddha and\nthough your way lie in darkness yet shall you not go astray.' Suddenly\nhearing his clear young voice in the darkness, the woman had not at\nfirst the courage to reply. But at last she managed to answer: 'In\nwhich direction, please, is He leading me? I am afraid I do not quite\nunderstand.' 'I am sorry to have startled you,' said Genji. 'I have\nonly this small request to make: that you will carry to your mistress\nthe following poem: 'Since first he saw the green leaf of the tender\nbush, never for a moment has the dew of longing dried from the\ntraveller's sleeve.' 'Surely you must know that there is no one here\nwho understands messages of that kind,' said the woman; 'I wonder whom\nyou mean?' 'I have a particular reason for wishing your mistress to\nreceive the message,' said Genji, 'and I should be obliged if you\nwould contrive to deliver it.' The nun at once perceived that the poem\nreferred to her grandchild and supposed that Genji, having been\nwrongly informed about her age, was intending to make love to\nher. But how had he discovered her grand-daughter's existence? For\nsome while she pondered in great annoyance and perplexity, and at last\nanswered prudently with a poem in which she said that 'he who was but\nspending a night upon a traveller's dewy bed could know little of\nthose whose home was forever upon the cold moss of the hill-side.'\nThus she turned his poem to a harmless meaning. 'Tell her,' said Genji",

She was terrified at being\nsuddenly commanded to appear before this illustrious personage and was\nwondering what excuse she would make. Her maids, however, were\nconvinced that Genji would be grievously offended if she did not\nappear, and at last, coming out from the women's chamber, she said to\nhim: 'Though I am no longer a young woman, I very much doubt whether I\nought to come like this. But since you sent word that you have serious\nbusiness to discuss with me, I could not refuse....' 'Perhaps' said\nGenji, 'you will think my proposal both ill-timed and frivolous. I can\nonly assure you that I mean it very seriously. Let Buddha judge....'\nBut here he broke off, intimidated by her age and gravity. 'You have\ncertainly chosen a very strange manner of communicating this proposal\nto me. But though you have not yet said what it is, I am sure you are\nquite in earnest about it.'

'I am sure that you are meaning to be very kind,'\nsaid the nun, 'but\u2014forgive me\u2014you have evidently been misinformed.\nThere is indeed a girl living here under my charge; but she is a mere\ninfant and could not be of the slightest interest to you in any way,\nso that I cannot consent to your proposal.' 'On the contrary,' said\nGenji, 'I am perfectly conversant with every detail concerning this\nchild; but if you think my sympathy for her exaggerated or misplaced,\npray pardon me for having mentioned it.' It was evident that he did\nnot in the least realize the absurdity of what he had proposed, and\nshe saw no use in explaining herself any further. The priest was now\nreturning and Genji, saying that he had not expected she would at once\nfall in with his idea and was confident that she would soon see the\nmatter in a different light, closed the screen behind her.\nThe night was almost over. In a chapel near by, the Four Meditations\nof the Law Flower were being practised. The voices of the ministrants\nwho were now chanting the Litany of Atonement came floating on the\ngusty mountain-wind, and with this solemn sound was mingled the roar\nof hurrying waters. 'Startled from my dream by a wandering gust of\nthe mountain gale, I heard the waterfall, and at the beauty of its\nmusic wept.' So Genji greeted the priest; and he in turn replied with\nthe poem 'At the noise of a torrent wherein I daily fill my bowl I am\nscarce likely to start back in wonder and delight.' 'I get so used to\nit,' he added apologetically. A heavy mist covered the morning\nsky, and even the chirruping of the mountain-birds sounded muffled and\ndim. Such a variety of flowers and blossoming trees (he did not know\ntheir names) grew upon the hill-side, that the rocks seemed to be\nspread with a many-coloured embroidery. Above all he marvelled at the\nexquisite stepping of the deer who moved across the slope, now\ntreading daintily, now suddenly pausing; and as he watched them the\nlast remnants of his sickness were dispelled by sheer delight. Though\nthe hermit had little use of his limbs, he managed by hook or crook to\nperform the mystic motions of the Guardian Spell,[3] and though his\naged voice was husky and faltering, he read the sacred text with great\ndignity and fervour. Several of Genji's friends now arrived to\ncongratulate him upon his recovery, among them a messenger from the\nPalace. The priest from the hut below brought a present of\nstrange-looking roots for which he had gone deep into the ravine. He\nbegged to be excused from accompanying Genji on his way. 'Till the end\nof the year,' he said, 'I am bound by a vow which must deprive me of\nwhat would have been a great pleasure,' and he handed Genji the\nstirrup-cup. 'Were I but able to follow my own desires,' said Genji\ntaking the cup, 'I would not leave these hills and streams. But I hear\nthat my father the Emperor is making anxious enquiry after me. I will\ncome back before the blossom is over.' And he recited the verse 'I\nwill go back to the men of the City and tell them to come\nquickly, lest the wild wind outstripping them should toss these\nblossoms from the cherry bough.' The old priest, flattered by Genji's\npoliteness and captivated by the charm of his voice, answered with the\npoem: 'Like one who finds the aloe-tree in bloom, to the flower of the",

            "text": "mountain-cherry I no longer turn my gaze.' 'I am not after all quite\nso great a rarity as the aloe-flower,' said Genji smiling.\nNext the hermit handed him a parting-cup, with the poem 'Though seldom\nI open the pine-tree door of my mountain-cell, yet have I now seen\nface to face the flower few live to see,' and as he looked up at\nGenji, his eyes filled with tears. He gave him, to keep him safe in\nfuture from all harm, a magical wand; and seeing this the nun's\nbrother in his turn presented a rosary brought back from Korea by\nPrince Sh\u014dtoku. It was ornamented with jade and was still in the same\nChinese-looking box in which it had been brought from that country.\nThe box was in an open-work bag, and a five-leafed pine-branch was\nwith it. He also gave him some little vases of blue crystal to keep\nhis medicines in, with sprays of cherry-blossom and wistaria along\nwith them, and such other presents as the place could supply. Genji\nhad sent to the Capital for gifts with which to repay his reception in\nthe mountain. First he gave a reward to the hermit, then distributed\nalms to the priests who had chanted liturgies on his behalf, and\nfinally he gave useful presents to the poor villagers of the\nneighbourhood. While he was reading a short passage from the\nscriptures in preparation for his departure, the old priest went into\nhis house and asked his sister the nun whether she had any message for\nthe Prince. 'It is very hard to say anything at present,' she said.\n'Perhaps if he still felt the same inclination four, or five years\nhence, we might begin to consider it.' 'That is just what I\nthink,' said the priest.\nGenji saw to his regret that he had made no progress whatever. In\nanswer to the nun's message he sent a small boy who belonged to the\npriest's household with the following poem: 'Last night indeed, though\nin the greyness of twilight only, I saw the lovely flower. But to-day\na hateful mist has hidden it utterly from my sight.' The nun replied:\n'That I may know whether indeed it pains you so deeply to leave this\nflower, I shall watch intently the motions of this hazy sky.' It was\nwritten in a noteworthy and very aristocratic hand, but quite without\nthe graces of deliberate artistry. While his carriage was being got\nready, a great company of young lords arrived from the Great Hall,\nsaying that they had been hard put to it to discover what had become\nof him and now desired to give him their escort. Among them were T\u014d no\nCh\u016bj\u014d, Sach\u016b Ben, and other lesser lords, who had come out of\naffection for the Prince. 'We like nothing better than waiting upon\nyou,' they said, rather aggrieved, 'it was not kind of you to leave us\nbehind.' 'But having come so far,' said another, 'it would be a pity\nto go away without resting for a while under the shadow of these\nflowering trees'; whereupon they all sat down in a row upon the moss\nunder a tall rock and passed a rough earthenware wine-jar from hand to\nhand. Close by them the stream leaped over the rocks in a magnificent\ncascade. T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d pulled out a flute from the folds of his dress\nand played a few trills upon it. Sach\u016b Ben, tapping idly with his fan,\nbegan to sing 'The Temple of Toyora.' The young lords who had come to\nfetch him were all persons of great distinction; but so striking was\nGenji's appearance as he sat leaning disconsolately against the rock\nthat no eye was likely to be turned in any other direction. One of his\nattendants now performed upon the reed-pipe; someone else turned\nout to be a skilful _sh\u014d_[4] player. Presently the old priest came out\nof his house carrying a zithern, and putting it into Genji's hands\nbegged him to play something, 'that the birds of the mountain may\nrejoice.' He protested that he was not feeling at all in the mood to\nplay; but yielding to the priest's persuasion, he gave what was really\nnot at all a contemptible performance. After that, they all got up and\nstarted for home. Everyone on the mountain, down to the humblest\npriest and youngest neophyte, was bitterly disappointed at the\nshortness of his stay, and there were many tears shed; while the old\nnun within doors was sorry to think that she had had but that one\nbrief glimpse of him and might never see him again. The priest\ndeclared that for his part he thought the Land of the Rising Sun in\nher last degenerate days ill-deserved that such a Prince should be\nborn to her, and he wiped his eyes. The little girl too was very much\npleased with him and said he was a prettier gentleman than her own\nfather. 'If you think so, you had better become his little girl\ninstead,' said her nurse. At which the child nodded, thinking that it\nwould be a very good plan indeed; and in future the best-dressed\nperson in the pictures she painted was called 'Prince Genji' and so\nwas her handsomest doll.\nOn his return to the Capital he went straight to the Palace and\ndescribed to his father the experiences of the last two days. The\nEmperor thought him looking very haggard and was much concerned. He\nasked many questions about the hermit's magical powers, to all of\nwhich Genji replied in great detail. 'He ought certainly to have been\nmade Master Magician long ago,' said His Majesty. 'His ministrations\nhave repeatedly been attended with great success, but for some reason\nhis services have escaped public acknowledgment,' and he issued a\nproclamation to this effect. The Minister of the Left came to meet him\non his way from the Presence and apologized for not having come with\nhis sons to bring him back from the mountain. 'I thought,' he said,\n'that as you had gone there secretly, you would dislike being fetched;\nbut I very much hope that you will now come and spend a few days with\nus quietly; after which I shall esteem it a privilege to escort you to\nyour palace.' He did not in the least want to go, but there was no\nescape. His father-in-law drove him to the Great Hall in his own\ncarriage, and when the bullocks had been unyoked dragged it in at the\ngate with his own hands. Such treatment was certainly meant to be very\nfriendly; but Genji found the Minister's attentions merely irritating.\nAoi's quarters had, in anticipation of Genji's coming, just been put",

Posed like a princess\nin a picture she sat almost motionless. Beautiful she certainly was.\n'I should like to tell you about my visit to the mountain, if only I\nthought that it would interest you at all or draw an answer from you.\nI hate to go on always like this.

Or rather, it is exactly what I should\nexpect; but nevertheless I find it extremely painful.' 'Yes,'\nsaid Aoi, 'it is extremely painful when people do not care what\nbecomes of one.' She glanced back over her shoulder as she spoke, her\nface full of scorn and pride, looking uncommonly handsome as she did\nso. 'You hardly ever speak,' said Genji, 'and when you do, it is only\nto say unkind things and twist one's harmless words so that they seem\nto be insults. And when I try to find some way of helping you for a\nwhile at least to be a little less disagreeable, you become more\nhopelessly unapproachable than ever. Shall I one day succeed in making\nyou understand...?' and so saying he went into their bedroom. She did\nnot follow him. He lay for a while in a state of great annoyance and\ndistress. But, probably because he did not really care about her very\nmuch one way or the other, he soon became drowsy and all sorts of\nquite different matters drifted through his head. He wanted as much as\never to have the little girl in his keeping and watch her grow to\nwomanhood. But the grandmother was right; the child was too absurdly\nyoung, and it would be very difficult to broach the matter again.",

On a slip of paper folded small and tucked\ninto the letter he wrote the poem: 'Though with all my heart I tried\nto leave it behind me, never for a moment has it left me,\u2014the fair\nface of that mountain-flower!' Though she had long passed the zenith\nof her years the nun could not but be pleased and flattered by the\nelegance of the note; for it was not only written in an exquisite\nhand, but was folded with a careless dexterity which she greatly\nadmired. She felt very sorry for him, and would have been glad, had it\nbeen in her conscience, to have sent him a more favourable reply. 'We\nwere delighted,' she wrote, 'that being in the neighbourhood you took\noccasion to pay us a visit. But I fear that when (as I very much hope\nyou will) you come here purposely to visit us, I shall not be able to\nadd anything to what I have said already. As for the poem which you\nenclose, do not expect her to answer it, for she cannot yet write her\n\"Naniwa Zu\"[5] properly, even letter by letter. Let me then answer it\nfor her: \"For as long as the cherry-blossoms remain unscattered upon\nthe shore of Onoe where wild storms blow,\u2014so long have you till now\nbeen constant!\" For my part, I am very uneasy about the matter.'\nThe priest replied to the same effect. Genji was very much\ndisappointed and after two or three days he sent for Koremitsu and\ngave him a letter for the nun, telling him at the same time to\nfind out whatever he could from Sh\u014dnagon, the child's nurse. 'What an\nimpressionable character he is,' thought Koremitsu. He had only had a\nglimpse of the child; but that had sufficed to convince him that she\nwas a mere baby, though he remembered thinking her quite pretty. What\ntrick would his master's heart be playing upon him next?\nThe old priest was deeply impressed by the arrival of a letter in the\nhands of so special and confidential a messenger. After delivering it,\nKoremitsu sought out the nurse. He repeated all that Genji had told\nhim to say and added a great deal of general information about his\nmaster. Being a man of many words he talked on and on, continually\nintroducing some new topic which had suddenly occurred to him as\nrelevant. But at the end of it all Sh\u014dnagon was just as puzzled as\neveryone else had been to account for Genji's interest in a child so\nridiculously young. His letter was very deferential. In it he said\nthat he longed to see a specimen of her childish writing done letter\nby letter, as the nun had described. As before, he enclosed a poem:\n'Was it the shadows in the mountain well that told you my purpose was\nbut jest?'[6] To which she answered 'Some perhaps that have drawn in\nthat well now bitterly repent. Can the shadows tell me if again it\nwill be so?' and Koremitsu brought a spoken message to the same\neffect, together with the assurance that so soon as the nun's health\nimproved, she intended to visit the Capital and would then communicate\nwith him again. The prospect of her visit was very exciting.\nAbout this time Lady Fujitsubo fell ill and retired for a while from\nthe Palace. The sight of the Emperor's grief and anxiety moved Genji's\npity. But he could not help thinking that this was an opportunity\nwhich must not be missed. He spent the whole of that day in a\nstate of great agitation, unable whether in his own house or at the\nPalace to think of anything else or call upon anyone. When at last the\nday was over, he succeeded in persuading her maid \u014cmy\u014dbu to take a\nmessage. The girl, though she regarded any communication between them\nas most imprudent, seeing a strange look in his face like that of one\nwho walks in a dream, took pity on him and went. The Princess looked\nback upon their former relationship as something wicked and horrible\nand the memory of it was a continual torment to her. She had\ndetermined that such a thing must never happen again.\nShe met him with a stern and sorrowful countenance, but this did not\ndisguise her charm, and as though conscious that he was unduly\nadmiring her she began to treat him with great coldness and disdain.\nHe longed to find some blemish in her, to think that he had been\nmistaken, and be at peace.\nI need not tell all that happened. The night passed only too quickly.\nHe whispered in her ear the poem: 'Now that at last we have met, would\nthat we might vanish forever into the dream we dreamed to-night!' But\nshe, still conscience-stricken: 'Though I were to hide in the darkness\nof eternal sleep, yet would my shame run through the world from tongue\nto tongue.' And indeed, as Genji knew, it was not without good cause\nthat she had suddenly fallen into this fit of apprehension and\nremorse. As he left, \u014cmy\u014dbu came running after him with his cloak and\nother belongings which he had left behind. He lay all day upon his bed\nin great torment. He sent a letter, but it was returned unopened. This\nhad happened many times in the past, but now it filled him with such\nconsternation that for two or three days he was completely prostrate\nand kept his room. All this while he was in constant dread lest\nhis father, full of solicitude, should begin enquiring what new\ntrouble had overtaken him. Fujitsubo, convinced that her ruin was\naccomplished, fell into a profound melancholy and her health grew\ndaily worse. Messengers arrived constantly from the Court begging her\nto return without delay; but she could not bring herself to go. Her\ndisorder had now taken a turn which filled her with secret foreboding,\nand she did nothing all day long but sit distractedly wondering what",

Soon it would be known and everywhere discussed. She\nwas appalled at the calamity which had overtaken her. Not knowing that\nthere was any cause for secrecy, her people were astonished that she\nhad not long ago informed the Emperor of her condition. Speculations\nwere rife, but the question was one which only the Princess herself\nwas in a position definitely to solve. \u014cmy\u014dbu and her old nurse's\ndaughter who waited upon her at her toilet and in the bath-house had\nat once noted the change and were somewhat taken aback. But \u014cmy\u014dbu was\nunwilling to discuss the matter. She had an uncomfortable suspicion\nthat it was the meeting which she arranged that had now taken effect\nwith cruel promptness and precision. It was announced in the Palace\nthat other disorders had misled those about her and prevented them\nfrom recognizing the true nature of her condition. This explanation\nwas accepted by everyone.\nThe Emperor himself was full of tender concern, and though messengers\nkept him constantly informed, the gloomiest doubts and fancies passed\ncontinually through his mind. Genji was at this time visited by a most\nterrifying and extraordinary dream. He sent for interpreters, but they\ncould make little of it. There were indeed certain passages to\nwhich they could assign no meaning at all; but this much was clear:\nthe dreamer had made a false step and must be on his guard. 'It was\nnot _my_ dream' said Genji, feeling somewhat alarmed. 'I am consulting\nyou on behalf of someone else,' and he was wondering what this 'false\nstep' could have been when news reached him of the Princess's\ncondition. This then was the disaster which his dream had portended!\nAt once he wrote her an immense letter full of passionate\nself-reproaches and exhortations. But \u014cmy\u014dbu, thinking that it would\nonly increase her agitation, refused to deliver it, and he could trust\nno other messenger. Even the few wretched lines which she had been in\nthe habit of sending to him now and again had for some while utterly\nceased.\nIn her seventh month she again appeared at Court. Overjoyed at her\nreturn, the Emperor lavished boundless affection upon her. The added\nfulness of her figure, the unwonted pallor and thinness of her face\ngave her, he thought, a new and incomparable charm. As before, all his\nleisure was spent in her company. During this time several Court\nfestivals took place and Genji's presence was constantly required;\nsometimes he was called upon to play the _koto_ or flute, sometimes to\nserve his father in other ways. On such occasions, strive as he might\nto show no trace of embarrassment or agitation, he feared more than\nonce that he had betrayed himself; while to her such confrontations\nwere one long torment.\nThe nun had somewhat improved in health and was now living in the\nCapital. He had enquired where she was lodging and sent messages from\ntime to time, receiving (which indeed was all he expected) as little\nencouragement as before. In the last months his longing for the child\nhad increased rather than diminished, but day after day went by\nwithout his finding any means to change the situation. As the\nautumn drew to its close, he fell into a state of great despondency.\nOne fine moonlit night when he had decided, against his own\ninclination, to pay a certain secret visit,[7] a shower came on. As he\nhad started from the Palace and the place to which he was going was in\nthe suburbs of the Sixth Ward, it occurred to him that it would be\ndisagreeable to go so far in the rain. He was considering what he\nshould do when he noticed a tumbled-down house surrounded by very\nancient trees. He asked whose this gloomy and desolate mansion might\nbe, and Koremitsu, who, as usual, was with him replied: 'Why that is\nthe late Azechi no Dainagon's house. A day or two ago I took occasion",

'said Genji deeply concerned; 'I should have called at\nonce to convey my sympathy to her household. Pray go in at once and\nask for news.' Koremitsu accordingly sent one of the lesser attendants\nto the house, instructing him to give the impression that Genji had\ncome on purpose to enquire. When the man announced that Prince Genji\nhad sent him for news and was himself waiting outside, great\nexcitement and consternation prevailed in the house. Their mistress,\nthe servants said, had for several days been lying in a very parlous\ncondition and could not possibly receive a visit. But they dared not\nsimply send so distinguished a visitor away, and hastily tidying the\nsouthern parlour, they bustled him into it, saying, 'You must forgive\nus for showing you into this untidy room. We have done our best to\nmake it presentable. Perhaps, on a surprise visit, you will forgive us\nfor conducting you to such an out-of-the-way closet....' It was indeed\nnot at all the kind of room that he was used to. 'I have been\nmeaning for a long while to visit this house,' said Genji; 'but time\nafter time the proposals which I made in writing concerning a certain\nproject of mine were summarily rejected and this discouraged me. Had I\nbut known that your mistress's health had taken this turn for the\nworse....' 'Tell him that at this moment my mind is clear, though it\nmay soon be darkened again. I am deeply sensible of the kindness he\nhas shown in thus visiting my death-bed, and regret that I cannot\nspeak with him face to face. Tell him that if by any chance he has not\naltered his mind with regard to the matter that he has discussed with\nme before, by all means let him, when the time has come, number her\namong the ladies of his household. It is with great anxiety that I\nleave her behind me and I fear that such a bond with earth may hinder\nme from reaching the life for which I have prayed.'\nHer room was so near and the partition so thin that as she gave\nSh\u014dnagon her message he could hear now and again the sound of her sad,\nquavering voice. Presently he heard her saying to someone 'How kind,\nhow very kind of him to come. If only the child were old enough to\nthank him nicely!' 'It is indeed no question of kindness,' said Genji\nto Sh\u014dnagon. 'Surely it is evident that only some very deep feeling\nwould have driven me to display so zealous a persistency! Since first\nI saw this child, a feeling of strange tenderness towards her\npossessed me, and it has grown to such a love as cannot be of this\nworld only.[8] Though it is but an idle fancy, I have a longing to\nhear her voice. Could you not send for her before I go?' 'Poor little\nthing,' said Sh\u014dnagon. 'She is fast asleep in her room and knows\nnothing of all our troubles.' But as she spoke there was a sound of\nsomeone moving in the women's quarters and a voice suddenly was heard\nsaying: 'Grandmother, Grandmother! Prince Genji who came to see\nus in the mountains is here, paying a visit. Why do you not let him\ncome and talk to you?' 'Hush, child, hush!' cried all the gentlewomen,\nscandalized. 'No, no,' said the child; 'Grandmother said that when she\nsaw this prince it made her feel better at once. I was not being silly\nat all.' This speech delighted Genji; but the gentlewomen of the\nhousehold thought the child's incursion painful and unseemly, and\npretended not to hear her last remark. Genji gave up the idea of\npaying a real visit and drove back to his house, thinking as he went\nthat her behaviour was indeed still that of a mere infant. Yet how\neasy and delightful it would be to teach her!\nNext day he paid a proper visit. On his arrival he sent in a poem\nwritten on his usual tiny slip of paper: 'Since first I heard the\nvoice of the young crane, my boat shows a strange tendency to stick\namong the reeds!' It was meant for the little girl and was written in\na large, childish hand, but very beautifully, so that the ladies of\nthe house said as soon as they saw it 'This will have to go into the\nchild's copy-book.'\nSh\u014dnagon sent him the following note: 'My mistress, feeling that she\nmight not live through the day, asked us to have her moved to the\ntemple in the hills, and she is already on her way. I shall see to it\nthat she learns of your enquiry, if I can but send word to her before\nit is too late.' The letter touched him deeply.\nDuring these autumn evenings his heart was in a continual ferment. But\nthough all his thoughts were occupied in a different quarter, yet\nowing to the curious relationship in which the child stood to the\nbeing who thus obsessed his mind, the desire to make the girl his own\nthroughout this stormy time grew daily stronger. He remembered the\nevening when he had first seen her and the nun's poem, 'Not\nknowing if any will come to nurture the tender leaf....' She would\nalways be delightful; but in some respects she might not fulfil her\nearly promise. One must take risks. And he made the poem: 'When shall\nI see it lying in my hand, the young grass of the moor-side that\nsprings from purple[9] roots?' In the tenth month the Emperor was to\nvisit the Suzaku-in for the Festival of Red Leaves. The dancers were\nall to be sons of the noblest houses. The most accomplished among the\nprinces, courtiers and other great gentlemen had been chosen for their\nparts by the Emperor himself, and from the Royal Princes and State\nMinisters downward everyone was busy with continual practices and\nrehearsals. Genji suddenly realized that for a long while he had not\nenquired after his friends on the mountain. He at once sent a special\nmessenger who brought back this letter from the priest: 'The end came\non the twentieth day of last month. It is the common lot of mankind;\nyet her loss is very grievous to me!' This and more he wrote, and\nGenji, reading the letter was filled with a bitter sense of life's\nbriefness and futility. And what of the child concerning whose future\nthe dead woman had shown such anxiety? He could not remember his own\nmother's death at all distinctly; but some dim recollection still\nfloated in his mind and gave to his letter of condolence an added\nwarmth of feeling. It was answered, not without a certain\nself-importance, by the nurse Sh\u014dnagon.\nAfter the funeral and mourning were over, the child was brought back\nto the Capital. Hearing of this he allowed a short while to elapse and\nthen one fine, still night went to the house of his own accord. This\ngloomy, decaying, half-deserted mansion must, he thought, have a most\ndepressing effect upon the child who lived there. He was shown\ninto the same small room as before. Here Sh\u014dnagon told him between her\nsobs the whole tale of their bereavement, at which he too found\nhimself strangely moved. 'I would send my little mistress to His\nHighness her father's,' she continued, 'did I not remember how cruelly\nher poor mother was used in that house. And I would do it still if my\nlittle lady were a child in arms who would not know where she had been\ntaken to nor what the people there were feeling towards her. But she\nis now too big a girl to go among a lot of strange children who might\nnot treat her kindly. So her poor dead grandmother was always saying\ndown to her last day. You, Sir, have been very good to us, and it\nwould be a great weight off my mind to know that she was coming to you\neven if it were only for a little while; and I would not worry you\nwith asking what was to become of her afterwards. Only for her sake I\nam sorry indeed that she is not some years older, so that you might\nmake a match of it. But the way she has been brought up has made her\nyoung even for her age.' 'You need not so constantly remind me of her\nchildishness,' said Genji. 'Though it is indeed her youth and\nhelplessness which move my compassion, yet I realize (and why should I\nhide it from myself or from you?) that a far closer bond unites our\nsouls. Let me tell her myself what we have just now decided,' and he\nrecited a poem in which he asked if 'like the waves that lap the shore\nwhere young reeds grow he must advance only to recede again.' 'Will\nshe be too much surprised?' he added. Sh\u014dnagon, saying that the little\ngirl should by all means be fetched, answered his poem with another in\nwhich she warned him that he must not expect her to 'drift\nseaweed-like with the waves,' before she understood his intention.\n'Now, what made you think I should send you away without letting her\nsee you?' she asked, speaking in an off-hand, familiar tone which he\nfound it easy to pardon. His appearance, which the gentlewomen of\nthe house studied with great care while he sat waiting for the child\nand singing to himself a verse of the song _Why so hard to cross the\nhill?_ made a deep impression upon them, and they did not forget that\nmoment for a long while after.\nThe child was lying on her bed weeping for her grandmother. 'A\ngentleman in a big cloak has come to play with you,' said one of the\nwomen who were waiting upon her; 'I wonder if it is your father.' At\nthis she jumped up and cried out: 'Nurse, where is the gentleman in a\ncloak? Is he my father?' and she came running into the room. 'No,'\nsaid Genji, 'it is not your father; but it is someone else who wants\nyou to be very fond of him. Come....' She had learnt from the way\npeople talked about him that Prince Genji was someone very important,\nand feeling that he must really be very angry with her for speaking of\nhim as the 'gentleman in a cloak' she went straight to her nurse and\nwhispered 'Please, I am sleepy.' 'You must not be shy of me any more,'\nsaid Genji. 'If you are sleepy, come here and lie on my knee. Will you\nnot even come and talk to me?' 'There,' said Sh\u014dnagon, 'you see what a\nlittle savage she is,' and pushed the child towards him. She stood\nlistlessly by his side, passing her hand under her hair so that it\nfell in waves over her soft dress or clasping a great bunch of it\nwhere it stuck out thick around her shoulders. Presently he took her\nhand in his; but at once, in terror of this close contact with someone\nto whom she was not used, she cried out 'I said I wanted to go to\nbed,' and snatching her hand away she ran into the women's quarters.\nHe followed her crying 'Dear one, do not run away from me! Now that\nyour granny is gone, you must love me instead.' 'Well!' gasped\nSh\u014dnagon, deeply shocked. 'No, that is too much! How can you bring\nyourself to say such a wicked thing to the poor child? And it is\nnot much use _telling_ people to be fond of one, is it?' 'For the\nmoment, it may not be,' said Genji. 'But you will see that strange\nthings happen if one's heart is set upon a thing as mine is now.'\nHail was falling. It was a wild and terrible night. The thought of\nleaving her to pass it in this gloomy and half-deserted mansion\nimmeasurably depressed him and snatching at this excuse for remaining\nnear her: 'Shut the partition-door!' he cried. 'I will stay for a\nwhile and play the watchman here on this terrible night. Draw near to\nme, all of you!' and so saying, as though it were the most natural\nthing in the world, he picked up the child in his arms and carried her\nto her bed. The gentlewomen were far too astonished and confounded to\nbudge from their seats; while Sh\u014dnagon, though his high-handed\nproceedings greatly agitated and alarmed her, had to confess to\nherself that there was no real reason to interfere, and could only sit\nmoaning in her corner. The little girl was at first terribly\nfrightened. She did not know what he was going to do with her and\nshuddered violently. Even the feel of his delicate, cool skin when he\ndrew her to him, gave her goose-flesh. He saw this; but none the less\nhe began gently and carefully to remove her outer garments, and laid\nher down. Then, though he knew quite well that she was still\nfrightened of him, he began talking to her softly and tenderly: 'How\nwould you like to come with me one day to a place where there are lots\nof lovely pictures and dolls and toys?' And he went on to speak so\nfeelingly of all the things she was most interested in that soon she\nfelt almost at home with him. But for a long while she was restless\nand did not go properly to sleep. The storm still raged. 'Whatever\nshould we have done if this gentleman had not been here,' whispered\none of the women; 'I know that for my part I should have been in\na terrible fright. If only our little lady were nearer to his age!'\nSh\u014dnagon, still mistrustful, sat quite close to Genji all the while.\nAt last the wind began to drop. The night was far spent; but his\nreturn at such an hour would cause no surprise! 'She has become so\ndear to me,' said Genji, 'that, above all at this sad time in her\nlife, I am loath to leave her even for a few short hours. I think I\nshall put her somewhere where I can see her whenever I wish. I wonder\nthat she is not frightened to live in such a place as this.' 'I think\nher father spoke of coming to fetch her,' said Sh\u014dnagon; 'but that is\nnot likely to be till the Forty-nine Days are up.' 'It would of course\nunder ordinary circumstances be natural that her father should look\nafter her,' admitted Genji; 'but as she has been brought up entirely\nby someone else she has no more reason to care for him than for me.\nAnd though I have known her so short a time, I am certainly far fonder\nof her than her father can possibly be.' So saying he stroked the\nchild's hair and then reluctantly, with many backward glances, left\nthe room. There was now a heavy white fog, and hoar-frost lay thick on\nthe grass. Suddenly he found himself wishing that it were a real\nlove-affair, and he became very depressed. It occurred to him that on\nhis way home he would pass by a certain house which he had once\nfamiliarly frequented. He knocked at the door, but no one answered. He\nthen ordered one of his servants who had a strong voice to recite the\nfollowing lines: 'By my Sister's gate though morning fog makes all the\nworld still dark as night, I could not fail to pause.' When this had\nbeen sung twice, the lady sent an impertinent coxcomb of a valet to\nthe door, who having recited the poem 'If you disliked the hedge of\nfog that lies about this place, a gate of crazy wicker would not keep\nyou standing in the street,' at once went back again into the\nhouse. He waited; but no one else came to the door, and though he was\nin no mood to go dully home since it was now broad daylight, what else\ncould be done? At his palace he lay for a long while smiling to\nhimself with pleasure as he recollected the child's pretty speeches\nand ways. Towards noon he rose and began to write a letter to her; but\nhe could not find the right words, and after many times laying his\nbrush aside he determined at last to send her some nice pictures\ninstead.\nThat day Prince Hy\u014dbuky\u014d paid his long-promised visit to the late\nnun's house. The place seemed to him even more ruinous, vast and\nantiquated than he remembered it years ago. How depressing it must be\nfor a handful of persons to live in these decaying halls, and looking\nabout him he said to the nurse: 'No child ought to live in a place\nlike this even for a little while. I must take her away at once; there\nis plenty of room in my house. You' (turning to Sh\u014dnagon) 'shall be\nfound a place as a Lady-in-Waiting there. The child will be very well\noff, for there are several other young people for her to play with.'\nHe called the little girl to him and noticing the rich perfume that\nclung to her dress since Genji held her in his arms, the Prince said\n'How nicely your dress is scented. But isn't it rather drab?' No\nsooner had he said this than he remembered that she was in mourning,\nand felt slightly uncomfortable. 'I used sometimes to tell her\ngrandmother,' he continued, 'that she ought to let her come to see me\nand get used to our ways; for indeed it was a strange upbringing for\nher to live alone year in year out with one whose health and spirits\nsteadily declined. But she for some reason was very unfriendly towards\nme, and there was in another quarter[10] too a reluctance which I fear\neven at such a time as this may not be wholly overcome....' 'If that is\nso,' said Sh\u014dnagon, 'dull as it is for her here, I do not think\nshe should be moved till she is a little better able to shift for\nherself.'\nFor days on end the child had been in a terrible state of grief, and\nnot having eaten the least bite of anything she was grown very thin,\nbut was none the less lovely for that. He looked at her tenderly and\nsaid: 'You must not cry any more now. When people die, there is no\nhelp for it and we must bear it bravely. But now all is well, for I\nhave come instead....' But it was getting late and he could not stay\nany longer. As he turned to go he saw that the child, by no means\nconsoled at the prospect of falling under his care, was again crying\nbitterly. The Prince, himself shedding a few tears did his best to\ncomfort her: 'Do not grieve so,' he said, 'to-day or to-morrow I will\nsend for you to come and live with me,' and with that he departed.\nStill the child wept and no way could be found to distract her\nthoughts. It was not of course that she had any anxiety about her own\nfuture, for about such matters she had not yet begun to think at all;\nbut only that she had lost the companion from whom for years on end\nshe had never for a moment been separated. Young as she was, she\nsuffered so cruelly that all her usual games were quite abandoned, and\nthough sometimes during the day her spirits would a little improve, as\nnight drew on she became so melancholy that Sh\u014dnagon began to wonder\nhow much longer things would go on like this, and in despair at not\nbeing able to comfort her, would herself burst into tears.\nPresently Koremitsu arrived with a message saying that Genji had\nintended to visit them, but owing to a sudden command from the Palace\nwas unable to do so, and being very much perturbed at the little one's\ngrievous condition had sent for further news. Having delivered this\nmessage Koremitsu brought in some of Genji's servants whom he had\nsent to mount guard over the house that night. 'This kindness is\nindeed ill-placed,' said Sh\u014dnagon. 'It may not seem to him of much\nconsequence that his gentlemen should be installed here; but if the\nchild's father hears of it, we servants shall get all the blame for\nthe little lady's being given away to a married gentleman. It was you\nwho let it all begin, we shall be told. Now be careful,' she said\nturning to her fellow-servants, 'do not let her even mention these\nwatchmen to her father.' But alas, the child was quite incapable of\nunderstanding such a prohibition, and Sh\u014dnagon, after pouring out many\nlamentations to Koremitsu, continued: 'I do not doubt but that in due\ntime she will somehow become his wife, for so their fate seems to\ndecree. But now and for a long while there can be no talk of any such\nthing, and this, as he has roundly told me, he knows as well as the\nrest of us. So what he is after I cannot for the life of me imagine.\nOnly to-day when Prince Hy\u014dbuky\u014d was here he bade me keep a sharp eye\nupon her and not let her be treated with any indiscretion. I confess\nwhen he said it I remembered with vexation certain liberties which I\nhave allowed your master to take, thinking little enough of them at\nthe time.' No sooner had she said this than she began to fear that\nKoremitsu would put a worse construction on her words than she\nintended, and shaking her head very dolefully she relapsed into\nsilence. Nor was she far wrong, for Koremitsu was indeed wondering of\nwhat sort Genji's misdemeanours could have been.\nOn hearing Koremitsu's report Genji's heart was filled with pity for\nthe child's state and he would like to have gone to her at once. But\nhe feared that ignorant people would misunderstand these frequent\nvisits and, thinking the girl older than she was, spread foolish\nscandals abroad. It would be far simpler to fetch her to his\nPalace and keep her there. All through the day he sent numerous\nletters, and at dusk Koremitsu again went to the house saying that\nurgent business had once more prevented Genji from visiting them, for\nwhich remissness he tendered his apologies. Sh\u014dnagon answered curtly\nthat the girl's father had suddenly decided to fetch her away next day\nand that they were too busy to receive visits: 'The servants are all\nin a fluster at leaving this shabby old house where they have lived so\nlong and going to a strange, grand place....' She answered his further\nquestions so briefly and seemed so intent upon her sewing, that\nKoremitsu went away.\nGenji was at the Great Hall, but as usual he had been unable to get a\nword out of Aoi and in a gloomy mood he was plucking at his zithern\nand singing 'Why sped you across field and hill So fast upon this\nrainy night?'[11]\nThe words of the song were aimed at Aoi and he sang them with much\nfeeling. He was thus employed when Koremitsu arrived at the Great\nHall. Genji sent for him at once and bade him tell his story.\nKoremitsu's news was very disquieting. Once she was in her father's\npalace it would look very odd that Genji should fetch her away, even\nif she came willingly. It would inevitably be rumoured abroad that he\nhad made off with her like a child-snatcher, a thief. Far better to\nanticipate his rival and exacting a promise of silence from the people\nabout her, carry her off to his own palace immediately. 'I shall go\nthere at daybreak,' he said to Koremitsu; 'Order the carriage that I\ncame here in, it can be used just as it is, and see to it that one or\ntwo attendants are ready to go with me.' Koremitsu bowed and retired.\nGenji knew that whichever course he chose, there was bound to be\na scandal so soon as the thing became known. Inevitably gossips would\nspread the report that, young though she was, the child by this time\nknew well enough why she had been invited to live with Prince Genji in\nhis palace. Let them draw their own conclusions. That did not matter.\nThere was a much worse possibility. What if Hy\u014dbuky\u014d found out where\nshe was? His conduct in abducting another man's child would appear in\nthe highest degree outrageous and discreditable. He was sorely\npuzzled, but he knew that if he let this opportunity slip he would\nafterwards bitterly repent it, and long before daybreak he started on\nhis way. Aoi was cold and sullen as ever. 'I have just remembered\nsomething very important which I must see about at home,' he said; 'I\nshall not be away long,' and he slipped out so quietly that the\nservants of the house did not know that he was gone. His cloak was\nbrought to him from his own apartments and he drove off attended only\nby Koremitsu who followed on horseback. After much knocking they\nsucceeded in getting the gate opened, but by a servant who was not in\nthe secret. Koremitsu ordered the man to pull in Genji's carriage as\nquietly as he could and himself went straight to the front door, which\nhe rattled, coughing as he did so that Sh\u014dnagon might know who was\nthere. 'My lord is waiting,' he said when she came to the door. 'But\nthe young lady is fast asleep,' said Sh\u014dnagon; 'his Highness has no\nbusiness to be up and about at this time of night.' She said this\nthinking that he was returning from some nocturnal escapade and had\nonly called there in passing. 'I hear,' said Genji now coming forward,\n'that the child is to be moved to her father's and I have something of\nimportance which I must say to her before she goes.' 'Whatever\nbusiness you have to transact with her, I am sure she will give the\nmatter her closest attention,' scoffed Sh\u014dnagon. Matters of\nimportance indeed, with a child of ten! Genji entered the women's\nquarters. 'You cannot go in there,' cried Sh\u014dnagon in horror; 'several\naged ladies are lying all undressed....' 'They are all fast asleep,'\nsaid Genji. 'See, I am only rousing the child,' and bending over her:\n'The morning mist is rising,' he cried, 'it is time to wake!' And\nbefore Sh\u014dnagon had time to utter a sound, he had taken the child in\nhis arms and begun gently to rouse her. Still half-dreaming, she\nthought it was the prince her father who had come to fetch her. 'Come,'\nsaid Genji while he put her hair to rights, 'your father has sent me\nto bring you back with me to his palace.' For a moment she was dazed\nto find that it was not her father and shrank from him in fright.\n'Never mind whether it is your father or I,' he cried; 'it is all the\nsame,' and so saying he picked her up in his arms and carried her out\nof the inner room. 'Well!' cried out Koremitsu and Sh\u014dnagon in\nastonishment. What would he do next? 'It seems,' said Genji, 'that you\nwere disquieted at my telling you I could not visit her here as often\nas I wished and would make arrangements for her to go to a more\nconvenient place. I hear that you are sending her where it will be\neven more difficult for me to see her. Therefore ... make ready one or\nthe other of you to come with me.'\nSh\u014dnagon, who now realized that he was going to make off with the\nchild, fell into a terrible fluster. 'O Sir,' she said, 'you could not\nhave chosen a worse time. To-day her father is coming to fetch her,",

But by acting so hastily you will do\nyourself no good and leave the poor servants here in a sad pickle.'\n'If that is all,' cried Genji, 'let them follow as soon as they\nchoose,' and to Sh\u014dnagon's despair he had the carriage brought in. The\nchild stood by weeping and bewildered. There seemed no way of\npreventing him from carrying out his purpose and gathering together\nthe child's clothes that she had been sewing the night before, the\nnurse put on her own best dress and stepped into the carriage. Genji's\nhouse was not far off and they arrived before daylight. They drew up\nin front of the western wing and Genji alighted. Taking the child\nlightly in his arms he set her on the ground. Sh\u014dnagon, to whom these\nstrange events seemed like a dream, hesitated as though still\nuncertain whether she should enter the house or no. 'There is no need\nfor you to come in if you do not want to,' said Genji. 'Now that the\nchild herself is safely here I am quite content. If you had rather go\nback, you have only to say so and I will escort you.'\nReluctantly she left the carriage. The suddenness of the move was in\nitself enough to have upset her; but she was also worrying about what\nPrince Hy\u014dbuky\u014d would think when he found that his child had vanished.\nAnd indeed what _was_ going to become of her? One way or another all her\nmistresses seemed to be taken from her and it was only when she became\nfrightened of having wept for so long on end that she at last dried\nher eyes and began to pray.\nThe western wing had long been uninhabited and was not completely\nfurnished; but Koremitsu had soon fitted up screens and curtains where\nthey were required. For Genji makeshift quarters were soon contrived\nby letting down the side-wings of his screen-of-honour. He sent to the\nother part of the house for his night things and went to sleep. The\nchild, who had been put to bed not far off, was still very\napprehensive and ill at ease in these new surroundings. Her lips were\ntrembling, but she dared not cry out loud. 'I want to sleep with\nSh\u014dnagon,' she said at last in a tearful, babyish voice. 'You are\ngetting too big to sleep with a nurse,' said Genji, who had heard her.\n'You must try and go to sleep nicely where you are.' She felt\nvery lonely and lay weeping for a long while. The nurse was far too\nmuch upset to think of going to bed and sat up for the rest of the\nnight in the servants' quarters crying so bitterly that she was\nunconscious of all that went on around her.\nBut when it grew light she began to look about her a little. Not only\nthis great palace with its marvellous pillars and carvings, but the\nsand in the courtyard outside which seemed to her like a carpet of\njewels made so dazzling an impression upon her that at first she felt\nsomewhat overawed. However, the fact that she was now no longer in a\nhousehold of women gave her an agreeable sense of security.\nIt was the hour at which business brought various strangers to the\nhouse. There were several men walking just outside her window and she\nheard one of them whisper to another: 'They say that someone new has\ncome to live here. Who can it be, I wonder? A lady of note, I'll\nwarrant you.'\nBath water was brought from the other wing, and steamed rice for\nbreakfast. Genji did not rise till far on into the morning. 'It is not\ngood for the child to be alone,' he said to Sh\u014dnagon, 'so last night\nbefore I came to you I arranged for some little people to come and\nstay here,' and so saying he sent a servant to 'fetch the little girls\nfrom the eastern wing.' He had given special orders that they were to\nbe as small as possible and now four of the tiniest and prettiest\ncreatures imaginable arrived upon the scene.\nMurasaki was still asleep, lying wrapped in Genji's own coat. It was\nwith difficulty that he roused her. 'You must not be sad any more,' he\nsaid; 'If I were not very fond of you, should I be looking after you\nlike this? Little girls ought to be very gentle and obedient in their\nways.' And thus her education was begun.\nShe seemed to him, now that he could study her at leisure, even\nmore lovely than he had realized and they were soon engaged in an\naffectionate conversation. He sent for delightful pictures and toys to\nshow her and set to work to amuse her in every way he could. Gradually\nhe persuaded her to get up and look about her. In her shabby dress\nmade of some dark grey material she looked so charming now that she\nwas laughing and playing, with all her woes forgotten, that Genji too\nlaughed with pleasure as he watched her. When at last he retired to\nthe eastern wing, she went out of doors to look at the garden. As she\npicked her way among the trees and along the side of the lake, and\ngazed with delight upon the frosty flower-beds that glittered gay as a\npicture, while a many-coloured throng of unknown people passed\nconstantly in and out of the house, she began to think that this was a\nvery nice place indeed. Then she looked at the wonderful pictures that\nwere painted on all the panels and screens and quite lost her heart to\nthem.\nFor two or three days Genji did not go to the Palace, but spent all\nhis time amusing the little girl. Finally he drew all sorts of\npictures for her to put into her copy-book, showing them to her one by\none as he did so. She thought them the loveliest set of pictures she\nhad ever seen. Then he wrote part of the _Musashi-no_ poem.[12] She\nwas delighted by the way it was written in bold ink-strokes on a\nbackground stained with purple. In a smaller hand was the poem:\n'Though the parent-root[13] I cannot see, yet tenderly I love its\noff-shoot,[14]\u2014the dewy plant that grows upon Musashi Moor.' 'Come'\nsaid Genji while she was admiring it, 'you must write something too.'\n'I cannot write properly yet' she answered, looking up at him with a\nwitchery so wholly unconscious that Genji laughed. 'Even if you\ncannot write properly it will never do for us to let you off\naltogether. Let me give you a lesson.' With many timid glances towards\nhim she began to write. Even the childish manner in which she grasped\nthe brush gave him a thrill of delight which he was at a loss to\nexplain. 'Oh, I have spoiled it' she suddenly cried out and blushing\nhid from him what she had written. But he forced her to let him see it\nand found the poem: 'I do not know what put Musashi into your head and\nam very puzzled. What plant is it that you say is a relative of mine?'\nIt was written in a large childish hand which was indeed very\nundeveloped, but was nevertheless full of promise. It showed a strong\nresemblance to the late nun's writing. He felt certain that if she\nwere given up-to-date copy-books she would soon write very nicely.\nNext they built houses for the dolls and played so long at this game\ntogether that Genji forgot for a while the great anxiety[15] which was\nat that time preying upon his mind.\nThe servants who had been left behind at Murasaki's house were\nextremely embarrassed when Prince Hy\u014dbuky\u014d came to fetch her. Genji\nhad made them promise for a time at any rate to tell no one of what\nhad happened and Sh\u014dnagon had seemed to agree that this was best.\nAccordingly he could get nothing out of them save that Sh\u014dnagon had\ntaken the child away with her without saying anything about where she\nwas going. The Prince felt completely baffled. Perhaps the grandmother\nhad instilled into the nurse's mind the idea that things would not go\nsmoothly for the child at his palace. In that case the nurse with an\nexcess of craftiness might, instead of openly saying that she feared\nthe child would not be well treated under his roof, have thought it\nwiser to make off with her when opportunity offered. He went home\nvery depressed, asking them to let him know instantly if they had any\nnews, a request which again embarrassed them. He also made enquiries\nof the priest at the temple in the hills, but could learn nothing. She\nhad seemed to him to be a most lovable and delightful child; it was\nvery disappointing to lose sight of her in this manner. The princess\nhis wife had long ago got over her dislike of the child's mother and\nwas indignant at the idea that she was not to be trusted to do her\nduty by the child properly.\nGradually the servants from Murasaki's house assembled at her new\nhome. The little girls who had been brought to play with her were\ndelighted with their new companion and they were soon all playing\ntogether very happily.\nWhen her prince was away or busy, on dreary evenings she would still\nsometimes long for her grandmother the nun and cry a little. But she\nnever thought about her father whom she had never been used to see\nexcept at rare intervals. Now indeed she had 'a new father' of whom\nshe was growing every day more fond. When he came back from anywhere\nshe was the first to meet him and then wonderful games and\nconversations began, she sitting all the while on his lap without the\nleast shyness or restraint. A more charming companion could not have\nbeen imagined. It might be that when she grew older, she would not\nalways be so trustful. New aspects of her character might come into\nplay. If she suspected, for example, that he cared for someone else,\nshe might resent it, and in such a case all sorts of unexpected things\nare apt to happen; but for the present she was a delightful plaything.\nHad she really been his daughter, convention would not have allowed\nhim to go on much longer living with her on terms of such complete\nintimacy; but in a case like this he felt that such scruples were not",

She was not best pleased;\nbut just then even upon the busy Palace a springtime quiet seemed to\nhave settled, and being quite at leisure she consented to accompany\nhim.

'I\nam afraid,' said My\u014dbu, 'that it is not a very good night for\nlistening to music; sounds do not seem to carry very well.' But he\nwould not be thus put off. 'Go to her room' he said, 'and persuade her\nto play a few notes; it would be a pity if I went away without hearing\nher at all.' My\u014dbu felt somewhat shy of leaving him like this in her\nown little private room. She found the princess sitting by the window,\nher shutters not yet closed for the night; she was enjoying the scent\nof a blossoming plum-tree which stood in the garden just outside. It\ndid indeed seem just the right moment. 'I thought how lovely your\nzithern would sound on such a night as this,' she said, 'and could not\nresist coming to see you. I am always in such a hurry, going to and\nfrom the Palace, that do you know I have never had time to hear you\nplay. It is such a pity.' 'Music of this sort,' she replied, 'gives no\npleasure to those who have not studied it. What do they care for such\nmatters _who all day long run hither and thither in the City of a\nHundred Towers_?'[3] She sent for her zithern; but her heart beat fast.\nWhat impression would her playing make upon this girl? Timidly she\nsounded a few notes. The effect was very agreeable. True, she was not\na great performer; but the instrument was a particularly fine one and\nGenji found her playing by no means unpleasant to listen to.\nLiving in this lonely and half-ruined palace after such an upbringing\n(full no doubt of antiquated formalities and restrictions) as her\nfather was likely to have given her it would be strange indeed if her\nlife did not for the most part consist of memories and regrets. This\nwas just the sort of place which in an old tale would be chosen as the\nscene for the most romantic happenings. His imagination thus stirred,\nhe thought of sending her a message. But perhaps she would think this\nrather sudden. For some reason he felt shy, and hesitated.\n'It seems to be clouding over,' said the astute My\u014dbu, who knew that\nGenji would carry away a far deeper impression if he heard no more for\nthe present. 'Someone was coming to see me' she continued; 'I must\nnot keep him waiting. Perhaps some other time when I am not in such a\nhurry.... Let me close your window for you,' and with that she\nrejoined Genji, giving the princess no encouragement to play any more.",

What would\nhe think if he could see you disguising yourself like this?' Genji\nlaughed. 'I am afraid,' he said as he left the room, 'that you are not\nquite the right person to denounce me. Those who think such conduct\nreprehensible in a man must find it even less excusable in a girl.'\nShe remembered that Genji had often been obliged to reproach her for\nher reckless flirtations, and blushing made no reply.\nStill hoping to catch a glimpse of the zithern-player he crept softly\ntowards her window. He was about to hide at a point where the\nbamboo-fence was somewhat broken down when he perceived that a man was\nalready ensconced there. Who could it be? No doubt it was one of the\nprincess's lovers and he stepped back to conceal himself in the\ndarkness. The stranger followed him and turned out to be no other than\nT\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d.

But the prince, not knowing who the\nstranger was and frightened of being recognized, stole on tip-toe into\nthe shadow. Ch\u016bj\u014d suddenly accosted him: 'Though you shook me off so\nuncivilly, I thought it my duty to keep an eye on you' he said, and\nrecited the poem: 'Though together we left the great Palace hill, your\nsetting-place you would not show me, Moon of the sixteenth night!'\nThus he remonstrated; and Genji, though at first he had been somewhat\nput out by finding that he was not alone, when he recognized T\u014d no\nCh\u016bj\u014d could not help being rather amused.

He had quite decided that Genji had been courting\nher for months or even years, and thought impatiently that he for his\npart, if like Genji he were violently in love with a lady of this\nkind, would have been willing to risk a few reproaches or even\nthe loss of a little reputation. He could not however believe that his\nfriend intended to let the matter rest as it was much longer and\ndetermined to amuse himself by a little rivalry. From that time\nonwards both of them sent letters to the lady, but neither ever\nreceived any answer. This both vexed and puzzled them. What could be\nthe reason?

From this enigmatic reply Ch\u016bj\u014d deduced that Genji\nhad been in communication of some kind with the lady and he was\nslightly piqued by the fact that she had shown a preference between\nthem. Genji's deeper feelings were in no way involved, and though his\nvanity was a little wounded he would not have pursued the matter\nfarther had he not known the persuasive power of Ch\u016bj\u014d's style, and\nfeared that even now she might overcome her scruples and send him a",

He must see what My\u014dbu could be persuaded to\ndo. 'I cannot understand,' he said to her, 'why the princess should\nrefuse to take any notice of my letters. It is really very uncivil of\nher. I suppose she thinks I am a frivolous person who intends to amuse\nhimself a little in her company and then disappear. It is a strangely\nfalse conception of my character. As you know, my affections never\nalter, and if I have ever seemed to the world to be unfaithful it has\nalways been because in reality my suit had met with some unexpected\ndiscouragement. But this lady is so placed that no opposition from\nparents or brothers can interrupt our friendship, and if she will but\ntrust me she will find that her being alone in the world, so far from\nexposing her to callous treatment, makes her the more attractive.'\n'Come,' answered My\u014dbu, 'it will never do for you to run away with the\nidea that you can treat this great lady as a pleasant wayside\ndistraction; on the contrary she is extremely difficult of access and\nher rank has accustomed her to be treated with deference and\nceremony.' So spoke My\u014dbu, in accordance indeed with her own\nexperience of the princess. 'She has evidently no desire to be thought\nclever or dashing' said Genji; 'for some reason I imagine her as very\ngentle and forgiving.' He was thinking of Y\u016bgao when he said this.\nSoon after this he fell sick of his fever and after that was occupied\nby a matter of great secrecy; so that spring and summer had both\npassed away before he could again turn his attention to the lonely\nlady. But in the autumn came a time of quiet meditation and reflexion.\nAgain the sound of the cloth-beaters' mallets reached his ears,\ntormenting him with memories and longings. He wrote many letters to\nthe zithern-player, but with no more success than before. Her\nchurlishness exasperated him. More than ever he was determined not to\ngive in, and sending for My\u014dbu he scolded her for having been of\nso little assistance to him. 'What can be going on in the princess's\nmind?' he said; 'such strange behaviour I have never met with before.'\nIf he was piqued and surprised, My\u014dbu for her part was vexed that the\naffair had gone so badly. 'No one can say that you have done anything\nso very eccentric or indiscreet, and I do not think she feels so. If\nshe does not answer your letters it is only part of her general\nunwillingness to face the outer world.' 'But such a way of behaving is\npositively barbarous,' said Genji; 'if she were a girl in her 'teens\nand under the care of parents or guardians, such timidity might be\npardoned; but in an independent woman it is inconceivable. I would\nnever have written had I not taken it for granted that she had some\nexperience of the world. I was merely hoping that I had found someone\nwho in moments of idleness or depression would respond to me\nsympathetically. I did not address her in the language of gallantry,\nbut only begged for permission sometimes to converse with her in that\nstrange and lonely dwelling-place. But since she seems unable to\nunderstand what it is I am asking of her, we must see what can be done\nwithout waiting for her permission. If you will help me, you may be\nsure I shall not disgrace you in any way.'",

She sent\nfor him, and secretly as before he crept up to the palace. The moon\nwas just rising. He stood where the neglected bamboo-hedge grew\nsomewhat sparsely and watched. Persuaded by My\u014dbu the princess was\nalready at her zithern. So far as he could hear it at this\ndistance, he did not find the music displeasing; but My\u014dbu in her\nanxiety and confusion thought the tune very dull and wished it would\noccur to the princess to play something rather more up-to-date. The\nplace where Genji was waiting was well screened from view and he had\nno difficulty in creeping unobserved into the house. Here he called\nfor My\u014dbu, who pretending that the visit was a complete surprise to\nher said to the princess: 'I am so sorry, here is Prince Genji come to\nsee me. I am always getting into trouble with him for failing to\nsecure him your favour. I have really done my best, but you do not\nmake it possible for me to give him any encouragement, so now I\nimagine he has come to deal with the matter for himself. What am I to\nsay to him? I can answer for it that he will do nothing violent or\nrash. I think that considering all the trouble he has taken you might\nat least tell him that you will speak to him through a screen or\ncurtain.' The idea filled the princess with consternation. 'I should\nnot know what to say to him,' she wailed and as she said the words\nbolted towards the far side of the room with a bashfulness so\ninfantile that My\u014dbu could not help laughing. 'Indeed, Madam,' she\nsaid, 'it is childish of you to take the matter to heart in this way.\nIf you were an ordinary young lady under the eye of stern parents and\nbrothers, one could understand it; but for a person in your position\nto go on for ever being afraid to face the world is fantastic.' So\nMy\u014dbu admonished her and the princess, who could never think of any\nargument against doing what she was told to do, said at last: 'If I\nhave only to listen and need not say anything he may speak to me from\nbehind the lattice-door, so long as it is well locked.' 'I cannot ask\nhim to sit on the servant's bench,' said My\u014dbu. 'You really need not\nbe afraid that he will do anything violent or sudden.' Thus persuaded,\nthe princess went to a hatch which communicated between the\nwomen's quarters and the strangers' dais and firmly locking it with\nher own hand stuffed a mattress against it to make sure that no chink\nwas left unstopped. She was in such a terrible state of confusion that",

            "text": "she had not the least idea what she should say to her visitor, if she\nhad to speak to him, and had agreed to listen to him only because\nMy\u014dbu told her that she ought to.\nSeveral elderly serving-women of the wet-nurse type had been lying\nhalf-asleep in the inner room since dusk. There were however one or\ntwo younger maids who had heard a great deal about this Prince Genji\nand were ready to fall in love with him at a moment's notice. They now\nbrought out their lady's handsomest dress and persuaded her to let\nthem put her a little to rights; but she displayed no interest in\nthese preparations. My\u014dbu meanwhile was thinking how well Genji looked\nin the picturesque disguise which he had elaborated for use on these\nnight excursions and wished it were being employed in some quarter\nwhere it was more likely to be appreciated. Her only consolation was\nthat so mild a lady was not likely to make inordinate demands upon him\nor pester him with jealousies and exactions. On the other hand, she\nwas rather worried about the princess. 'What' thought My\u014dbu, 'if she\nshould fall in love with him and her heart be broken merely because I\nwas frightened of getting scolded?'\nRemembering her rank and upbringing, he was far from expecting her to\nbehave with the lively pertness of an up-to-date miss. She would be\nlangorous; yes, langorous and passionate. When, half-pushed by My\u014dbu,\nthe princess at last took her stand near the partition where she was\nto converse with her visitor, a delicious scent of sandal-wood[5]\ninvaded his nostrils, and this piece of coquetry at once raised\nhis hopes. He began to tell her with great earnestness and eloquence\nhow for almost a year she had continually occupied his thoughts. But\nnot a word did she answer; talking to her was no better than writing!\nIrritated beyond measure he recited the verse: 'If with a Vow of\nSilence thus ten times and again my combat I renew, 'tis that against\nme at least no sentence of muteness has been passed.' 'Speak at least\none word of dismissal,' he continued; 'do not leave me in this\nbewilderment.' There was among her ladies one called Jij\u016b, the\ndaughter of her old nurse. Being a girl of great liveliness and\nintelligence she could not bear to see her mistress cutting such a\nfigure as this and stepping to her side she answered with the poem:\n'The bell[6] had sounded and for a moment silence was imposed upon my\nlips. To have kept you waiting grieves me, and there let the matter\nrest.' She said the words in such a way that Genji was completely\ntaken in and thought it was the princess who had thus readily answered\nhis poem. He had not expected such smartness from an aristocratic lady\nof the old school; but the surprise was agreeable and he answered:\n'Madam, you have won the day,' adding the verse: 'Though well I know\nthat thoughts unspoken count more than thoughts expressed, yet\ndumb-crambo is not a cheering game to play.'\nHe went on to speak of one trifle or another as it occurred to him,\ndoing his very best to entertain her; but it was no use. Thinking at\nlast that silence might after all in this strange creature be merely a\nsign of deep emotion he could no longer restrain his curiosity and,\neasily pushing back the bolted door, entered the room. My\u014dbu, seeing\nwith consternation that he had falsified all her assurances, thought\nit better to know nothing of what followed and without turning her\nhead rushed away to her own apartments. Jij\u016b and the other\nladies-in-waiting had heard so much about Genji and were so anxious to\ncatch sight of him that they were more than ready to forgive his\nuncivil intrusion. Their only fear was that their mistress would be at\na loss how to deal with so unexpected a situation. He did indeed find\nher in the last extremity of bashfulness and embarrassment, but under\nthe circumstances that, thought Genji, was natural. Much was to be\nexplained by the strict seclusion in which she had been brought up. He\nmust be patient with her....\nAs his eyes grew used to the dim light he began to see that she was\nnot at all beautiful. Had she then not one quality at all to justify\nall these hopes and schemes? Apparently not one. It was late. What was\nthe use of staying? Bitterly disappointed he left the house. My\u014dbu,\nintensely curious to know what would happen, had lain awake listening.",

My\u014dbu had only the day before reproached him for using\nthe princess's palace as a 'wayside refuge.' To-day however he had no\ninclination whatever to halt there.\nWhen hour after hour went by and still no letter came My\u014dbu began to\nfeel very sorry for the princess whom she imagined to be suffering\nacutely from Genji's incivility. But in reality the poor lady was\nstill far too occupied with shame and horror at what had happened the\nnight before to think of anything else, and when late in the evening\nGenji's note at last arrived she could not understand in the least\nwhat it meant. It began with the poem: 'Scarce had the evening mist\nlifted and revealed the prospect to my sight when the night rain\nclosed gloomily about me.' 'I shall watch with impatience for a sign\nthat the clouds are breaking,' the letter continued. The ladies of the\nhousehold at once saw with consternation the meaning of this note:\nGenji did not intend ever to come again. But they were all agreed that\nan answer must be sent, and their mistress was for the time being in\nfar too overwrought a condition to put brush to paper; so Jij\u016b\n(pointing out that it was late and there was no time to be lost) again\ncame to the rescue: 'Give a thought to the country folk who wait for\nmoonlight on this cloudy night, though, while they gaze, so different\ntheir thoughts from yours!' This she dictated to her mistress\nwho, under the joint direction of all her ladies, wrote it upon a\npiece of paper which had once been purple but was now faded and\nshabby. Her writing was coarse and stiff, very mediocre in style, the\nupward and downward strokes being of the same thickness. Genji laid it\naside scarcely glancing at it; but he was very much worried by the\nsituation. How should he avoid hurting her feelings? Such an affair\nwas certain to get him into trouble of some kind. What was he to do?\nHe made up his mind that at all costs he must go on seeing her.\nMeanwhile, knowing nothing of this decision, the poor lady was very\nunhappy.\nThat night his father-in-law called for him on the way back from the\nPalace and carried him off to the Great Hall.\nHere in preparation for the coming festival all the young princes were\ngathered together, and during the days which followed everyone was\nbusy practising the songs or dances which had been assigned to him.\nNever had the Great Hall resounded with such a continual flow of\nmusic. The recorder and the big flute were all the while in full\nblast; and even the big drum was rolled out on to the verandah, the\nyounger princes amusing themselves by experimenting upon it. Genji was\nso busy that he had barely time to pay an occasional surreptitious\nvisit even to his dearest friends, and the autumn passed without his\nreturning to the Hitachi Palace. The princess could not make it out.",

It\nwas only a vague impression gathered in a room so dark that one could\nhardly see one's hand in front of one's face. If only he could\npersuade her to let him see her properly? But she seemed frightened to\nsubmit herself to the ordeal of daylight. Accordingly one night when\nhe knew that he should catch her household quite at its ease he crept\nin unobserved and peeped through a gap in the door of the women's\napartments. The princess herself was not visible. There was a very\ndilapidated screen-of-honour at the end of the room, but it looked as\nif it had not been moved from where it stood for years and years.\nFour or five elderly gentlewomen were in the room. They were preparing\ntheir mistress's supper in Chinese vessels which looked like the\nfamous 'royal blue' ware,[8] but they were much damaged and the food\nwhich had been provided seemed quite unworthy of these precious\ndishes. The old ladies soon retired, presumably to have their own\nsupper. In a closet opening out of the main road he could see a very\nchilly-looking lady in an incredibly smoke-stained white dress and\ndirty apron tied at the waist. Despite this shabbiness, her hair was\ndone over a comb in the manner of Court servants in ancient days when\nthey waited at their master's table, though it hung down untidily. He\nhad sometimes seen figures such as this haunting the housekeeper's\nrooms in the Palace, but he had no idea that they could still actually\nbe seen waiting upon a living person! 'O dear, O dear,' cried the lady\nin the apron, 'what a cold winter we are having! It was not worth\nliving so long only to meet times like these,' and she shed a tear.\n'If only things had but gone on as they were in the old Prince's\ntime!' she moaned. 'What a change! No discipline, no authority. To\nthink that I should have lived to see such days!' and she quivered\nwith horror like one who 'were he a bird would take wing and fly\naway.'[9] She went on to pour out such a pitiful tale of things gone\nawry that Genji could bear it no longer, and pretending that he had\njust arrived tapped at the partition-door. With many exclamations of\nsurprise the old lady brought a candle and let him in. Unfortunately\nJij\u016b had been chosen with other young persons to wait upon the Vestal\nVirgin and was not at home. Her absence made the house seem more\nrustic and old-fashioned than ever, and its oddity struck him even\nmore forcibly than before.\nThe melancholy snow was now falling faster and faster. Dark\nclouds hung in the sky, the wind blew fierce and wild. The big lamp\nhad burnt out and it seemed to be no one's business to light it. He\nremembered the terrible night upon which Y\u016bgao had been bewitched. The\nhouse indeed was almost as dilapidated. But it was not quite so large\nand was (to Genji's comfort) at least to some small degree inhabited.\nNevertheless it was a depressing place to spend the night at in such\nweather as this. Yet the snow-storm had a beauty and fascination of\nits own and it was tiresome that the lady whom he had come to visit\nwas far too stiff and awkward to join him in appreciating its\nwildness. The dawn was just breaking and lifting one of the shutters\nwith his own hand, he looked out at the snow-covered flower-beds.\nBeyond them stretched great fields of snow untrodden by any foot. The\nsight was very strange and lovely, and moved by the thought that he\nmust soon leave it: 'Come and look how beautiful it is out of doors,'\nhe cried to the princess who was in an inner room. 'It is unkind of\nyou always to treat me as though I were a stranger.' Although it was\nstill dark the light of the snow enabled the ancient gentlewomen who\nhad now returned to the room to see the freshness and beauty of\nGenji's face. Gazing at him with undisguised wonder and delight, they\ncried out to their mistress: 'Yes, madam, indeed you must come. You\nare not behaving as you should. A young lady should be all kindness\nand pretty ways.' Thus admonished, the princess who when told what to\ndo could never think of any reasons for not doing it, giving her\ncostume a touch here and there reluctantly crept into the front room.\nGenji pretended to be still looking out of the window, but presently\nhe managed to glance back into the room. His first impression was that\nher manner, had it been a little less diffident, would have been\nextremely pleasing. What an absurd mistake he had made. She was\ncertainly very tall as was shown by the length of her back when\nshe took her seat; he could hardly believe that such a back could\nbelong to a woman. A moment afterwards he suddenly became aware of her\nmain defect. It was her nose. He could not help looking at it. It\nreminded him of the trunk of Samantabhadra's[10] steed! Not only was\nit amazingly prominent, but (strangest of all) the tip which drooped\ndownwards a little was tinged with pink, contrasting in the oddest\nmanner with the rest of her complexion which was of a whiteness that\nwould have put snow to shame. Her forehead was unusually high, so that\naltogether (though this was partly concealed by the forward tilt of\nher head) her face must be hugely long. She was very thin, her bones\nshowing in the most painful manner, particularly her shoulder-bones\nwhich jutted out pitiably above her dress. He was sorry now that he\nhad exacted from her this distressing exhibition, but so extraordinary\na spectacle did she provide that he could not help continuing to gaze\nupon her. In one point at least she yielded nothing to the greatest\nbeauties of the Capital. Her hair was magnificent; she was wearing it\nloose and it hung a foot or more below the skirt of her gown. A\ncomplete description of people's costumes is apt to be tedious, but as\nin stories the first thing that is said about the characters is\ninvariably _what they wore_, I shall once in a way attempt such a\ndescription. Over a terribly faded bodice of imperial purple she wore\na gown of which the purple had turned definitely black with age. Her\nmantle was of sable-skins heavily perfumed with scent. Such a garment\nas this mantle was considered very smart several generations ago, but\nit struck him as the most extraordinary costume for a comparatively\nyoung girl. However as a matter of fact she looked as though without\nthis monstrous wrapping she would perish with cold and he could\nnot help feeling sorry for her. As usual she seemed quite devoid of\nconversation and her silence ended by depriving Genji also of the\npower of speech. He felt however that he must try again to conquer her\nreligious muteness and began making a string of casual remarks.\nOvercome with embarrassment she hid her face with her sleeve. This\nattitude, together with her costume, reminded him so forcibly of queer\npompous old officials whom he had sometimes seen walking at funeral\npace in state processions, hugging their emblems of office to their\nbreasts, that he could not help laughing. This he felt to be very\nrude. Really he was very sorry for her and longing to put a quick end\nto her embarrassment he rose to go. 'Till I began to look after you\nthere was no one in whom you could possibly have confided. But\nhenceforward I think you must make up your mind to be frank with me\nand tell me all your secrets. Your stern aloofness is very painful to\nme,' and he recited the verse: 'Already the icicle that hangs from the\neaves is melting in the rays of the morning sun. How comes it that\nthese drippings to new ice should turn?' At this she tittered\nslightly. Finding her inability to express herself quite unendurable\nhe left the house. Even in the dim light of early morning he noticed\nthat the courtyard gate at which his carriage awaited him was shaky on\nits posts and much askew; daylight, he was sure, would have revealed\nmany other signs of dilapidation and neglect. In all the desolate\nlandscape which stretched monotonously before him under the bleak\nlight of dawn only the thick mantle of snow which covered the\npine-trees gave a note of comfort and almost of warmth.\nSurely it was such a place as this, sombre as a little village in the\nhills, that his friends had thought of on that rainy night when they\nhad spoken of the gate 'deep buried in green thickets.' If only there\nwere really hidden behind _these_ walls some such exquisite\ncreature as they had imagined. How patiently, how tenderly he would\ncourt her! He longed for some experience which would bring him respite\nfrom the anguish with which a certain hopeless and illicit passion was\nat that time tormenting him. Alas, no one could have been less likely\nto bring him the longed-for distraction than the owner of this\nromantic mansion. Yet the very fact that she had nothing to recommend\nher made it impossible for him to give her up, for it was certain that\nno one else would ever take the trouble to visit her. But why, why had\nit fallen to him of all people to become her intimate? Had the spirit\nof the departed Prince Hitachi, unhappy at the girl's friendless\nplight, chosen him out and led him to her?\nAt the side of the road he noticed a little orange-tree almost buried\nin snow. He ordered one of his attendants to uncover it. As though\njealous of the attention that the man was paying to its neighbour a\npine-tree near by shook its heavily laden branches, pouring great\nbillows of snow over his sleeve. Delighted with the scene Genji\nsuddenly longed for some companion with whom he might share this\npleasure; not necessarily someone who loved such things as he did, but\none who at least responded to them in an ordinary way.\nThe gate through which his carriage had to pass in order to leave\nthe grounds was still locked. When at last the man who kept the key\nhad been discovered he turned out to be immensely old and feeble.\nWith him was a big, awkward girl who seemed to be his daughter or\ngrand-daughter. Her dress looked very grimy in contrast with the new\nsnow amid which she was standing. She seemed to be suffering very much\nfrom the cold, for she was hugging a little brazier of some kind with\na stick or two of charcoal burning none too brightly in it. The old\nman had not the strength to push back the door, and the girl was\ndragging at it as well. Taking pity on them one of Genji's\nservants went to their assistance and quickly opened it. Genji\nremembered the poem in which Po Ch\u00fc-i describes the sufferings of\nvillagers in wintry weather and he murmured the lines 'The little\nchildren run naked in the cold; the aged shiver for lack of winter\nclothes.' All at once he remembered the chilly appearance which that\nunhappy bloom had given to the princess's face and he could not help\nsmiling. If ever he were able to show her to T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d, what strange\ncomparison, he wondered, would Ch\u016bj\u014d use concerning it? He remembered\nhow Ch\u016bj\u014d had followed him on the first occasion. Had he continued to\ndo so? Perhaps even at this minute he was under observation. The\nthought irritated him.\nHad her defects been less striking he could not possibly have\ncontinued these distressing visits. But since he had actually seen her\nin all her tragic uncouthness pity gained the upper hand, and\nhenceforward he kept in constant touch with her and showed her every\nkindness. In the hope that she would abandon her sables he sent her\npresents of silk, satin and quilted stuffs. He also sent thick cloth",

She did not seem to have any objection\nto receiving these donations, which under the circumstances was very\nconvenient as it enabled him for the most part to limit their very\nsingular friendship to good offices of this kind.\nUtsusemi too, he remembered, had seemed to him far from handsome when\nhe had peeped at her on the evening of her sudden flight. But she at\nleast knew how to behave and that saved her plainness from being\nobtrusive. It was hard to believe that the princess belonged to a\nclass so far above that of Utsusemi. It only showed how little these\nthings have to do with birth or station. For in idle moments he\nstill regretted the loss of Utsusemi and it rankled in him yet that he\nhad in the end allowed her unyielding persistency to win the day.\nAnd so the year drew to its close. One day when he was at his\napartments in the Emperor's Palace, My\u014dbu came to see him. He liked to\nhave her to do his hair and do small commissions for him. He was not\nin the least in love with her; but they got on very well together and\nhe found her conversation so amusing that even when she had no duty to\nperform at the Palace he encouraged her to come and see him whenever\nshe had any news. 'Something so absurd has happened' she said, 'that I\ncan hardly bring myself to tell you about it ...,' and she paused\nsmiling. 'I can hardly think,' answered Genji, 'that there can be\nanything which you are frightened of telling to me.' 'If it were\nconnected with my own affairs,' she said, 'you know quite well that I\nshould tell you at once. But this is something quite different. I\nreally find it very hard to talk about.' For a long while he could get\nnothing out of her, and only after he had scolded her for making so\nunnecessary a fuss she at last handed him a letter. It was from the\nprincess. 'But this,' said Genji taking it, 'is the last thing in the\nworld that you could have any reason to hide from me.' She watched\nwith interest while he read it. It was written on thick paper drenched\nwith a strong perfume; the characters were bold and firm. With it was\na poem: 'Because of your hard heart, your hard heart only, the sleeves\nof this my Chinese dress are drenched with tears.' The poem must, he\nthought, refer to something not contained in the letter.\nHe was considering what this could be, when his eye fell on a clumsy,\nold-fashioned clothes-box wrapped in a painted canvas cover. 'Now'\nsaid My\u014dbu, 'perhaps you understand why I was feeling rather\nuncomfortable. You may not believe it, but the princess means you to\nwear this jacket on New Year's Day. I am afraid I cannot take it back\nto her; that would be too unkind. But if you like I will keep it for\nyou and no one else shall see it. Only please, since it was to you\nthat she sent, just have one look at it before it goes away.' 'But I\nshould hate it to go away,' said Genji; 'I think it was so kind of her\nto send it.' It was difficult to know what to say. Her poem was indeed\nthe most unpleasant jangle of syllables that he had ever encountered.\nHe now realized that the other poems must have been dictated to her,\nperhaps by Jij\u016b or one of the other ladies. And Jij\u016b too it must\nsurely be who held the princess's brush and acted as writing-master.\nWhen he considered what her utmost poetic endeavour would be likely to\nproduce he realized that these absurd verses were probably her\nmasterpiece and should be prized accordingly. He began to examine the\nparcel; My\u014dbu blushed while she watched him. It was a plain,\nold-fashioned, buff-coloured jacket of finely woven material, but\napparently not particularly well cut or stitched. It was indeed a\nstrange present, and spreading out her letter he wrote something\ncarelessly in the margin. When My\u014dbu looked over his shoulder she saw\nthat he had written the verse: 'How comes it that with my sleeve I\nbrushed this saffron-flower[11] that has no loveliness either of shape\nor hue?'\nWhat, wondered My\u014dbu, could be the meaning of this outburst against a\nflower? At last turning over in her mind the various occasions when\nGenji had visited the princess she remembered something[12] which she\nhad herself noticed one moonlit night, and though she felt the joke\nwas rather unkind, she could not help being amused. With practised\nease she threw out a verse in which she warned him that in the\neyes of a censorious world even this half-whimsical courtship might\nfatally damage his good name. Her impromptu poem was certainly faulty;\nbut Genji reflected that if the poor princess had even My\u014dbu's very\nordinary degree of alertness it would make things much easier; and it\nwas quite true that to tamper with a lady of such high rank was not\nvery safe.\nAt this point visitors began to arrive. 'Please put this somewhere out\nof sight,' said Genji pointing to the jacket; 'could one have believed\nthat it was possible to be presented with such an object?' and he\ngroaned. 'Oh why ever did I show it to him?' thought My\u014dbu. 'The only\nresult is that now he will be angry with me as well as with the\nprincess,' and in very low spirits she slipped out of his apartments.\nNext day she was in attendance upon the Emperor and while she was\nwaiting with other gentlewomen in the ladies' common-room Genji came\nup saying: 'Here you are. The answer to yesterday's letter. I am\nafraid it is rather far-fetched,' and he flung a note to her. The\ncuriosity of the other gentlewomen was violently aroused. Genji left\nthe room humming 'The Lady of Mikasa Hill,'[13] which naturally amused\nMy\u014dbu very much. The other ladies wanted to know why the prince was\nlaughing to himself. Was there some joke...? 'Oh, no,' said My\u014dbu; 'I\nthink it was only that he had noticed someone whose nose was a little\nred with the morning cold. The song he hummed was surely very\nappropriate.' 'I think it was very silly,' said one of the ladies.\n'There is no one here to-day with a red nose. He must be thinking of\nLady Sakon or Higo no Uneme.' They were completely mystified. When\nMy\u014dbu presented Genji's reply, the ladies of the Hitachi Palace\ngathered round her to admire it. It was written negligently on plain\nwhite paper but was none the less very elegant. 'Does your gift of a\ngarment mean that you wish a greater distance than ever to be kept\nbetween us?'[14]\nOn the evening of the last day of the year he sent back the box which\nhad contained his jacket, putting into it a court dress which had\nformerly been presented to him, a dress of woven stuff dyed\ngrape-colour and various stuffs of yellow-rose colour and the like.\nThe box was brought by My\u014dbu. The princess's ancient gentlewomen\nrealized that Genji did not approve of their mistress's taste in\ncolours and wished to give her a lesson. 'Yes,' they said grudgingly,\n'that's a fine deep red while its new, but just think how it will\nfade. And in Madam's poem too, I am sure, there was much more good\nsense. In his answer he only tries to be smart.' The princess shared\ntheir good opinion of her poem. It had cost her a great deal of effort\nand before she sent it she had been careful to copy it into her\nnote-book.\nThen came the New Year's Day celebrations; and this year there was\nalso to be the New Year's mumming, a band of young noblemen going\nround dancing and singing in various parts of the Palace. After the\nfestival of the White Horse on the seventh day Genji left the\nEmperor's presence at nightfall and went to his own apartments in the\nPalace as though intending to stay the night there. But later he\nadjourned to the Hitachi Palace which had on this occasion a less\nforbidding appearance than usual. Even the princess was rather more\nordinary and amenable. He was hoping that like the season she too had\nbegun anew, when he saw that sunlight was coming into the room. After\nhesitating for a while, he got up and went out into the front room. The\ndouble doors at the end of the eastern wing were wide open, and\nthe roof of the verandah having fallen in, the sunshine poured\nstraight into the house. A little snow was still falling and its\nbrightness made the morning light yet more exquisitely brilliant and\nsparkling. She watched a servant helping him into his cloak. She was\nlying half out of the bed, her head hanging a little downwards and her\nhair falling in great waves to the floor. Pleased with the sight he\nbegan to wonder whether she would not one day outgrow her plainness.\nHe began to close the door of the women's apartments, but suddenly\nfeeling that he owed her amends for the harsh opinion of her\nappearance which he had formed before, he did not quite shut the door,\nbut bringing a low stool towards it sat there putting his disordered\nhead-dress to rights. One of the maids brought him an incredibly\nbattered mirror-stand, Chinese combs, a box of toilet articles and\nother things. It amused him to discover that in this household of\nwomen a little male gear still survived, even in so decrepit a state.\nHe noticed that the princess, who was now up and dressed, was looking\nquite fashionable. She was in fact wearing the clothes which he had\nsent her before the New Year, but he did not at first recognize them.\nHe began however to have a vague idea that her mantle, with its rather\nconspicuous pattern, was very like one of the things he had given her.\n'I do hope,' he said presently, 'that this year you will be a little\nmore conversational. I await the day when you will unbend a little\ntowards me more eagerly than the poet longs for the first nightingale.\nIf only like the year that has changed you too would begin anew!' Her\nface brightened. She had thought of a remark and trembling from head\nto foot with a tremendous effort she brought out the quotation 'When\nplovers chirp and all things grow anew.' 'Splendid,' said Genji, 'This\nis a sign that the new year has indeed begun' and smiling\nencouragingly at her he left the house, she following him with her\neyes from the couch on which she lay. Her face as usual was half\ncovered by her arm; but the unfortunate flower still bloomed\nconspicuously. 'Poor thing, she really _is_ very ugly,' thought Genji\nin despair.",

In\naccordance with the wishes of her old-fashioned grandmother her teeth\nwere not blackened, but her eyebrows were delicately touched with\nstain. 'Why, when I might be playing with a beautiful child, do I\nspend my time with an ugly woman? 'Genji kept on asking himself in\nbewilderment while they sat together playing with her dolls. Next she\nbegan to draw pictures and colour them. After she had painted all\nsorts of queer and amusing things, 'Now I am going to do a picture for\nyou,' said Genji and drawing a lady with very long hair he put a dab\nof red on her nose. Even in a picture, he thought pausing to look at\nthe effect, it gave one a most uncomfortable feeling. He went and\nlooked at himself in the mirror and as though dissatisfied with his\nown fresh complexion he suddenly put on his own nose a dab of red such\nas he had given to the lady in the picture. He looked at himself in\nthe mirror. His handsome face had in an instant become ridiculous and\nrepulsive. At first the child laughed. 'Should you go on liking me if\nI were always as ugly as this?' he asked. Suddenly she began to be\nafraid that the paint would not come off. 'Oh why did you do it?' she\ncried. 'How horrible!' He pretended to rub it without effect. 'No,' he\nsaid ruefully, 'it will not come off. What a sad end to our game! I\nwonder what the Emperor will say when I go back to the Palace?'\nHe said it so seriously that she became very unhappy, and longing to\ncure him dipped a piece of thick soft paper in the water-jug which\nstood by his writing-things, and began scrubbing at his nose. 'Take\ncare,' he cried laughing, 'that you do not serve me as Heich\u016b[15] was\ntreated by his lady. I would rather have a red nose than a black one.'\nSo they passed their time, making the prettiest couple.\nIn the gentle spring sunshine the trees were already shimmering with a\nhaze of new-grown buds. Among them it was the plum-trees that gave the\nsurest promise, for already their blossoms were uncurling, like lips\nparted in a faint smile. Earliest of them all was a red plum that grew\nbeside the covered steps. It was in full colour. 'Though fair the tree\non which it blooms, this red flower fills me with a strange\nmisgiving,'[16] sang Genji with a deep sigh.\nWe shall see in the next chapter what happened in the end to all these\npeople.",

It was to be a more magnificent sight\nthis year than it had ever been before and the ladies of the Palace\nwere very disappointed that they could not be present.[1] The Emperor\ntoo could not bear that Fujitsubo should miss the spectacle, and he\ndecided to hold a grand rehearsal in the Palace. Prince Genji danced\nthe 'Waves of the Blue Sea.' T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d was his partner; but though\nboth in skill and beauty he far surpassed the common run of\nperformers, yet beside Genji he seemed like a mountain fir growing\nbeside a cherry-tree in bloom. There was a wonderful moment when the\nrays of the setting sun fell upon him and the music grew suddenly\nlouder. Never had the onlookers seen feet tread so delicately nor head\nso exquisitely poised; and in the song which follows the first\nmovement of the dance his voice was sweet as that of Kalavinka[2]\nwhose music is Buddha's Law. So moving and beautiful was this dance\nthat at the end of it the Emperor's eyes were wet, and all the princes\nand great gentlemen wept aloud. When the song was over and,\nstraightening his long dancer's sleeves, he stood waiting for the\nmusic to begin again and at last the more lively tune of the second\nmovement struck up,\u2014then indeed, with his flushed and eager face,\nhe merited more than ever his name of Genji the Shining One.

Then, noticing that she made no response, 'What did you\nthink of it?' 'Yes, it was very good,' she managed to say at last.\n'The partner did not seem to me bad either,' he went on; 'there is\nalways something about the way a gentleman moves and uses his hands\nwhich distinguishes his dancing from that of professionals. Some of\nour crack dancing-masters have certainly made very clever performers\nof their own children; but they never have the same freshness, the\nsame charm as the young people of our class. They expended so much\neffort on the rehearsal that I am afraid the festival itself may seem\na very poor affair. No doubt they took all this trouble because they\nknew that you were here at the rehearsal and would not see the real\nperformance.'\nNext morning she received a letter from Genji: 'What of the rehearsal?\nHow little the people who watched me knew of the turmoil that all\nthe while was seething in my brain!' And to this he added the\npoem: 'When sick with love I yet sprang to my feet and capered\nwith the rest, knew you what meant the fevered waving of my long\ndancing-sleeve?' Next he enjoined secrecy and prudence upon her, and\nso his letter ended. Her answer showed that despite her agitation she\nhad not been wholly insensible to what had fascinated all other eyes:\n'Though from far off a man of China waved his long dancing-sleeves,\nyet did his every motion fill my heart with wonder and delight.'\nTo receive such a letter from her was indeed a surprise. It charmed\nhim that her knowledge should extend even to the Court customs of a\nland beyond the sea. Already there was a regal note in her words. Yes,\nthat was the end to which she was destined. Smiling to himself with\npleasure he spread the letter out before him, grasping it tightly in\nboth hands as a priest holds the holy book, and gazed at it for a long",

After the music-boats had rowed round the lake\ndance upon dance was performed, both Korean and of the land beyond the\nsea. The whole valley resounded with the noise of music and drums. The\nEmperor insisted upon treating Genji's performance at the rehearsal as\na kind of miracle or religious portent, and ordered special services\nto be read in every temple. Most people thought this step quite\nreasonable; but Princess K\u014dkiden said crossly that she saw no\nnecessity for it. The Ring[5] was by the Emperor's order composed\nindifferently of commoners and noblemen chosen out of the whole realm\nfor their skill and grace. The two Masters of Ceremony, Sayemon no\nKami and Uyemon no Kami, were in charge of the left and right\nwings of the orchestra. Dancing-masters and others were entrusted with\nthe task of seeking out performers of unusual merit and training them\nfor the festival in their own houses. When at last under the red\nleafage of tall autumn trees forty men stood circle-wise with their\nflutes and to the music that they made a strong wind from the hills\nsweeping the pine-woods added its fierce harmonies, while from amid a\nwreckage of whirling and scattered leaves the Dance of the Blue Waves\nsuddenly broke out in all its glittering splendour,\u2014a rapture seized\nthe onlookers that was akin to fear.\nThe maple-wreath that Genji wore had suffered in the wind and thinking\nthat the few red leaves which clung to it had a desolate air the\nMinister of the Left[6] plucked a bunch of chrysanthemums from among\nthose that grew before the Emperor's seat and twined them in the\ndancer's wreath.\nAt sunset the sky clouded over and it looked like rain. But even the\nweather seemed conscious that such sights as this would not for a long\nwhile be seen again, and till all was over not a drop fell. His Exit\nDance, crowned as he was with this unspeakably beautiful wreath of\nmany coloured flowers, was even more astonishing than that wonderful\nmoment on the day of the rehearsal and seemed to the thrilled\nonlookers like the vision of another world. Humble and ignorant folk\nsitting afar on tree-roots or beneath some rock, or half-buried in\ndeep banks of fallen leaves\u2014few were so hardened that they did not\nshed a tear. Next came the 'Autumn Wind' danced by Lady J\u014dky\u014dden's\nson[7] who was still a mere child. The remaining performances\nattracted little attention, for the audience had had its fill of\nwonders and felt that whatever followed could but spoil the\nrecollection of what had gone before.\nThat night Genji was promoted to the First Class of the Third Rank and\nT\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d was promoted to intermediate standing between the First\nand Second Classes of the Fourth Rank. The gentlemen of the court were\nall promoted one rank. But though they celebrated their good fortune\nwith the usual rejoicings they were well aware that they had only been\ndragged in Genji's wake and wondered how it was that their destinies\nhad come to be linked in this curious way with those of the prince who\nhad brought them this unexpected piece of good fortune.",

Aoi heard a rumour of\nthis, but it reached her merely in the form that someone was living\nwith him at his palace and she did not know that it was a child. Under\nthese circumstances it was quite natural that she should feel much\naggrieved. But if only she had flown into an honest passion and abused\nhim for it as most people would have done, he would have told her\neverything and put matters right. As it was, she only redoubled her\nicy aloofness and thus led him to seek those very distractions of\nwhich it was intended as a rebuke. Not only was her beauty so flawless\nthat it could not fail to win his admiration, but also the mere fact\nthat he had known her since so long ago, before all the rest, made him\nfeel towards her a tenderness of which she seemed quite unaware. He\nwas convinced however that her nature was not at bottom narrow and\nvindictive, and this gave him some hope that she would one day relent.\nMeanwhile as he got to know little Murasaki better he became the more\ncontent both with her appearance and her character. She at least gave\nhim her whole heart. For the present he did not intend to reveal her\nidentity even to the servants in his own palace. She continued to\nuse the somewhat outlying western wing which had now been put into\nexcellent order, and here Genji constantly came to see her. He gave\nher all kinds of lessons, writing exercises for her to copy and\ntreating her in every way as though she were a little daughter who had\nbeen brought up by foster-parents, but had now come to live with him.\nHe chose her servants with great care and gave orders that they should\ndo everything in their power to make her comfortable; but no one\nexcept Koremitsu knew who the child was or how she came to be living\nthere.

When Genji was\nthere she forgot her sorrow; but in the evening he was very seldom at\nhome. She was sorry that he was so busy and when he hurried every\nevening to some strange place or other she missed him terribly; but\nshe was never angry with him. Sometimes for two or three days on end\nhe would be at the Palace or the Great Hall and when he returned he\nwould find her very tearful and depressed. Then he felt just as though\nhe were neglecting some child of his own, whose mother had died and\nleft it in his keeping, and for a while he grew uneasy about his night\nexcursions.\nThe priest was puzzled when he heard that Genji had taken Murasaki to\nlive with him, but saw no harm in it and was delighted that she should\nbe so well cared for. He was gratified too when Genji begged that the\nservices in the dead nun's memory should be celebrated with special\npomp and magnificence.\nWhen he went to Fujitsubo's palace, anxious to see for himself whether\nshe was keeping her health, he was met by a posse of waiting-women\n(My\u014dbus, Ch\u016bnagons, Nakatsukasas and the like) and Fujitsubo\nherself showed, to his great disappointment, no sign of appearing.\nThey gave a good account of her, which somewhat allayed his anxiety,\nand had passed on to general gossip when it was announced that Prince\nHy\u014dbuky\u014d[8] had arrived. Genji at once went out to speak to him. This\ntime Genji thought him extremely handsome and there was a softness, a\ncaressing quality in his manner (Genji was watching him more closely\nthan he knew) which was feminine enough to make his connection with\nFujitsubo and Murasaki at once uppermost in the mind of his observer.\nIt was, then, as the brother of the one and the father of the other\nthat the new-comer at once created a feeling of intimacy, and they had\na long conversation. Hy\u014dbuky\u014d could not fail to notice that Genji was\nsuddenly treating him with an affection which he had never displayed\nbefore. He was naturally very much gratified, not realizing that Genji\nhad now, in a sense, become his son-in-law. It was getting late and\nHy\u014dbuky\u014d was about to join his sister in another room. It was with\nbitterness that Genji remembered how long ago the Emperor had brought\nher to play with him. In those days he ran in and out of her room just\nas he chose; now he could not address her save in precarious messages.\nShe was as inaccessible, as remote as one person conceivably could be\nfrom another, and finding the situation intolerable, he said politely",

But if you ever\nfelt inclined to send for me, I should be delighted ...' and he\nhurried away.\n\u014cmy\u014dbu, the gentlewoman who had contrived Genji's meeting with\nFujitsubo, seeing her mistress relapse into a steady gloom and vexed\nat her belated caution was all the time doing her best to bring the\nlovers together again; but days and months went by and still all\nher efforts were in vain; while they, poor souls, strove desperately\nto put away from them this love that was a perpetual disaster.\nAt Genji's palace Sh\u014dnagon, the little girl's nurse, finding herself\nin a world of unimagined luxuries and amenities, could only attribute\nthis good fortune to the success of the late nun's prayers. The Lord\nBuddha to whose protection the dying lady had so fervently recommended\nher grand-daughter had indeed made handsome provision for her. There\nwere of course certain disadvantages. The haughtiness of Aoi was not\nonly in itself to be feared, but it seemed to have the consequence of\ndriving Prince Genji to seek distractions right and left, which would\nbe very unpleasant for the little princess so soon as she was old\nenough to realize it. Yet so strong a preference did he show for the\nchild's company that Sh\u014dnagon did not altogether lose heart.\nIt being then three months since her grandmother died Murasaki came\nout of mourning at the end of the Godless Month. But it was thought\nproper since she was to be brought up as an orphan that she should\nstill avoid patterned stuffs, and she wore a little tunic of plain\nred, brown or yellow, in which she nevertheless looked very smart and\ngay.\nHe came to have a look at her before going off to the New Year's Day\nreception at Court. 'From to-day onwards you are a grown-up lady,' he\nsaid, and as he stood smiling at her he looked so charming and\nfriendly that she could not bear him to go, and hoping that he would\nstay and play with her a little while longer she got out her toys.\nThere was a doll's kitchen only three feet high but fitted out with\nall the proper utensils, and a whole collection of little houses which\nGenji had made for her. Now she had got them all spread out over the\nfloor so that it was difficult to move without treading on them.\n'Little Inu broke them yesterday,' she explained 'when he was\npretending to drive out the Old Year's demons, and I am mending them.'\nShe was evidently in great trouble. 'What a tiresome child he is,'\nsaid Genji. 'I will get them mended for you. Come, you must not cry on\nNew Year's Day,' and he went out. Many of the servants had collected\nat the end of the corridor to see him starting out for the Court in\nall his splendour. Murasaki too went out and watched him. When she\ncame back she put a grand dress on one of her dolls and did a\nperformance with it which she called 'Prince Genji visiting the\nEmperor.' 'This year,' said Sh\u014dnagon, looking on with disapproval,\n'you must really try not to be such a baby. It is time little girls\nstopped playing with dolls when they are ten years old, and now that\nyou have got a kind gentleman wanting to be your husband you ought to\ntry and show him that you can behave like a nice little grown-up lady\nor he will get tired of waiting.' She said this because she thought\nthat it must be painful for Genji to see the child still so intent\nupon her games and be thus reminded that she was a mere baby. Her\nadmonishment had the effect of making Murasaki for the first time\naware that Genji was to be her husband. She knew all about husbands.\nMany of the maid-servants had them, but such ugly ones! She was very\nglad that hers was so much younger and handsomer. Nevertheless the\nmere fact that she thought about the matter at all showed that she was\nbeginning to grow up a little. Her childish ways and appearance were\nby no means so great a misfortune as Sh\u014dnagon supposed, for they went\na long way towards allaying the suspicions which the child's presence\nmight otherwise have aroused in Genji's somewhat puzzled household.\nWhen he returned from Court he went straight to the Great Hall. Aoi\nwas as perfect as ever, and just as unfriendly. This never failed to\nwound Genji. 'If only you had changed with the New Year, had\nbecome a little less cold and forbidding, how happy I should be!' he\nexclaimed. But she had heard that someone was living with him and had\nat once made up her mind that she herself had been utterly supplanted\nand put aside. Hence she was more sullen than ever; but he pretended\nnot to notice it and by his gaiety and gentleness at last induced\nher to answer when he spoke. Was it her being four years older\nthan him that made her seem so unapproachable, so exasperatingly\nwell-regulated? But that was not fair. What fault could he possibly\nfind in her? She was perfect in every respect and he realized that if\nshe was sometimes out of humour this was solely the result of his own\nirregularities. She was after all the daughter of a Minister, and of\nthe Minister who above all others enjoyed the greatest influence and\nesteem. She was the only child of the Emperor's sister and had been\nbrought up with a full sense of her own dignity and importance. The\nleast slight, the merest hint of disrespect came to her as a complete\nsurprise. To Genji all these pretensions naturally seemed somewhat\nexaggerated and his failure to make allowances for them increased her\nhostility.\nAoi's father was vexed by Genji's seeming fickleness, but so soon as\nhe was with him he forgot all his grievances and was always extremely\nnice to him. When Genji was leaving next day his father-in-law came to\nhis room and helped him to dress, bringing in his own hands a belt\nwhich was an heirloom famous far and wide. He pulled straight the back\nof Genji's robe which had become a little crumpled, and indeed short\nof bringing him his shoes performed in the friendliest way every\npossible small service. 'This,' said Genji handing back the belt, 'is\nfor Imperial banquets or other great occasions of that kind.' 'I have\nothers much more valuable,' said the Minister, 'which I will give you\nfor the Imperial banquets. This one is not of much account save\nthat the workmanship of it is rather unusual,' and despite Genji's\nprotests he insisted upon buckling it round him. The performance of\nsuch services was his principal interest in life. What did it matter\nif Genji was rather irregular in his visits? To have so agreeable a\nyoung man going in and out of one's house at all was the greatest\npleasure he could imagine.\nGenji did not pay many New Year's visits. First he went to the\nEmperor, then the Heir Apparent and the Ex-Emperor, and after that to\nPrincess Fujitsubo's house in the Third Ward. As they saw him enter\nthe servants of the house noticed how much he had grown and altered in\nthe last year. 'Look how he has filled out,' they said, 'even since\nhis last visit!' Of the Princess herself he was only allowed a distant\nglimpse. It gave him many forebodings. Her child had been expected in\nthe twelfth month and her condition was now causing some anxiety. That\nit would at any rate be born some time during the first weeks of the\nNew Year was confidently assumed by her own people and had been stated\nat Court. But the first month went by and still nothing happened. It\nbegan to be rumoured that she was suffering from some kind of\npossession or delusion. She herself grew very depressed; she felt\ncertain that when the event at last happened she would not survive it\nand she worried so much about herself that she became seriously ill.\nThe delay made Genji more certain than ever of his own responsibility\nand he arranged secretly for prayers on her behalf to be said in all\nthe great temples. He had already become firmly convinced that\nwhatever might happen concerning the child Fujitsubo was herself\nutterly doomed when he heard that about the tenth day of the second\nmonth she had successfully given birth to a boy. The news brought\ngreat satisfaction both to the Emperor and the whole court.\nThe Emperor's fervent prayers for her life and for that of a child\nwhich she knew was not his, distressed and embarrassed her; whereas,\nwhen the maliciously gloomy prognostications of K\u014dkiden and the rest\nwere brought to her notice, she was at once filled with a perverse\ndesire to disappoint their hopes and make them look ridiculous in the\neyes of those to whom they had confided their forebodings. By a great\neffort of will she threw off the despair which had been weighing down\nupon her and began little by little to recover her usual vigour.\nThe Emperor was impatient to see Fujitsubo's child and so too (though\nhe was forced to conceal his interest in the matter) was Genji\nhimself. Accordingly he went to her palace when there were not many\npeople about and sent in a note offering as the Emperor was in such a\nstate of impatience to see the child and etiquette forbade him to do\nso for several weeks, to look at the child himself and report upon its\nappearance to the Emperor. She replied that she would rather he saw it\non a day when it was less peevish; but in reality her refusal had\nnothing to do with the state of the child's temper; she could not bear\nthe idea of his seeing it at all. Already it bore an astonishing\nresemblance to him; of that she was convinced. Always there lurked in\nher heart the torturing demon of fear. Soon others would see the child\nand instantly know with absolute certainty the secret of her swift\ntransgression. What charity towards such a crime as this would a world\nhave that gossips if a single hair is awry? Such thoughts continually\ntormented her and she again became weary of her life.",

            "text": "From time to time he saw \u014cmy\u014dbu, but though he still implored her to\narrange a meeting none of his many arguments availed him. He also\npestered her with so many questions about the child that she exclaimed\nat last: 'Why do you go on plaguing me like this? You will be\nseeing him for yourself soon, when he is shown at Court.' But though\nshe spoke impatiently she knew quite well what he was suffering and\nfelt for him deeply. The matter was not one which he could discuss\nexcept with Fujitsubo herself, and it was impossible to see her. Would\nhe indeed ever again see her alone or communicate with her save\nthrough notes and messengers? And half-weeping with despair he recited\nthe verse: 'What guilty intercourse must ours have been in some life\nlong ago, that now so cruel a barrier should be set between us?'\n\u014cmy\u014dbu seeing that it cost her mistress a great struggle to do without\nhim was at pains not to dismiss him too unkindly and answered with the\nverse: 'Should you see the child my lady would be in torment; and\nbecause you have not seen it you are full of lamentations. Truly have\nchildren been called a black darkness that leads the parents' heart\nastray!' And coming closer she whispered to him 'Poor souls, it is a\nhard fate that has overtaken you both.' Thus many times and again he\nreturned to his house desperate. Fujitsubo meanwhile, fearing lest\nGenji's continual visits should attract notice, began to suspect that\n\u014cmy\u014dbu was secretly encouraging him and no longer felt the same\naffection for her. She did not want this to be noticed and tried to\ntreat her just as usual; but her irritation was bound sometimes to\nbetray itself and \u014cmy\u014dbu, feeling that her mistress was estranged from\nher and at a loss to find any reason for it, was very miserable.\nIt was not till its fourth month that the child was brought to the\nPalace. It was large for its age and had already begun to take a great\ninterest in what went on around it. Its extraordinary resemblance to\nGenji was not remarked upon by the Emperor who had an idea that\nhandsome children were all very much alike at that age. He became\nintensely devoted to the child and lavished every kind of care and\nattention upon it. For Genji himself he had always had so great a\npartiality that, had it not been for popular opposition, he would\ncertainly have installed him as Heir Apparent. That he had not been\nable to do so constantly distressed him. To have produced so\nmagnificent a son and be obliged to watch him growing up a mere\nnobleman had always been galling to him. Now in his old age a son had\nbeen born to him who promised to be equally handsome and had not the\ntiresome disadvantage of a plebeian mother, and upon this flawless\npearl he expended his whole affection. The mother saw little chance of\nthis rapture continuing and was all this while in a state of agonized\napprehension.\nOne day, when as he had been wont to do before, Genji was making music\nfor her at the Emperor's command, His Majesty took the child in his\narms saying to Genji: 'I have had many children, but you were the only\nother one that I ever behaved about in this fashion. It may be my\nfancy, but it seems to me this child is exactly like what you were at\nthe same age. However, I suppose all babies are very much alike while\nthey are as small as this,' and he looked at the fine child with\nadmiration. A succession of violent emotions\u2014terror, shame, pride and\nlove\u2014passed through Genji's breast while these words were being\nspoken, and were reflected in his rapidly changing colour. He was\nalmost in tears. The child looked so exquisitely beautiful as it lay\ncrowing to itself and smiling that, hideous as the situation was,\nGenji could not help feeling glad it was thought to be like him.\nFujitsubo meanwhile was in a state of embarrassment and agitation so\npainful that a cold sweat broke out upon her while she sat by. For\nGenji this jarring of opposite emotions was too much to be borne and\nhe went home. Here he lay tossing on his bed and, unable to\ndistract himself, he determined after a while to go to the Great Hall.\nAs he passed by the flower-beds in front of his house he noticed that\na faint tinge of green was already filming the bushes and under them\nthe _tokonatsu_[9] were already in bloom. He plucked one and sent it\nto \u014cmy\u014dbu with a long letter and an acrostic poem in which he said\nthat he was touched by the likeness of this flower to the child, but\nalso hinted that he was perturbed by the child's likeness to himself.\n'In this flower,' he continued despondently, 'I had hoped to see your\nbeauty enshrined. But now I know that being mine yet not mine it can\nbring me no comfort to look upon it.' After waiting a little while\ntill a favourable moment should arise \u014cmy\u014dbu showed her mistress the\nletter, saying with a sigh 'I fear that your answer will be but dust\nto the petals of this thirsting flower.' But Fujitsubo, in whose heart\nalso the new spring was awakening a host of tender thoughts, wrote in\nanswer the poem: 'Though it alone be the cause that these poor sleeves\nare wet with dew, yet goes my heart still with it, this child-flower\nof Yamato Land.' This was all and it was roughly scribbled in a faint\nhand, but it was a comfort to \u014cmy\u014dbu to have even such a message as\nthis to bring back. Genji knew quite well that it could lead to\nnothing. How many times had she sent him such messages before! Yet as\nhe lay dejectedly gazing at the note, the mere sight of her\nhandwriting soon stirred in him a frenzy of unreasoning excitement and",

At last\nunable to remain any longer inactive he sprang up and went, as he had\nso often done before, to the western wing to seek distraction from the\nagitated thoughts which pursued him. He came towards the women's\napartments with his hair loose upon his shoulders, wearing a queer\ndressing-gown and, in order to amuse Murasaki, playing a tune on\nhis flute as he walked. He peeped in at the door. She looked as she\nlay there for all the world like the fresh dewy flower that he had so\nrecently plucked. She was growing a little bit spoilt and having heard\nsome while ago that he had returned from Court she was rather cross\nwith him for not coming to see her at once. She did not run to meet\nhim as she usually did, but lay with her head turned away. He called\nto her from the far side of the room to get up and come to him, but\nshe did not stir. Suddenly he heard that she was murmuring to herself\nthe lines 'Like a sea-flower that the waters have covered when a great\ntide mounts the shore.' They were from an old poem[10] that he had\ntaught her, in which a lady complains that she is neglected by her\nlover. She looked bewitching as she lay with her face half-sullenly,\nhalf-coquettishly buried in her sleeve. 'How naughty,' he cried.\n'Really you are becoming too witty. But if you saw me more often\nperhaps you would grow tired of me.' Then he sent for his zithern and\nasked her to play to him. But it was a big Chinese instrument[11] with\nthirteen strings; the five slender strings in the middle embarrassed\nher and she could not get the full sound out of them. Taking it from\nher he shifted the bridge, and tuning it to a lower pitch played a few\nchords upon it and bade her try again. Her sullen mood was over. She\nbegan to play very prettily; sometimes, when there was a gap too long\nfor one small hand to stretch, helping herself out so adroitly with\nthe other hand that Genji was completely captivated and taking up his\nflute taught her a number of new tunes. She was very quick and grasped\nthe most complicated rhythms at a single hearing. She had indeed in\nmusic as in all else just those talents with which it most delighted\nhim that she should be endowed. When he played the Hosoroguseri (which\nin spite of its absurd name is an excellent tune) she accompanied\nhim though with a childish touch, yet in perfect time.\nThe great lamp was brought in and they began looking at pictures\ntogether. But Genji was going out that night. Already his attendants\nwere assembled in the courtyard outside. One of them was saying that a\nstorm was coming on. He ought not to wait any longer. Again Murasaki\nwas unhappy. She was not looking at the pictures, but sat with her\nhead on her hands staring despondently at the floor. Stroking the\nlovely hair that had fallen forward across her lap Genji asked her if\nshe missed him when he was away. She nodded. 'I am just the same,' he\nsaid. 'If I miss seeing you for a single day I am terribly unhappy.\nBut you are only a little girl and I know that whatever I do you will\nnot think harsh thoughts about me; while the lady that I go to see is\nvery jealous and angry so that it would break her heart if I were to\nstay with you too long. But I do not at all like being there and that\nis why I just go for a little while like this. When you are grown up\nof course I shall never go away at all. I only go now because if I did\nnot she would be so terribly angry with me that I might very likely\ndie[12] and then there would be no one to love you and take care of\nyou at all.' He had told her all he could, but still she was offended\nand would not answer a word. At last he took her on his knee and here\nto his great embarrassment she fell asleep. 'It is too late to go out\nnow,' he said after a while, turning to the gentlewomen who were in\nattendance. They rose and went to fetch his supper. He roused the\nchild. 'Look,' he said, 'I did not go out after all.' She was happy\nonce more and they went to supper together. She liked the queer,\nirregular meal, but when it was over she began again to watch him\nuneasily. 'If you are really not going out,' she said, 'why do\nyou not go to sleep at once?' Leaving her at such a moment to go back\nto his room he felt all the reluctance of one who is setting out upon\na long and perilous journey.\nIt constantly happened that at the last minute he thus decided to stay\nwith her. It was natural that some report of his new pre-occupation\nshould leak out into the world and be passed on to the Great Hall.\n'Who can it be?' said one of Aoi's ladies. 'It is really the most\ninexplicable business. How can he have suddenly become entirely\nwrapped up in someone whom we had never heard the existence of before?\nIt cannot in any case be a person of much breeding or self-respect. It\nis probably some girl employed at the Palace whom he has taken to live",

And this opinion was shared by the rest.\nThe Emperor too had heard that there was someone living with Genji and\nthought it a great pity. 'You are treating the Minister very badly,'\nhe said. 'He has shown the greatest possible devotion to you ever\nsince you were a mere baby and now that you are old enough to know\nbetter you behave like this towards him and his family! It is really\nmost ungrateful.'\nGenji listened respectfully, but made no reply. The Emperor began to\nfear that his marriage with Aoi had proved a very unhappy one and was\nsorry that he had arranged it. 'I do not understand you,' he said.\n'You seem to have no taste for gallantry and do not, so far as I can\nsee, take the slightest interest in any of the ladies-in-waiting whom\none might expect you to find attractive, nor do you bother yourself\nabout the various beauties who in one part of the town or another are\nnow in request; but instead you must needs pick up some creature from\nno one knows where and wound the feelings of others by keeping\nher as your mistress!'\nThough he was now getting on in years the Emperor had himself by no\nmeans ceased to be interested in such matters. He had always seen to\nit that his ladies-in-waiting and palace-servants should be remarkable\nboth for their looks and their intelligence, and it was a time when\nthe Court was full of interesting women. There were few among them\nwhom Genji could not by the slightest word or gesture have made his\nown. But, perhaps because he saw too much of them, he did not find\nthem in the least attractive. Suspecting this, they would occasionally\nexperiment upon him with some frivolous remark. He answered so staidly\nthat they saw a flirtation would be impossible and some of them came\nto the conclusion that he was rather a dull, prudish young man.\nThere was an elderly lady-of-the-bedchamber who, though she was an\nexcellent creature in every other way and was very much liked and\nrespected, was an outrageous flirt. It astonished Genji that despite\nher advancing years she showed no sign of reforming her reckless and\nfantastic behaviour. Curious to see how she would take it he one day\ncame up and began joking with her. She appeared to be quite\nunconscious of the disparity between their ages and at once counted\nhim as an admirer. Slightly alarmed, he nevertheless found her company\nrather agreeable and often talked with her. But, chiefly because he\nwas frightened of being laughed at if anyone found out, he refused to\nbecome her lover, and this she very much resented. One day she was\ndressing the Emperor's hair. When this was over his Majesty sent for\nhis valets and went with them into another room. Genji and the elderly\nlady were left alone together. She was fuller than ever of languishing\nairs and poses, and her costume was to the last degree stylish and\nelaborate. 'Poor creature,' he thought, 'How little difference it\nall makes!' and he was passing her on his way out of the room when\nsuddenly the temptation to give a tug at her dress became\nirresistible. She glanced swiftly round, eyeing him above the rim of a\nmarvellously painted summer-fan. The eyelids beneath which she ogled\nat him were blackened and sunken; wisps of hair projected untidily\naround her forehead. There was something singularly inappropriate\nabout this gawdy, coquettish fan. Handing her his own instead, he took\nit from her and examined it. On paper coated with a red so thick and\nlustrous that you could see yourself reflected in it a forest of tall\ntrees was painted in gold. At the side of this design, in a hand which\nthough out-of-date was not lacking in distinction was written the poem\nabout the Forest of Oaraki.[13] He made no doubt that the owner of the\nfan had written it in allusion to her own advancing years and was\nexpecting him to make a gallant reply. Turning over in his mind how\nbest to divert the extravagant ardour of this strange creature he\ncould, to his own amusement, think only of another poem[14] about the\nsame forest; but to this it would have been ill-bred to allude. He was\nfeeling very uncomfortable lest someone should come in and see them\ntogether. She however was quite at her ease and seeing that he\nremained silent she recited with many arch looks the poem: 'Come to me\nin the forest and I will cut pasture for your horse, though it be but\nof the under leaf whose season is past.' 'Should I seek your\nwoodland,' he answered, 'my fair name would be gone, for down its\nglades at all times the pattering of hoofs is heard,' and he tried to\nget away; but she held him back saying: 'How odious you are! That is\nnot what I mean at all. No one has ever insulted me like this\nbefore,' and she burst into tears. 'Let us talk about it some other\ntime,' said Genji; 'I did not mean ...' and freeing himself from her\ngrasp he rushed out of the room, leaving her in great dudgeon. She\nfelt indeed after his repulse prodigiously old and tottering. All this\nwas seen by His Majesty who, his toilet long ago completed, had\nwatched the ill-assorted pair with great amusement from behind his\nImperial screen. 'I am always being told,' he said, 'that the boy\ntakes no interest in the members of my household. But I cannot say\nthat he seems to me unduly shy,' and he laughed. For a moment she was\nslightly embarrassed; but she felt that any relationship with Genji,\neven if it consisted of being rebuffed by him in public, was\ndistinctly a feather in her cap, and she made no attempt to defend\nherself against the Emperor's raillery. The story soon went the round\nof the Court. It astonished no one more than T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d who, though\nhe knew that Genji was given to odd experiments, could not believe\nthat his friend was really launched upon the fantastic courtship which\nrumour was attributing to him. There seemed no better way of\ndiscovering whether it was conceivably possible to regard the lady in\nsuch a light than to make love to her himself.\nThe attentions of so distinguished a suitor went a long way towards\nconsoling her for her late discomfiture. Her new intrigue was of\ncourse carried on with absolute secrecy and Genji knew nothing about\nit. When he next met her she seemed to be very cross with him, and\nfeeling sorry for her because she was so old he made up his mind that\nhe must try to console her. But for a long while he was completely\noccupied by tiresome business of one kind and another. At last one\nvery dismal rainy evening when he was strolling in the neighbourhood\nof the Ummeiden[15] he heard this lady playing most agreeably on\nher lute. She was so good a performer that she was often called upon\nto play with the professional male musicians in the Imperial\norchestra. It happened that at this moment she was somewhat downcast\nand discontented, and in such a mood she played with even greater\nfeeling and verve. She was singing the 'Melon-grower's Song'[16];\nadmirably, he thought, despite its inappropriateness to her age. So\nmust the voice of the mysterious lady at O-chou have sounded in Po\nCh\u00fc-i's ears when he heard her singing on her boat at night[17]; and\nhe stood listening. At the end of the song the player sighed heavily\nas though quite worn out by the passionate vehemence of her serenade.\nGenji approached softly humming the 'Azumaya': 'Here in the portico of\nthe eastern house rain splashes on me while I wait. Come, my beloved,\nopen the door and let me in.' Immediately, indeed with an unseemly\nhaste, she answered as does the lady in the song 'Open the door and\ncome in,'[18] adding the verse: 'In the wide shelter of that portico\nno man yet was ever splashed with rain,' and again she sighed so\nportentously that although he did not at all suppose that he alone was\nthe cause of this demonstration he felt it in any case to be somewhat\nexaggerated and answered with the poem: 'Your sighs show clearly that,\ndespite the song, you are another's bride, and I for my part have no\nmind to haunt the loggias of your eastern house.' He would gladly have\npassed on, but he felt that this would be too unkind, and seeing that\nsomeone else was coming towards her room he stepped inside and\nbegan talking lightly of indifferent subjects, in a style which though\nit was in reality somewhat forced she found very entertaining.\nIt was intolerable, thought T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d, that Genji should be praised\nas a quiet and serious young man and should constantly rebuke him for\nhis frivolity, while all the time he was carrying on a multiplicity of\ninteresting intrigues which out of mere churlishness he kept entirely\nhidden from all his friends. For a long while Ch\u016bj\u014d had been waiting\nfor an opportunity to expose this sanctimonious imposture, and when he\nsaw Genji enter the gentlewoman's apartment you may be sure he was\ndelighted. To scare him a little at such a moment would be an\nexcellent way to punish him for his unfriendliness. He slackened his\npace and watched. The wind sighed in the trees. It was getting very\nlate. Surely Genji would soon begin to doze? And indeed he did now\nlook as though he had fallen asleep. Ch\u016bj\u014d stole on tip-toe into the\nroom; but Genji who was only half dreaming instantly heard him, and\nnot knowing that Ch\u016bj\u014d had followed him got it into his head that it\nwas a certain Commissioner of Works who years ago had been supposed to\nbe an admirer of the lady. The idea of being discovered in such a\nsituation by this important old gentleman filled him with horror.\nFurious with his companion for having exposed him to the chance of\nsuch a predicament: 'This is too bad,' he whispered 'I am going home.\nWhat possessed you to let me in on a night when you knew that someone\nelse was coming?' He had only time to snatch up his cloak and hide\nbehind a long folding screen before Ch\u016bj\u014d entered the room and going\nstraight up to the screen began in a business-like manner to fold it\nup. Though she was no longer young the lady did not lose her head in\nthis alarming crisis. Being a woman of fashion she had on more than\none occasion found herself in an equally agitating position, and\nnow despite her astonishment, after considering for a moment what had\nbest be done with the intruder, she seized him by the back of his coat\nand with a practised though trembling hand pulled him away from the\nscreen. Genji had still no idea that it was Ch\u016bj\u014d. He had half a mind\nto show himself, but quickly remembered that he was oddly and\ninadequately clad, with his head-dress all awry. He felt that if he\nran for it he would cut much too strange a figure as he left the room,\nand for a moment he hesitated. Wondering how much longer Genji would\ntake to recognize him Ch\u016bj\u014d did not say a word but putting on the most\nferocious air imaginable drew his sword from the scabbard. Whereupon\nthe lady crying 'Gentlemen! Gentlemen!' flung herself between them in\nan attitude of romantic supplication. They could hardly refrain from\nbursting into laughter. It was only by day when very carefully painted\nand bedizened that she still retained a certain superficial air of\nyouth and charm. But now this woman of fifty-seven or eight, disturbed\nby a sudden brawl in the midst of her amours, created the most\nastonishing spectacle as she knelt at the feet of two young men in\ntheir 'teens beseeching them not to die for her. Ch\u016bj\u014d however\nrefrained from showing the slightest sign of amusement and continued\nto look as alarming and ferocious as he could. But he was now in full\nview and Genji realized in a moment that Ch\u016bj\u014d had all the while known\nwho he was and had been amusing himself at his expense. Much relieved\nat this discovery he grabbed at the scabbard from which Ch\u016bj\u014d had\ndrawn the sword and held it fast lest his friend should attempt to\nescape and then, despite his annoyance at having been followed, burst\ninto an uncontrollable fit of laughter. 'Are you in your right mind?'\nsaid Genji at last. 'This is really a very poor sort of joke. Do you\nmind letting me get into my cloak?' Whereupon Ch\u016bj\u014d snatched the\ncloak from him and would not give it back. 'Very well then,' said\nGenji; 'if you are to have my cloak I must have yours,' and so saying\nhe pulled open the clasp of Ch\u016bj\u014d's belt and began tugging his cloak\nfrom his shoulders. Ch\u016bj\u014d resisted and a long tussle followed in which\nthe cloak was torn to shreds. 'Should you now get it in exchange for\nyours, this tattered cloak will but reveal the secrets it is meant to\nhide,' recited T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d; to which Genji replied with an acrostic\npoem in which he complained that Ch\u016bj\u014d with whom he shared so many\nsecrets should have thought it necessary to spy upon him in this\nfashion. But neither was really angry with the other and setting their\ndisordered costumes to rights they both took their departure. Genji\ndiscovered when he was alone that it had indeed upset him very much to\nfind his movements had been watched, and he could not sleep. The lady\nfelt utterly bewildered. On the floor she found a belt and a buckle\nwhich she sent to Genji next day with a complicated acrostic poem in\nwhich she compared these stranded properties to the weeds which after\ntheir straining and tugging the waves leave upon the shore. She added\nan allusion to the crystal river of her tears. He was irritated by her\npersistency but distressed at the shock to which she had been\nsubjected by Ch\u016bj\u014d's foolish joke, and he answered with the poem: 'At\nthe antics of the prancing wave you have good cause to be angry; but\nblameless indeed is the shore on whose sands it lashed.' The belt was\nCh\u016bj\u014d's; that was plain for it was darker in colour than his own\ncloak. And as he examined his cloak he noticed that the lower half of\none sleeve was torn away. What a mess everything was in! He told\nhimself with disgust that he was becoming a rowdy, a vulgar\nnight-brawler. Such people, he knew, were always tearing their clothes\nand making themselves ridiculous. It was time to reform.\nThe missing sleeve soon arrived from Ch\u016bj\u014d's apartments with the\nmessage: 'Had you not better have this sewn on before you wear your\ncloak?' How had he managed to get hold of it? Such tricks were very\ntiresome and silly. But he supposed he must now give back the belt,\nand wrapping it in paper of the same colour he sent it with a riddling\npoem in which he said that he would not keep it lest he should make\ntrouble between Ch\u016bj\u014d and the lady. 'You have dragged her away from me\nas in the scuffle you snatched from me this belt,' said Ch\u016bj\u014d in his\nanswering poem, and added 'Have I not good reason to be angry with you?'\nLater in the morning they met in the Presence Room. Genji wore a\nsolemn and abstracted air. Ch\u016bj\u014d could not help recollecting the\nabsurd scene of their last meeting, but it was a day upon which there\nwas a great deal of public business to dispatch and he was soon\nabsorbed in his duties. But from time to time each would catch sight\nof the other's serious face and heavy official bearing, and then they\ncould not help smiling. In an interval Ch\u016bj\u014d came up to Genji and\nasked him in a low voice whether he had decided in future to be a\nlittle more communicative about his affairs. 'No, indeed,' said Genji;\n'but I feel I owe you an apology for preventing you from spending a\nhappy hour with the lady whom you had come to visit. Everything in\nlife seems to go wrong.' So they whispered and at the end each\nsolemnly promised the other not to speak of the matter to anybody. But\nto the two of them it furnished a constant supply of jokes for a long\nwhile to come, though Genji took the matter to heart more than he\nshowed and was determined never to get mixed up with such a tiresome\ncreature again. He heard however that the lady was still much ruffled,",

But T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d was ready to dispute with him on any subject,\nand was by no means inclined always to let him have his own way. He\nand Aoi were the only children of the Emperor's sister. Genji, it is\ntrue, was the Emperor's son; but though Ch\u016bj\u014d's father was only a\nMinister his influence was far greater than that of his colleagues,\nand as the son of such a man by his marriage with a royal princess he\nwas used to being treated with the greatest deference. It had never so\nmuch as occurred to him that he was in any way Genji's inferior; for\nhe knew that as regards his person at least he had no reason to be\ndissatisfied; and with most other qualities, whether of character or\nintelligence, he believed himself to be very adequately endowed. Thus\na friendly rivalry grew up between the two of them and led to many\ndiverting incidents which it would take too long to describe.\nIn the seventh month two events of importance took place. An empress\nwas appointed[18] and Genji was raised to the rank of Counsellor. The\nEmperor was intending very soon to resign the Throne. He would have\nliked to proclaim his new-born child as Heir Apparent in place of\nK\u014dkiden's son. This was difficult, for there was no political function\nwhich would have supported such a choice. Fujitsubo's relations were\nall members of the Imperial family[19] and Genji, to whom he might\nhave looked for help owing to his affiliation with the Minamoto clan,\nunfortunately showed no aptitude for political intrigue. The best\nhe could do was at any rate to strengthen Fujitsubo's position and\nhope that later on she would be able to exert her influence. K\u014dkiden\nheard of his intentions, and small wonder if she was distressed and\nastounded. The Emperor tried to quiet her by pointing out that in a\nshort time her son would succeed to the Throne and that she would then\nhold the equally important rank of Empress Mother. But it was indeed\nhard that the mother of the Heir Apparent should be passed over in\nfavour of a concubine aged little more than twenty. The public tended\nto take K\u014dkiden's side and there was a good deal of discontent. On the\nnight when the new Empress was installed Genji, as a Counsellor, was\namong those who accompanied her to the Middle Palace. As daughter of a\nprevious Empress and mother of an exquisite prince she enjoyed a\nconsideration at Court beyond that which her new rank would have alone\nprocured for her. But if it was with admiring devotion that the other\ngreat lords of her train attended her that day, it may be imagined\nwith what fond yet agonized thoughts Prince Genji followed the litter\nin which she rode. She seemed at last to have been raised so far\nbeyond his reach that scarce knowing what he did he murmured to\nhimself the lines: 'Now upon love's dark path has the last shadow\nclosed; for I have seen you carried to a cloud-land whither none may\nclimb.'\nAs the days and months went by the child grew more and more like\nGenji. The new Empress was greatly distressed, but no one else seemed\nto notice the resemblance. He was not of course so handsome; how\nindeed should he have been? But both were beautiful, and the world was\ncontent to accept their beauty without troubling to compare them, just\nas it accepts both moon and sun as lovely occupants of the sky.\n[1] They were not allowed to leave the palace.",

            "text": "About the twentieth day of the second month the Emperor gave a Chinese\nbanquet under the great cherry-tree of the Southern Court. Both\nFujitsubo and the Heir Apparent were to be there. K\u014dkiden, although\nshe knew that the mere presence of the Empress was sufficient to spoil\nher pleasure, could not bring herself to forego so delightful an\nentertainment. After some promise of rain the day turned out\nmagnificent; and in full sunshine, with the birds singing in every\ntree, the guests (royal princes, noblemen and professional poets\nalike) were handed the rhyme words which the Emperor had drawn by lot,\nand set to work to compose their poems. It was with a clear and\nringing voice that Genji read out the word 'Spring' which he had\nreceived as the rhyme-sound of his poem. Next came T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d who,\nfeeling that all eyes were upon him and determined to impress himself\nfavourably on his audience, moved with the greatest possible elegance\nand grace; and when on receiving his rhyme he announced his name,\nrank, and titles, he took great pains to speak pleasantly as well as\naudibly. Many of the other gentlemen were rather nervous and looked\nquite pale as they came forward, yet they acquitted themselves well\nenough. But the professional poets, particularly owing to the high\nstandard of accomplishment which the Emperor's and Heir Apparent's\nlively interest in Chinese poetry had at that time diffused\nthrough the Court, were very ill at ease; as they crossed the long\nspace of the garden on their way to receive their rhymes they felt\nutterly helpless. A simple Chinese verse is surely not much to ask of\na professional poet; but they all wore an expression of the deepest\ngloom. One expects elderly scholars to be somewhat odd in their\nmovements and behaviour, and it was amusing to see the lively concern\nwith which the Emperor watched their various but always uncouth and\nerratic methods of approaching the Throne. Needless to say a great\ndeal of music had been arranged for. Towards dusk the delightful dance\nknown as the Warbling of Spring Nightingales was performed, and when\nit was over the Heir Apparent, remembering the Festival of Red Leaves,\nplaced a wreath on Genji's head and pressed him so urgently that it\nwas impossible for him to refuse. Rising to his feet he danced very\nquietly a fragment of the sleeve-turning passage in the Wave Dance. In\na few moments he was seated again, but even into this brief extract\nfrom a long dance he managed to import an unrivalled charm and grace.\nEven his father-in-law who was not in the best of humour with him was\ndeeply moved and found himself wiping away a tear.\n'And why have we not seen T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d?' said the Heir Apparent.\nWhereupon Ch\u016bj\u014d danced the Park of Willow Flowers, giving a far more\ncomplete performance than Genji, for no doubt he knew that he would be\ncalled upon and had taken trouble to prepare his dance. It was a great\nsuccess and the Emperor presented him with a cloak, which everyone\nsaid was a most unusual honour. After this the other young noblemen\nwho were present danced in no particular order, but it was now so dark\nthat it was impossible to discriminate between their performances.\nThen the poems were opened and read aloud. The reading of Genji's\nverses was continually interrupted by loud murmurs of applause.\nEven the professional poets were deeply impressed, and it may well be\nimagined what pride the Emperor, to whom at times Genji was a source\nof consolation and delight, watched him upon such an occasion as this.\nFujitsubo, when she allowed herself to glance in his direction,\nmarvelled that even K\u014dkiden could find it in her heart to hate him.\n'It is because he is fond of me; there can be no other reason,' she\ndecided at last and the verse 'Were I but a common mortal who now am\ngazing at the beauty of this flower, from its sweet petals not long\nshould I withhold the dew of love,' framed itself on her lips, though\nshe dared not utter it aloud.\nIt was now very late and the banquet was over.

The\npeople at the Palace were probably all plunged in a heavy sleep. On\nsuch a night it was not impossible that some careless person might\nhave left some door unfastened, some shutter unbarred. Cautiously and\nstealthily he crept towards Fujitsubo's apartments and inspected them.\nEvery bolt was fast. He sighed; here there was evidently nothing to be\ndone. He was passing the loggia of K\u014dkiden's palace when he noticed\nthat the shutters of the third arch were not drawn. After the banquet\nK\u014dkiden herself had gone straight to the Emperor's rooms. There did\nnot seem to be anyone about. A door leading from the loggia into the\nhouse was standing open, but he could hear no sound within. 'It is\nunder just such circumstances as this that one is apt to drift into\ncompromising situations,' thought Genji. Nevertheless he climbed\nquietly on to the balustrade and peeped. Every one must be asleep. But\nno; a very agreeable young voice with an intonation which was\ncertainly not that of any waiting-woman or common person was softly\nhumming the last two lines of the _Oborozuki-yo_.[1] Was not the voice\ncoming towards him? It seemed so, and stretching out his hand he\nsuddenly found that he was grasping a lady's sleeve. 'Oh, how you\nfrightened me,' she cried. 'Who is it?' 'Do not be alarmed,' he\nwhispered. 'That both of us were not content to miss the beauty of\nthis departing night is proof more clear than the half-clouded moon\nthat we were meant to meet,' and as he recited the words he took her\ngently by the hand and led her into the house, closing the door behind\nthem. Her surprised and puzzled air fascinated him. 'There is someone\nthere,' she whispered tremulously, pointing to the inner room. 'Child'\nhe answered, 'I am allowed to go wherever I please and if you send for\nyour friends they will only tell you that I have every right to be\nhere. But if you will stay quietly here....' It was Genji. She knew\nhis voice and the discovery somewhat reassured her. She thought his\nconduct rather strange, but she was determined that he should not\nthink her prudish or stiff. And so because he on his side was still\nsomewhat excited after the doings of the evening, while she was far\ntoo young and pliant to offer any serious resistance, he soon got his\nown way with her.\nSuddenly they saw to their discomfiture that dawn was creeping into\nthe sky. She looked, thought Genji, as though many disquieting\nreflections were crowding into her mind. 'Tell me your name' he said.\n'How can I write to you unless you do? Surely this is not going to be\nour only meeting?' She answered with a poem in which she said that\nnames are of this world only and he would not care to know hers if he\nwere resolved that their love should last till worlds to come. It\nwas a mere quip and Genji, amused at her quickness, answered 'You are\nquite right. It was a mistake on my part to ask.' And he recited the\npoem 'While still I seek to find on which blade dwells the dew, a\ngreat wind shakes the grasses of the level land.' 'If you did not\nrepent of this meeting,' he continued, 'you would surely tell me who\nyou are. I do not believe that you want....'

'Among a group of persons who seemed to be the domestic\nattendants of those for whom the coaches were waiting two gentlemen\ncame threading their way in a great hurry. These we recognized as Shii\nno Sh\u014dsh\u014d and Uch\u016bben,[2] so there is little doubt that the carriages\nbelonged to Princess K\u014dkiden. For the rest we noted that the ladies\nwere by no means ill looking and that the whole party drove away in\nthree carriages.' Genji's heart beat fast. But he was no nearer than\nbefore to finding out which of the sisters it had been. Supposing her\nfather, the Minister of the Right, should hear anything of this, what\na to-do there would be! It would indeed mean his absolute ruin. It was\na pity that while he was about it he did not stay with her till it was\na little lighter. But there it was! He did not know her face, but yet\nhe was determined to recognize her. How? He lay on his bed\ndevising and rejecting endless schemes. Murasaki too must be growing\nimpatient. Days had passed since he had visited her and he remembered\nwith tenderness how low-spirited she became when he was not able to be\nwith her. But in a moment his thoughts had returned to the unknown\nlady. He still had her fan. It was a folding fan with ribs of\nhinoki-wood and tassels tied in a splice-knot. One side was covered\nwith silverleaf on which was painted a dim moon, giving the impression\nof a moon reflected in water. It was a device which he had seen many\ntimes before, but it had agreeable associations for him, and\ncontinuing the metaphor of the 'grass on the moor' which she had used\nin her poem he wrote on the fan\u2014'Has mortal man ever puzzled his head\nwith such a question before as to ask where the moon goes to when she\nleaves the sky at dawn?' And he put the fan safely away. It was on his\nconscience that he had not for a long while been to the Great Hall;\nbut fearing that Murasaki too might be feeling very unhappy he first\nwent home to give her her lessons. Every day she was improving not\nonly in looks, but also in amiability of character. The beauty of her\ndisposition was indeed quite out of the common. The idea that so\nperfect a nature was in his hands, to train and cultivate as he\nthought best, was very attractive to Genji. It might however have been\nobjected that to receive all her education from a young man is likely\nto make a girl somewhat forward in her manner.\nFirst there was a great deal to tell her about what had happened at\nthe Court entertainments of the last few days. Then followed her music\nlesson, and already it was time to go. 'Oh why must he always go away\nso soon?' she wondered sadly, but by now she was so used to it that\nshe no longer fretted as she had done a little while ago.\nAt the Great Hall he could, as usual, scarcely get a word out of\nAoi. The moment that he sat idle a thousand doubts and puzzles began\nto revolve in his mind. He took up his zithern and began to sing:\nNot softlier pillowed is my head\nThat rests by thine, unloving bride,\nThan were those jagged stones my bed\nThrough which the falls of Nuki stride.\nAt this moment Aoi's father came by and began to discuss the unusual\nsuccess of the recent festivities. 'Old as I am,' he said\u2014'and I may\nsay that I have lived to see four illustrious sovereigns occupy the\nThrone, I have never taken part in a banquet which produced verses so\nspirited or dancing and music so admirably performed. Talent of every\ndescription seems at present to exist in abundance; but it is\ncreditable to those in authority that they knew how to make good use\nof it. For my part I enjoyed myself so much that had I but been a few\nyears younger I would positively have joined in the dancing!' 'No\nspecial steps were taken to discover the musicians,' answered Genji.\n'We merely used those who were known to the government in one part of\nthe country and another as capable performers. If I may say so, it was\nCh\u016bj\u014d's Willow Dance that made the deepest impression and is likely\nalways to be remembered as a remarkable performance. But if you, Sir,\nhad indeed honoured us a new lustre would have been added to my\nFather's reign.' Aoi's brothers now arrived and leaning against the\nbalustrade gave a little concert, their various instruments blending\ndelightfully.\nFugitive as their meeting had been it had sufficed to plunge the lady\nwhose identity Prince Genji was now seeking to establish into the\ndepths of despair; for in the fourth month she was to become the Heir\nApparent's wife. Turmoil filled her brain. Why had not Genji visited\nher again? He must surely know whose daughter she was. But how\nshould he know which daughter? Besides, her sister K\u014dkiden's house was\nnot a place where, save under very strange circumstances, he was\nlikely to feel at all at his ease. And so she waited in great\nimpatience and distress; but of Genji there was no news.",

It was followed by a wistaria feast. The\ncherry blossom was for the most part over, but two trees, which the\nMinister seemed somehow to have persuaded to flower later than all the\nrest, were still an enchanting sight. He had had his house rebuilt\nonly a short time ago when celebrating the initiation of his\ngrand-daughters, the children of K\u014dkiden. It was now a magnificent\nbuilding and not a thing in it but was of the very latest fashion. He\nhad invited Genji when he had met him at the Palace only a few days\nbefore and was extremely annoyed when he did not appear. Feeling that\nthe party would be a failure if Genji did not come, he sent his son\nShii no Sh\u014dsh\u014d to fetch him, with the poem: 'Were my flowers as those\nof other gardens never should I have ventured to summon you.' Genji\nwas in attendance upon the Emperor and at once showed him the message.\n'He seems very pleased with himself and his flowers,' said his Majesty\nwith a smile; adding 'as he has sent for you like this, I think you\nhad better go. After all your half-sisters are being brought up at his\nhouse, and you ought not to treat him quite as a stranger.' He went to\nhis apartments and dressed. It was very late indeed when at last he\nmade his appearance at the party. He was dressed in a cloak of thin\nChinese fabric, white outside but lined with yellow. His robe was of a\ndeep wine-red colour with a very long train. The dignity and grace\nwith which he carried this fancifully regal[3] attire in a\ncompany where all were dressed in plain official robes were indeed\nremarkable, and in the end his presence perhaps contributed more to\nthe success of the party than did the fragrance of the Minister's\nboasted flowers. His entry was followed by some very agreeable music.\nIt was already fairly late when Genji, on the plea that the wine had\ngiven him a head-ache, left his seat and went for a walk. He knew that\nhis two step-sisters, the daughters of K\u014dkiden, were in the inner\napartments of the palace. He went to the eastern portico and rested\nthere. It was on this side of the house that the wistaria grew. The\nwooden blinds were raised and a number of ladies were leaning out of\nthe window to enjoy the blossoms. They had hung bright-coloured robes\nand shawls over the window-sill just as is done at the time of the New\nYear dancing and other gala days and were behaving with a freedom of\nallure which contrasted very oddly with the sober decorum of\nFujitsubo's household. 'I am feeling rather overpowered by all the\nnoise and bustle of the flower-party' Genji explained. 'I am very\nsorry to disturb my sisters, but I can think of nowhere else to seek\nrefuge ...' and advancing towards the main door of the women's\napartments he pushed back the curtain with his shoulder. 'Refuge\nindeed!' cried one of the ladies laughing at him. 'You ought to know\nby now that it is only poor relations who come to seek refuge with the\nmore successful members of their family. What pray have you come to\nbother us for?' 'Impertinent creatures!' he thought but nevertheless\nthere was something in their manner which convinced him they were\npersons of some consequence in the house and not, as he at first\nsupposed, mere waiting-women. A scent of costly perfumes pervaded\nthe room; silken skirts rustled in the darkness. There could be little\ndoubt that these were K\u014dkiden's sisters and their friends. Deeply\nabsorbed, as indeed was the whole of this family, in the fashionable\ngaieties of the moment, they had flouted decorum and posted themselves\nat the window that they might see what little they could of the\nbanquet which was proceeding outside. Little thinking that his plan\ncould succeed, yet led on by delightful recollections of his previous\nencounter he advanced towards them chanting in a careless undertone\nthe song:\nAt Ishikawa, Ishikawa\nA man from Koma[4] took my belt away....\nBut for 'belt' he substituted 'fan' and by this means he sought to\ndiscover which of the ladies was his friend. 'Why, you have got it\nwrong! I never heard of _that_ Korean' one of them cried. Certainly it\nwas not she. But there was another who though she remained silent\nseemed to him to be sighing softly to herself. He stole towards the\ncurtain-of-state behind which she was sitting and taking her hand in\nhis at a venture he whispered the poem: 'If on this day of shooting my\narrow went astray, 'twas that in dim morning twilight only the mark\nhad glimmered in my view.' And she, unable any longer to hide that she\nknew him, answered with the verse: 'Had it been with the arrows of the\nheart that you had shot, though from the moon's slim bow no brightness\ncame would you have missed your mark?' Yes, it was her voice. He was\ndelighted, and yet....\n[1] A famous poem by \u014cye no Chisato (ninth century): 'What so lovely\nas a night when the moon though dimly clouded is never wholly lost to\nsight.'\n[2] K\u014dkiden's brothers.\n[3] He had no right to such a costume; for though a son of the\nEmperor, he had been affiliated to the Minamoto clan and no longer\ncounted as a member of the Imperial family.",

His recent promotion[1] too brought with it heavy\nresponsibilities which sadly interrupted the course of his hidden\nfriendships, so that complaints of desertion or neglect were soon\nheaped upon him from more than one quarter; while, as though Fate\nwished to turn the tables upon him, the one being on earth for whose\nlove he longed in vain had now utterly abandoned him. Now that the\nEmperor was free to live as he chose she was more constantly than ever\nat his side, nor was her peace any longer disturbed by the presence of\na rival, for K\u014dkiden resenting the old Emperor's neglect now seldom\nleft her son's Palace. A constant succession of banquets and\nentertainments, the magnificence of which became the talk of the whole\ncountry, helped to enliven the ex-Emperor's retirement and he was on\nthe whole very well content with his new condition. His only regret\nconcerned the Heir Apparent[2] whose position, unsupported by any\npowerful influence outside the Palace, he regarded as extremely\ninsecure. He constantly discussed the matter with Genji, begging him\nto enlist the support of the Minamoto clan. Such conversations tended\nto be somewhat embarrassing, but they gave Genji pleasure in so\nfar as they enabled him to take measures for the boy's welfare.\nAn unexpected event now occurred. Lady Rokuj\u014d's daughter by her late\nhusband Prince Zemb\u014d was chosen to be the new Vestal Virgin at Ise.[3]\nHer mother, who at the time when the appointment was first announced\nhappened to be particularly aggrieved at Genji's treatment of her, at\nonce determined to make her daughter's extreme youth a pretext for\nleaving the Capital and settling permanently at Ise. Being at the\nmoment, as I have said, very much out of humour, she discussed the\nmatter openly, making no secret of her real reasons for wishing to\nleave the City. The story soon reached the ex-Emperor's ears, and\nsending for Genji he said to him 'The late Prince my brother was, as\nyou probably know, regarded with the utmost affection and esteem and I\nam profoundly grieved to hear that your reckless and inconsiderate\nconduct has cast a slur upon his family. For his daughter indeed I\nfeel as much responsible as if she were of my own children. I must\ntrouble you in future to safeguard to the utmost of your power the\nreputation of these unfortunate ladies. If you do not learn to keep\nbetter control over your frivolous inclinations you will soon find\nyourself becoming extremely unpopular.' Why should his father be so\nmuch upset over the matter? And Genji, smarting under the rebuke, was\nabout to defend himself when it occurred to him that the warning was",

It is to see Prince Genji that all these people have come\nto-day. Why, all sorts of queer wild men from the mountains are here,\nand people have brought their wives and children from provinces ever\nso far away. If all these people who are nothing to do with him have\ntaken the trouble to come so far, it will be too bad if you, his own\nlady, are not there!' Overhearing this Aoi's mother joined in. 'You\nare feeling much better just now,' she said; 'I think you ought to\nmake the effort. It will be so disappointing for your gentlewomen....'\nAt the last minute Aoi changed her mind and announced that she was\ngoing. It was now so late that there was no time to put on gala\nclothes. The whole of the enclosure allotted for this purpose was\nalready lined with coaches which were packed so close that it was\nquite impossible to find space for the large and numerous carriages of\nAoi and her train. A number of grand ladies began to make room for\nher, backing their coaches away from a suitable space in the reserved\nenclosure. Conspicuous among the rest were two basket-work carriages\nof a rather old-fashioned pattern but with curtains such as are used\nby persons of quality, very discreetly decked with draperies that\nbarely showed beneath the curtains, yet these draperies (whether\nsleeve-favour, skirt or scarf) all of the handsomest colours. They\nseemed to belong to some exalted personage who did not wish to be\nrecognized. When it was their turn to move, the coachmen in charge of\nthem would not lift a finger. 'It is not for such as we to make way'\nthey said stiffly and did not stir. Among the attendants on both sides\nthere was a number of young grooms who were already the worse for\nliquor. They were longing for a scuffle and it was impossible to keep\nthem in hand. The staid and elderly outriders tried to call them back,\nbut they took no notice.\nThe two carriages belonged to Princess Rokuj\u014d who had come secretly to\nthe festival hoping for a while to find distraction from her troubles.\nDespite the steps which she had taken to conceal her identity, it was\nat once suspected by some of Aoi's gentlemen and they cried to the\ngrooms that this was not an equipage which could be dealt with so\nhigh-handedly or it would be said that their lady was abusing her\nposition as wife of the Lord Commander. But at this moment a number of\nGenji's servants mingled in the fray. They knew Rokuj\u014d's men by sight,\nbut after a moment's embarrassment they decided not to give assistance\nto the enemy by betraying his identity.\nThus reinforced Aoi's side won the day and at length her coach and\nthose of all her ladies were drawn up along the front row, while\nRokuj\u014d's was pushed back among a miscellaneous collection of carts and\ngigs where she could see nothing at all. She was vexed beyond measure\nnot only at missing what she had come to see but also that despite all\nher precautions she had been recognized and (as she was convinced)\ndeliberately insulted. Her shaft-rest and other parts of her coach as\nwell were damaged and she was obliged to prop it up against some\ncommon person's carriage wheels. Why, she vainly asked herself, had\nshe come among these hateful crowds? She would go home at once. What\nsense was there in waiting for the procession to come? But when she\ntried to go, she found that it was impossible to force a way through\nthe dense crowds. She was still struggling to escape when the cry went\nup that the procession was in sight. Her resolution weakened. She\nwould wait till Genji had passed by. He did not see her. How should\nhe, for the crowds flashed by him like the hurrying images that a\nstream catches and breaks. She realized this, yet her disappointment\nwas none the less.\nThe carriages that lined the route, decked and garlanded for this\ngreat day, were crammed to overflowing with excited ladies who though\nthere was no room for them would not consent to be left behind.\nPeeping out under the blinds of their coaches they smiled at the great\npersonages who were passing quite regardless of whether their\ngreetings were acknowledged. But every now and then a smile would be\nrewarded by a quick glance or the backward turn of a head. Aoi's party\nwas large and conspicuous. He wheeled round as he passed and saluted\nits members attentively. Rider after rider again as the procession\nwent by would pause in front of Aoi's coach and salute her with the\ndeepest respect. The humiliation of witnessing all this from an\nobscure corner was more than Rokuj\u014d could bear, and murmuring the\nlines 'Though I saw him but as a shadow that falls on hurrying waters",

She was in great distress, but\nthough the healers recited prayer upon prayer their utmost efforts\ncould not shift by one jot the spiteful power which possessed her. All\nthe greatest miracle-workers of the land were there; the utter failure\nof their ministrations irritated and perplexed them. At last, daunted\nby the potency of their incantations, the spirit that possessed her\nfound voice and, weeping bitterly, she was heard to say: 'Give me a\nlittle respite; there is a matter of which Prince Genji and I must\nspeak.' The healers nodded at one another as though to say 'Now we\nshall learn something worth knowing,' for they were convinced that the\n'possession' was speaking through the mouth of the possessed, and they\nhurried Genji to her bedside. Her parents thinking that, her end being\nnear, she desired to give some last secret injunction to Genji,\nretired to the back of the room. The priests too ceased their\nincantations and began to recite the _Hokkekyo_[15] in low impressive\ntones. He raised the bed-curtain. She looked lovely as ever as\nshe lay there, very big with child, and any man who saw her even\nnow would have found himself strangely troubled by her beauty. How\nmuch the more then Prince Genji, whose heart was already overflowing\nwith tenderness and remorse! The plaited tresses of her long hair\nstood out in sharp contrast to her white jacket.[16] Even to this\nloose, sick-room garb her natural grace imparted the air of a\nfashionable gown! He took her hand. 'It is terrible' he began, 'to see\nyou looking so unhappy ...' he could say no more. Still she gazed at\nhim, but through his tears he saw that there was no longer in her eyes\nthe wounded scorn that he had come to know so well, but a look of\nforbearance and tender concern; and while she watched him weep her own\neyes brimmed with tears. It would not do for him to go on crying like\nthis. Her father and mother would be alarmed; besides, it was\nupsetting Aoi herself, and meaning to cheer her he said: 'Come, things\nare not so bad as that! You will soon be much better. But even if\nanything should happen, it is certain that we shall meet again in\nworlds to come. Your father and mother too, and many others, love you\nso dearly that between your fate and theirs must be some sure bond\nthat will bring you back to them in many, many lives that are to be.'\nSuddenly she interrupted him: 'No, no. That is not it. But stop these\nprayers awhile. They do me great harm,' and drawing him nearer to her\nshe went on 'I did not think that you would come. I have waited for\nyou till all my soul is burnt with longing.' She spoke wistfully,\ntenderly; and still in the same tone recited the verse 'Bind thou, as\nthe seam of a skirt is braided, this shred, that from my soul despair\nand loneliness have sundered.' The voice in which these words were\nsaid was not Aoi's; nor was the manner hers. He knew someone\nwhose voice was very like that. Who was it? Why, yes; surely only\nshe,\u2014the Lady Rokuj\u014d. Once or twice he had heard people suggest that\nsomething of this kind might be happening; but he had always rejected\nthe idea as hideous and unthinkable, believing it to be the malicious\ninvention of some unprincipled scandalmonger, and had even denied that\nsuch 'possession' ever took place. Now he had seen one with his own\neyes. Ghastly, unbelievable as they were, such things did happen in\nreal life. Controlling himself at last he said in a low voice: 'I am\nnot sure who is speaking to me. Do not leave me in doubt....' Her\nanswer proved only too conclusively that he had guessed aright. To his\nhorror her parents now came back to the bed, but she had ceased to\nspeak, and seeing her now lying quietly her mother thought the attack\nwas over, and was coming towards the bed carrying a basin of hot water\nwhen Aoi suddenly started up and bore a child. For the moment all was\ngladness and rejoicing; but it seemed only too likely that the spirit\nwhich possessed her had but been temporarily dislodged; for a fierce\nfit of terror was soon upon her, as though the thing (whatever it was)\nwere angry at having been put to the trouble of shifting, so that\nthere was still grave anxiety about the future. The Abbot of Tendai\nand the other great ecclesiastics who were gathered together in the\nroom attributed her easy delivery to the persistency of their own\nincantations and prayers, and as they hastily withdrew to seek\nrefreshment and repose they wiped the sweat from their brows with an\nexpression of considerable self-satisfaction.

Even in\nthis huge open space there was scarcely room for the crowds of\nmourners who had come from all the great palaces of the City to follow\nbehind the bier and for the concourses of priests who, chanting their\nliturgies, flocked from the neighbouring temples. The ex-Emperor was\nof course represented; so were the Princess K\u014dkiden and the Heir\nApparent; while many other important people came in person and mingled\nwith the crowd. Never had any funeral aroused so universal a\ndemonstration of interest and sympathy. Her father was not present:\n'Now in my declining years to have lost one who was so young and\nstrong is a blow too staggering ...' he said and he could no longer\ncheck the tears which he was striving to conceal. His grief was\nheart-rending. All night long the mournful ceremonies proceeded, but\nat last only a few pitiful ashes remained upon the pyre and in the\nmorning the mourners returned to their homes. It was in fact, save for\nits grandeurs, much like any other funeral; but it so happened that\nsave in one case only death had not yet come Genji's way and the\nscenes of that day haunted him long afterwards with hideous persistency.\nThe ceremony took place in the last week of the eighth month.

He lay down, but could not sleep. His\nthoughts went back over the years that he had known her. Why had he\nbeen content lazily to assume that in the end all would go right and\nmeanwhile amused himself regardless of her resentment? Why had he let\nyear after year go by without managing even at the very end to\nestablish any real intimacy, any sympathy between them? The bitterest\nremorse now filled his heart; but what use was it? His servants\nbrought him his light grey mourner's dress and the strange thought\nfloated into his mind 'What if I had died instead and not she? She\nwould be getting into the woman-mourner's deep-dyed robe,' and he\nrecited the poem: 'Though light in hue the dress which in bereavement\ncustom bids me wear, yet black my sorrow as the gown thou wouldst have\nworn;' and as thus clad he told his rosary those about him noted that\neven the dull hues of mourning could not make him look peaked or drab.\nHe read many s\u016btras in a low voice, among them the liturgy to\nSamantabhadra as Dispenser of the Dharmadh\u0101tu Sam\u0101dhi, which he\nrecited with an earnestness more impressive in its way than the\ndexterous intonation of the professional cleric. Next he visited the\nnew-born child and took some comfort in the reflection that she\nhad at least left behind her this memorial of their love. Genji did\nnot attempt to go even for the day to the Nij\u014d-in, but remained buried\nin recollections and regrets with no other occupation save the\nordering of masses for her soul. He did however bring himself to write\na few letters, among them one to Rokuj\u014d. The Virgin Elect was already\nin charge of the Guardsmen of the Gate and would soon be passed on by\nthem to the Palace-in-the-Fields. Rokuj\u014d accordingly made her\ndaughter's situation an excuse for sending no reply.[19] He was now so\nweary of life and its miseries that he seriously contemplated the\ntaking of priestly vows, and might perhaps have done so, had there not\nbeen a new bond which seemed to tie him irrevocably to the world.

            "text": "his palace. How unhappy she must have been during all this long time!\nThat night lying all alone within his royal curtains, though watchmen\nwere going their rounds not far away, he felt very lonely and\nremembering that 'autumn is no time to lie alone,' he sent for the\nsweetest voiced among the chaplains of the palace. His chanting\nmingled with the sounds of early dawn was indeed of almost unendurable\nbeauty. But soon the melancholy of late autumn, the murmur of the\nrising wind took possession of him, and little used to lonely nights\nhe found it hard to keep his bed till morning. Looking out he saw that\na heavy mist lay over the garden beds; yet despite the mist it was\nclear that something was tied to the stem of a fine chrysanthemum not\nfar away. It was a letter written on dark blue paper.[20] The\nmessenger had left it there and gone away. 'What a charming idea!' he\nwas thinking when he suddenly recognized the hand. It was from\nRokuj\u014d. She began by saying she did not think, having regard to her\ndaughter's situation, that he would be surprised at her long delay in\nanswering his previous note. She added an acrostic poem in which,\nplaying upon the word chrysanthemum (_kiku_) she told him of her\ndistress at hearing (_kiku_) of his bereavement. 'The beauty of the\nmorning' she ended, 'turned my thoughts more than ever towards you and\nyour sorrow; that is why I could not choose but answer you.' It was\nwritten even more elegantly than usual; but he tossed it aside. Her\ncondolences wounded him, for after what he had seen he knew that they\ncould not be sincere. Nevertheless he felt that it would be too harsh\nto break off all communication with her; that he should do so would in\nfact tend to incriminate her, and this was the last thing he desired.\nAfter all, it was probably not _that_ at all which had brought about\nthe disaster; maybe Aoi's fate was sealed in any case. If only he had\nchanced never to see or hear the fatal operation of her spirit! As it\nwas, argue with himself as he might, he doubted whether he would ever\nbe able to efface the impression of what had been revealed to him at\nthat hideous scene.\nHe had the excuse that he was still in deep mourning and that to\nreceive a letter from him would inconvenience her at this stage of her\ndaughter's Purification. But after turning the matter over in his mind\nfor a long while, he decided that it would be unfeeling not to answer\na letter which had evidently been written with the sole object of\ngiving him pleasure and on a paper lightly tinted with brown he wrote:\n'Though I have let so many days slip by, believe me that you have not\nbeen absent from my thoughts. If I was reluctant to answer your\nletter, it was because, as a mourner, I was loath to trespass upon the\nsanctity which now surrounds your home, and this I trusted that\nyou would understand. Do not brood overmuch upon what has happened;\nfor \"go we late or soon, more frail our lives than dew-drops hanging\nin the morning light.\" For the present, think of it no more. I say\nthis now, because it is not possible for us to meet.'\nShe received the letter at her daughter's place of preparation, but\ndid not read it till she was back in her own house. At a glance she\nknew at what he was hinting. So he too accused her! And at last the\nhideous conviction of her own guilt forced itself upon her acceptance.\nHer misery increased tenfold.\nIf even Genji had reason to believe in her guilt, her brother-in-law,\nthe ex-Emperor, must already have been informed. What was he thinking\nof her? Her dead husband, Prince Zemb\u014d, had been the brother whom he\nhad loved best. He had accepted the guardianship of the little girl\nwho was now about to be consecrated and at his brother's earnest\nentreaty had promised to undertake her education and indeed treat her\nas though she were his own child. The old Emperor had constantly\ninvited the widowed lady and her daughter to live with him in the\nPalace, but she was reluctant to accept this offer, which indeed was\nsomewhat impracticable. Meanwhile she allowed herself to listen to\nGenji's youthful addresses and was soon living in constant torment and\nagitation lest her indiscretion should be discovered. During the whole\nperiod of this escapade she was in such a state of mingled excitement\nand apprehension that she scarcely knew what she was doing. In the\nworld at large she had the reputation of being a great beauty\nand this, combined with her exalted lineage, brought to the\nPalace-in-the-Fields, so soon as it was known that she had repaired\nthither with her daughter, a host of frivolous dandies from the Court,\nwho made it their business to force upon her their fashionable\nattentions morning, noon and night. Genji heard of this and did\nnot blame them. He could only think it was a thousand pities that a\nwoman endowed with every talent and charm, should take it into her\nhead that she had done with the world and prepare to remove herself to\nso remote a place. He could not help thinking that she would find Ise\nextremely dull when she got there.\nThough the masses for Aoi's soul were now over, he remained in\nretirement till the end of the seven weeks. He was not used to doing\nnothing and the time hung heavy on his hands. Often he sent for T\u014d no\nCh\u016bj\u014d to tell him all that was going on in the world, and among much\nserious information Ch\u016bj\u014d would often seek to distract him by\ndiscussing the strange escapades in which they had sometimes shared.\nOn one of these occasions he indulged in some jokes at the expense of\nthe ancient lady-of-the-bedchamber with whom Genji had so indiscreetly\nbecome involved. 'Poor old lady!' Genji protested; 'it is too bad to\nmake fun of her in this way. Please do not do it.' But all the same he\nhad to admit to himself that he could never think of her without\nsmiling. Then Ch\u016bj\u014d told him the whole story of how he had followed\nand watched him on that autumn night, the first after the full\nmoon,[21] and many other stories besides of his own adventures and\nother people's. But in the end they fell to talking of their common\nloss, and agreeing that taken all in all life was but a sad business\nthey parted in tears.\nSome weeks afterwards on a gloomy wet evening Ch\u016bj\u014d strode into the\nroom looking somewhat self-conscious in the light grey winter cloak\nand breeches which he was to-day wearing for the first time.[22] Genji\nwas leaning against the balustrade of the balcony above the main\nwestern door. For a long while he had been gazing at the frost-clad\ngardens which surrounded the house. A high wind was blowing and\nswift showers dashed against the trees. Near to tears he murmured\nto himself the line 'Tell me whether her soul be in the rain or\nwhether in the clouds above!'[23] And as Ch\u016bj\u014d watched him sitting\nthere, his chin resting upon his hand, he thought the soul of one who\nhad been wedded to so lovely a youth would not indeed have borne quite\nto renounce the scene of her earthly life and must surely be hovering\nvery near him. Still gazing with eager admiration Ch\u016bj\u014d came to\nGenji's side. He noticed now that though his friend had not in any\nother way abated the plainness of his dress, he had to-day put on a\ncoloured sash. This streak of deep red showed up against his grey\ncloak (which though still a summer one[24] was of darker colour than\nthat which he had lately been wearing) in so attractive a way that\nthough the effect was very different from that of the magnificent\nattires which Genji had affected in happier days, yet Ch\u016bj\u014d could not\nfor a long while take his eyes off him. At last he too gazed up at the\nstormy sky, and remembering the Chinese verse which he had heard Genji\nrepeat he recited the poem: 'Though to rain her soul be turned, yet\nwhere in the clouded vault of heaven is that one mist-wreath which is\nshe?' And Genji answered: 'Since she whom once we knew beyond the\ncountry of the clouds is fled, two months of storm and darkness now\nhave seared the wintry earth below.'\nThe depth of Genji's feeling was evident. Sometimes Ch\u016bj\u014d had\nthought it was merely dread of the old Emperor's rebukes\u2014coupled with\na sense of obligation towards Aoi's father whose kindness had always\nbeen so marked and also towards the Princess her mother, who had\ncherished him with an unfailing patience and fondness\u2014that had made it\ndifficult for him to break off a relationship which was in fact\nbecoming very irksome. Often indeed Genji's apparent indifference to\nAoi had been very painful to him. Now it was evident to him that she\nhad never ceased to hold an important place in his affections, and\nthis made him deplore more bitterly than ever the tragedy of her early\ndeath. Whatever he did and wherever he went he felt that a light was\ngone out of his life and he was very despondent.\nAmong the withered undergrowth in the garden Genji found to his\ndelight a few gentians still blossoming and after Ch\u016bj\u014d was gone he\nplucked some and bade the wet-nurse Sais\u014d give them to the child's\ngrandmother, together with the verse: 'This gentian flower that\nlingered amid the withered grasses of the hedge I send you in\nremembrance of the autumn that is passed.' 'To you' he added 'it will\nseem a poor thing in contrast to the flowers that are gone.' The\nPrincess looked at her grandson's innocent smiling face and thought\nthat in beauty he was not far behind the child she had lost. Already\nher tears were pouring faster than a stormy wind shakes down the dry\nleaves from a tree, and when she read Genji's message they flowed\nfaster still. This was her answer: 'New tears, but tears of joy it\nbrings,\u2014this blossom from a meadow that is now laid waste.'\nStill in need of some small employment to distract his thoughts,\nthough it was already getting dark he began a letter to Princess\nAsagao who, he felt sure, must long ago have been told of his\nbereavement. Although it was a long time since he had heard from her\nhe made no reference to their former friendship; his letter was indeed\nso formal that he allowed the messenger to read it before he\nstarted. It was written on Chinese paper tinted sky-blue. With it was\nthe poem 'When I look back upon an autumn fraught with diverse sorrows\nI find no dusk dimmed with such tears as I to-night have shed.' He\ntook great pains with his handwriting and her ladies thought it a\nshame that so elegant a note should remain unanswered. In the end she\nreached the same conclusion. 'Though my heart goes out towards you in\nyour affliction,' she answered, 'I see no cause to abandon my\ndistrust.' And to this she added the poem 'Since I heard that the\nmists of autumn had vanished and left desolate winter in your house, I\nhave thought often of you as I watched the streaming sky.' This was\nall, and it was written hastily, but to Genji, who for so long had\nreceived no news from her, it gave as much pleasure as the longest and\nmost ingenious epistle.",

            "text": "It is in general the unexplored that attracts us, and Genji tended to\nfall most deeply in love with those who gave him least encouragement.\nThe ideal condition for the continuance of his affection was that the\nbeloved, much occupied elsewhere, should grant him no more than an\noccasional favour. There was one[25] who admirably fulfilled these\nconditions, but unfortunately her high rank and conspicuous position\nin society brought with them too many material difficulties. But\nlittle Murasaki was different. There was no need to bring her up on\nthis principle. He had not during the long days of his mourning ever\nforgotten her and he knew that she must be feeling very dull without\nhim. But he regarded her merely as an orphan child whose care he had\nundertaken and it was a comfort to him to think that here at least was\nsomeone he could leave for a little while without anxiously wondering\nall the time whether he would get into trouble.\nIt was now quite dark, and gathering the people of the house round the\ngreat lamp he got them to tell him stories. There was among them a\ngentlewoman named Ch\u016bnagon with whom he had for years been secretly in\nlove. He still felt drawn towards her, but at such a time there could\nof course be no thought of any closer tie. Seeing now that he was\nlooking despondent she came over to him and when they had talked for a\nwhile of various matters at large, Genji said to her: 'During these\nlast weeks, when all has been quiet in the house, I have grown so used\nto the company of you gentlewomen that if a time comes when we can no\nlonger meet so frequently, I shall miss you very much. That was why I\nwas feeling particularly depressed; though indeed whichever way I turn\nmy thoughts I find small matter for consolation!' Here he paused and\nsome of the ladies shed a few tears. At last one of them said: 'I\nknow, my Lord, how dark a cloud has fallen upon your life and would\nnot venture to compare our sorrow with yours. But I would have you\nremember what it must mean to us that henceforward you will never....'\n'Do not say never' answered Genji kindly. 'I do not forget my friends\nso easily as that. If there are any among you who, mindful of the\npast, wish still to serve in this house, they may count upon it that\nso long as I live I shall never desert them.' And as he sat gazing\ninto the lamplight, with tears a-glitter in his eyes, they felt they\nwere fortunate indeed in having such a protector.\nThere was among these gentlewomen a little orphan girl who had been\nAoi's favourite among all her maids. Well knowing how desolate the\nchild must now be feeling he said to her kindly: 'Whose business is it\nnow but mine to look after little Miss At\u00e9?' The girl burst into\ntears. In her short tunic, darker than the dresses the others were\nwearing, with black neckerchief and dark blue breeches she was a\ncharming figure. 'I hope' continued Genji 'that there are some who\ndespite the dull times they are likely to have in this house will\nchoose, in memory of the past, to devote themselves to the care of the\nlittle prince whom I am leaving behind. If all who knew his mother are\nnow to be dispersed his plight will be more wretched than before.'\nAgain he promised never to forget them, but they knew well enough that\nhis visits would be few and far between, and felt very despondent.\nThat night he distributed among these waiting-ladies and among all the\nservants at the Great Hall according to their rank and condition\nvarious keepsakes and trifles that had belonged to their young\nmistress, giving to each whatever he thought most likely to keep her\nmemory alive, without regard to his own preferences and dislikes in\nthe household.\nHe had determined that he could not much longer continue this mode of\nlife and must soon return to his own palace. While his servants were\ndragging out his coach and his gentlemen assembling in front of his\nrooms, as though on purpose to delay him a violent rainstorm began,\nwith a wind that tore the last leaves from the trees and swept them\nover the earth with wild rapidity. The gentlemen who had assembled in\nfront of the house were soon drenched to the skin. He had meant to go\nto the Palace, then to the Nij\u014d-in and return to sleep at the Great\nHall. But on such a night this was impossible, and he ordered his\ngentlemen to proceed straight to the Nij\u014d-in where he would join them\nsubsequently. As they trooped off each of them felt (though none of\nthem was likely to be seeing the Great Hall for by any means the last\ntime) that to-day a chapter in his life was closed. Both the Minister\nand his wife, when they heard that Genji was not returning that night,\nalso felt that they had reached a new and bitter stage in the progress\nof their affliction. To Aoi's mother he sent this letter: 'The\nex-Emperor has expressed a strong desire to see me and I feel bound to\ngo to the Palace. Though I shall not be absent for many days, yet it\nis now so long a time since I left this house that I feel dazed at the\nprospect of facing the great world once more. I could not go without\ninforming you of my departure, but am in no condition to pay you a\nvisit.' The Princess was still lying with closed eyes, her thoughts\nburied in the profoundest gloom. She did not send a reply. Presently\nAoi's father came to Genji's apartments. He found it very hard to bear\nup, and during the interview clung fast to his son-in-law's sleeve\nwith an air of dependence which was pathetic to witness. After much\nhesitation he began at last to say: 'We old men are prone to tears\neven when small matters are amiss; you must not wonder then that under\nthe weight of so terrible a sorrow I sometimes find myself breaking\ninto fits of weeping which I am at a loss to control. At such moments\nof weakness and disarray I had rather be where none can see me, and\nthat is why I have not as yet ventured even to pay my respects to his\nMajesty your good father. If opportunity offers, I beg you to explain\nthis to him. To be left thus desolate in the last years of life is a\nsore trial, a very sore trial indeed....' The effort which it cost him\nto say these words was distressing for Genji to watch and he hastened\nto assure the old Minister that he would make matters right at the\nCourt. 'Though I do not doubt,' he added, 'that my father has already\nguessed the reason of your absence.' As it was still raining heavily\nthe Minister urged him to start before it grew quite dark. But Genji\nwould not leave the house till he had taken a last look at the inner\nrooms. His father-in-law followed him. In the space beyond Aoi's\ncurtained seat, packed away behind a screen, some thirty gentlewomen\nall clad in dark grey weeds were huddled together, forlorn and tearful.\n'These hapless ladies,' said the Minister, turning to Genji,\n'though they take some comfort in the thought that you are leaving\nbehind you one whose presence will sometimes draw you to this house,\nwell know that it will never again be your rightful home, and this\ndistresses them no less than the loss of their dear mistress. For\nyears they had hoped against hope that you and she would at last be\nreconciled. Consider then how bitter for them must be the day of this,\nyour final departure.' 'Let them take heart' said Genji; 'for whereas\nwhile my lady was alive I would often of set purpose absent myself\nfrom her in the vain hope that upon my return I should find her less\nharshly disposed towards me, now that she is dead I have no longer any\ncause to shun this house, as soon you shall discover.'\nWhen he had watched Genji drive away, Aoi's father went to her\nbedroom. All her things were just as she had left them. On a stand in\nfront of the bed writing materials lay scattered about. There were\nsome papers covered with Genji's handwriting, and these the old man\nclasped with an eagerness that made some of the gentlewomen who had\nfollowed him smile even in the midst of their grief. The works that\nGenji had written out were all masterpieces of the past, some Chinese,\nsome Japanese; some written in cursive, some in full script; they\nconstituted indeed an astonishing display of versatile penmanship. The\nMinister gazed with an almost religious awe at these specimens of\nGenji's skill, and the thought that he must henceforth regard the\nyoung man whom he adored as no longer a member of his household and\nfamily must at that moment have been very painful to him.\nAmong these manuscripts was a copy of Po Ch\u00fc-i's \"Everlasting\nWrong\"[26] and beside the words 'The old pillow, the old coverlet\nwith whom shall he now share?' Genji had written the poem: 'Mournful\nher ghost that journeying now to unfamiliar realms must flee the couch\nwhere we were wont to rest.' While beside the words 'The white petals\nof the frost' he had written: 'The dust shall cover this bed; for no\nlonger can I bear to brush from it the nightly dew of my tears.'\nAoi's ladies were gathered together in groups of two or three in each\nof which some gentlewoman was pouring out her private griefs and\nvexations. 'No doubt, as his Excellency the Minister told us, Prince\nGenji will come to us sometimes, if only to see the child. But for my\npart I doubt whether he will find much comfort in such visits....' So\none of them was saying to her friends. And soon there were many\naffecting scenes of farewell between them, for it had been decided\nthat for the present they were all of them to go back to their homes.\nMeanwhile Genji was with his father in the Palace. 'You are very thin\nin the face,' said the ex-Emperor as soon as he saw him. 'I am afraid\nyou have overtaxed your strength by too much prayer and fasting,' and\nin a state of the deepest concern he at once began pressing all kinds\nof viands and cordials upon him, showing with regard to his health and\nindeed his affairs in general a solicitude by which Genji could not\nhelp feeling touched.\nLate that night he at last arrived at the Nij\u014d-in. Here he found\neverything garnished and swept; his men-servants and maids were\nwaiting for him at the door. All the gentlewomen of the household at\nonce presented themselves in his apartments. They seemed to have vied\nwith one another which should look the gayest and smartest, and their\nfinery contrasted pleasantly with the sombre and dispiriting attire of\nthe unfortunate ladies whom he had left behind him at the Great Hall.\nHaving changed out of his court dress, he went at once to the western\nwing. Not only was Murasaki's winter costume most daintily designed,\nbut her pretty waiting-maids and little companions were so handsomely\nequipped as to reflect the greatest credit on Sh\u014dnagon's management;\nand he saw with satisfaction that such matters might with perfect\nsafety be left in her hands. Murasaki herself was indeed exquisitely\ndressed. 'How tall you have grown since last I saw you!' he said and\npulled up her little curtain-of-honour. He had been away so long that\nshe felt shy with him and turned her head aside. But he would not for\nthe world have had her look otherwise than she looked at that moment,\nfor as she sat in profile with the lamplight falling upon her face he\nrealized with delight that she was becoming the very image of her whom\nfrom the beginning he had loved best. Coming closer to her side he\nwhispered to her: 'Some time or other I want to tell you about all\nthat has been happening to me since I went away. But it has all been\nvery terrible and I am too tired to speak of it now, so I am going\naway to rest for a little while in my own room. From to-morrow onwards\nyou will have me to yourself all day long; in fact, I expect you will\nsoon grow quite tired of me.'\n'So far, so good' thought Sh\u014dnagon when she heard this speech. But she\nwas still very far from easy in her mind. She knew that there were\nseveral ladies of very great influence with whom Genji was on terms of\nfriendship and she feared that when it came to choosing a second wife,\nhe would be far more likely to take one of these than to remember her\nown little mistress; and she was not at all satisfied.\nWhen Genji had retired to the eastern wing, he sent for a certain Lady\nCh\u016bj\u014d to rub his limbs and then went to bed. Next morning he wrote to\nthe nurses of Aoi's child and received from them in reply a touching\naccount of its beauty and progress; but the letter served only to\nawaken in him useless memories and regrets. Towards the end of the day\nhe felt very restless and the time hung heavily on his hands, but he\nwas in no mood to resume his secret rovings and such an idea did not\neven occur to him. In Murasaki none of his hopes had been\ndisappointed; she had indeed grown up into as handsome a girl as you\ncould wish to see, nor was she any longer at an age when it was\nimpossible for him to become her lover. He constantly hinted at this,\nbut she did not seem to understand what he meant.\nHe still had plenty of time on his hands, and the whole of it was now\nspent in her society. All day long they played together at draughts or\nword-picking, and even in the course of these trivial pursuits she\nshowed a quickness of mind and beauty of disposition which continually\ndelighted him; but she had been brought up in such rigid seclusion\nfrom the world that it never once occurred to her to exploit her",

Her attendants had no means of\nknowing that anything out of the ordinary had happened, for it had\nalways been Genji's habit to go in and out of her room just as he\nchose. They naturally assumed that she was not feeling well and were\nglancing at her with sympathy when Genji arrived carrying a\nwriting-box which he slipped behind the bed curtains. He at once\nretired, and the ladies also left the room. Seeing that she was alone\nMurasaki slowly raised her head. There by her pillow was the\nwriting-box and tied to it with ribbon, a slender note. Listlessly she\ndetached the note and unfolding it read the hastily scribbled poem:\n'Too long have we deferred this new emprise, who night by night\ntill now have lain but with a shift between.'\nThat _this_ was what Genji had so long been wanting came to her as a\ncomplete surprise and she could not think why he should regard the\nunpleasant thing that had happened last night as in some way the\nbeginning of a new and more intimate friendship between them. Later in\nthe morning he came again. 'Is something the matter with you?' he\nasked. 'I shall be very dull to-day if you cannot play draughts with\nme.' But when he came close to her she only buried herself more deeply\nthan ever under the bedclothes. He waited till the room was empty and\nthen bending over her he said 'Why are you treating me in this surly\nway? I little expected to find you in so bad a humour this morning.\nThe others will think it very strange if you lie here all day,' and he\npulled aside the scarlet coverlet beneath which she had dived. To his\nastonishment he found that she was bathed in sweat; even the hair that\nhung across her cheeks was dripping wet. 'No! This is too much,' he\nsaid; 'what a state you have worked yourself up into!' But try as he\nwould to coax her back to reason he could not get a word out of her,\nfor she was really feeling very vexed with him indeed. 'Very well\nthen,' he said at last, 'if that is how you feel I will never come to\nsee you again,' and he pretended to be very much mortified and\nhumiliated. Turning away, he opened the writing-box to see whether she\nhad written any answer to his poem, but of course found none. He\nunderstood perfectly that her distress was due merely to extreme youth\nand inexperience, and was not at all put out. All day long he sat near\nher trying to win back her confidence, and though he had small success\nhe found even her rebuffs in a curious way very endearing.\nAt nightfall, it being the Day of the Wild Boar, the festival\ncakes[27] were served. Owing to Genji's bereavement no great display\nwas made, but a few were brought round to Murasaki's quarters in an\nelegant picnic-basket. Seeing that the different kinds were all mixed\nup together Genji came out into the front part of the house and\ncalling for Koremitsu said to him: 'I want you to take these cakes\naway and bring me some more to-morrow evening; only not nearly so many\nas this, and all of one kind.[28] This is not the right evening for\nthem.' He smiled as he said these words and Koremitsu was quick-witted\nenough at once to guess what had happened. He did not however think\nthat it would be discreet to congratulate his master in so many words,\nand merely said: 'It is true enough that if you want to make a good\nbeginning you must eat your cakes on the proper day. The day of the\nRat is certainly very much to the purpose.[29] Pray how many am I to\nbring?' When Genji answered 'Divide by three[30] and you will get the\nanswer,' Koremitsu was no longer in any doubt, and hastily retired,\nleaving Genji amused at the practised air with which he invariably\nhandled matters of this kind. He said nothing to anyone, but returning\nto his private house made the cakes there with his own hands.\nGenji was beginning to despair of ever restoring her confidence and\ngood humour. But even now, when she seemed as shy of him as on\nthe night when he first stole her from her home, her beauty fascinated\nhim and he knew that his love for her in past days had been but a\nparticle compared with what he had felt since yesterday.\nHow strange a thing is the heart of man! For now it would have seemed\nto him a calamity if even for a single night he had been taken from\nMurasaki's side; and only a little while ago....\nKoremitsu brought the cakes which Genji had ordered very late on the\nfollowing night. He was careful not to entrust them to Sh\u014dnagon, for\nhe thought that such a commission might embarrass a grown woman.\nInstead, he sent for her daughter Miss Ben and putting all the cakes\ninto one large perfume-box he bade her take them secretly to her\nmistress. 'Be sure to put them close by her pillow, for they are lucky\ncakes and must not be left about the house. Promise me not to do\nanything silly with them.' Miss Ben thought all this very odd, but\ntossing her head she answered 'When, pray, did you ever know me to be\nsilly,' and she walked off with the box. Being quite a young girl and\ncompletely innocent as regards matters of this kind she marched\nstraight up to her mistress's bed and, remembering Koremitsu's\ninstructions, pushed the box through the curtains and lodged it safely\nby the pillow. It seemed to her that there was someone else there as\nwell as Murasaki. 'No doubt,' thought she 'Prince Genji has come as\nusual to hear her repeat her lessons.'\nAs yet no one in the household save Koremitsu had any knowledge of the\nbetrothal. But when next day the box was found by the bed and brought\ninto the servant's quarters some of those who were in closest touch\nwith their master's affairs at once guessed the secret. Where did\nthese little dishes come from, each set on its own little carved\nstand? and who had been at such pains to make these dainty and\ningenious cakes? Sh\u014dnagon, though she was shocked at this casual way\nof slipping into matrimony, was overjoyed to learn that Genji's\nstrange patronage of her young mistress had at last culminated in a\ndefinite act of betrothal, and her eyes brimmed with tears of\nthankfulness and delight. All the same, she thought he might at least\nhave taken the trouble to inform her old nurse, and there was a good\ndeal of grumbling in the household generally at an outside retainer\nsuch as Koremitsu having got wind of the matter first.\nDuring the days that followed he grudged even the short hours of",

            "text": "attendance which he was obliged to put in at the Palace and in his\nfather's rooms, discovering (much to his own surprise) that save in\nher presence he could no longer enjoy a moment's peace. The friends\nwhom he had been wont to visit showed themselves both surprised and\noffended by this unexplained neglect, but though he had no wish to\nstand ill with them he now found that even a remote prospect of having\nto absent himself from his palace for a single night was enough to\nthrow him quite out of gear; and all the time he was away his spirits\nwere at the very lowest ebb and he looked for all the world as though\nhe were sickening from some strange illness. To all invitations or\ngreetings he invariably replied that he was at present in no fit mood\nfor company (which was naturally taken as an allusion to his recent\nloss) or that he must now be gone, for someone with whom he had\nbusiness was already awaiting him.\nThe Minister of the Right was aware that his youngest daughter[31] was\nstill pining for Prince Genji and he said one day to Princess K\u014dkiden:\n'While his wife was alive we were bound of course to discourage her\nfriendship with him in every way we could. But the position is now\nquite changed and I feel that as things are there would be much\nto be said for such a match.' But K\u014dkiden had always hated Genji and\nhaving herself arranged that her sister should enter the Palace,[32]\nshe saw no reason why this plan should suddenly be abandoned. Indeed\nfrom this moment onwards she became obstinately determined that the\ngirl should be given to the Emperor and to no one else. Genji indeed\nstill retained a certain partiality towards her; but though it grieved\nhim to hear that he had made her unhappy he had not at present any\nspare affection to offer her. Life, he had come to the conclusion, was\nnot long enough for diversions and experiments; henceforward he would\nconcentrate. He had moreover received a terrible warning of the\ndangers which might accrue from such jealousies and resentments as his\nformer way of life had involved. He thought with great tenderness and\nconcern of Lady Rokuj\u014d's distress; but it was clear to him that he\nmust beware of ever again allowing her to regard him as her true haven\nof refuge. If however she would renew their friendship in quite new\nterms, permitting him to enjoy her company and conversation at such\ntimes as he could conveniently arrange to do so, he saw no reason why\nthey should not sometimes meet.\nSociety at large knew that someone was living with him, but her\nidentity was quite unknown. This was of no consequence; but Genji felt\nthat sooner or later he ought to let her father Prince Hy\u014dbuky\u014d know\nwhat had become of her and decided that before he did so it would be\nbest to celebrate her Initiation. This was done privately, but he was\nat pains that every detail of the ceremony should be performed with\ndue splendour and solemnity, and though the outside world was not\ninvited it was as magnificent an affair as it well could be. But ever\nsince their betrothal Murasaki had shown a certain shyness and\ndiffidence in his presence. She could not help feeling sorry that\nafter all the years during which they had got on so well together and\nbeen such close friends he should suddenly take this strange idea into\nhis head, and whenever her eyes met his she hastily averted them. He\ntried to make a joke of the matter, but to her it was very serious\nindeed and weighed heavily upon her mind. Her changed attitude towards\nhim was indeed somewhat comic; but it was also very distressing, and\none day he said: 'Sometimes it seems as though you had forgotten all\nthe long years of our friendship and I had suddenly become as new to\nyou as at the start'; and while thus he scolded her the year drew to a\nclose. On New Year's Day he paid the usual visits of ceremony to his\nfather, to the Emperor and to the Heir Apparent. Next he visited the\nGreat Hall. The old Minister made no reference to the new year, but at\nonce began to speak of the past. In the midst of his loneliness and\nsorrow he was so deeply moved even by this hasty and long deferred\nvisit that though he strove hard to keep his composure it was more\nthan he could compass to do. Looking fondly at his son-in-law he\nthought that the passage of each fresh year did but add new beauty to\nthis fair face. They went together into the inner rooms, where his\nentry surprised and delighted beyond measure the disconsolate ladies\nwho had remained behind. Next they visited the little prince who was\ngrowing into a fine child; his merry face was indeed a pleasure to\nsee. His resemblance to the Heir Apparent was certainly very striking\nand Genji wondered whether it had been noticed.\nAoi's things were still as she had left them. His New Year clothes had\nas in former years been hung out for him on the clothes-frame. Aoi's\nclothes-frame which stood empty beside it wore a strangely desolate\nair. A letter from the Princess her mother was now brought to him:\n'To-day,' she said, 'our bereavement was more than ever present\nto my mind, and though touched at the news of your visit, I fear that\nto see you would but awaken unhappy recollections.' 'You will\nremember,' she continued, 'that it was my custom to present you with a\nsuit of clothes on each New Year's Day. But in these last months my\nsight has been so dimmed with tears that I fear you will think I have\nmatched the colours very ill. Nevertheless I beg that though it be for\nto-day only you will suffer yourself to be disfigured by this\nunfashionable garb ...' and a servant held out before him a second[33]\nsuit, which was evidently the one he was expected to wear to-day. The\nunder-stuff was of a most unusual pattern and mixture of colours and\ndid not at all please him; but he could not allow her to feel that she\nhad laboured in vain, and at once put the suit on. It was indeed\nfortunate that he had come to the Great Hall that day, for he could\nsee that she had counted on it. In his reply he said: 'Though I came\nwith the hope that you would be the first friend I should greet at\nthis new springtide, yet now that I am here too many bitter memories\nassail me and I think it wiser that we should not meet.' To this he\nadded an acrostic poem in which he said that with the mourning dress\nwhich he had just discarded so many years of friendship were cast\naside that were he to come to her[34] he could but weep. To this she\nsent in answer an acrostic poem in which she said that in this new\nseason when all things else on earth put on altered hue, one thing\nalone remained as in the months gone by\u2014her longing for the child who\nlike the passing year had vanished from their sight.",
