I know with what zeal the spud is used; how large\\nLINE 95: bare places are regarded with delight; how seed is scattered over them,\\nLINE 96: which the birds watch with cunning glances from the neighbouring shrubs\\nLINE 97: and trees, and pounce down upon, as soon as the diligent master of the\\nLINE 98: place, has straightened his aching back and turned it upon the scene of\\nLINE 99: his labours.\\nLINE 100: The dewy lawn before Fair Acres, with its beautiful mosaic of white and\\nLINE 101: gold, fringed with circles of deepest crimson here and there, would not\\nLINE 102: suit the taste of the conventional gardener of these days; nor would the\\nLINE 103: low, irregular building which overlooked it, be considered an attractive\\nLINE 104: or fitting residence, for the sons and daughters of the small country\\nLINE 105: squire in the ninth decade of the century.\\nLINE 106: But in the second decade, in which my story opens, things were\\nLINE 107: different. The country squire lived a country life. He farmed his own\\nLINE 108: acres, he walked over his own fields; his \\'stock\\' were individual cows\\nLINE 109: and horses to him; he could pat each one and call it by its name. His\\nLINE 110: house was his home, and the restlessness of travel, and longing for\\nLINE 111: excitement had not as yet, for the most part, disturbed either him or\\nLINE 112: his children.\\nLINE 113: Now the resonant steam eagle, as it flies across the country side, seems\\nLINE 114: to call upon the dwellers in rural districts to follow where it leads,\\nLINE 115: and an isolated manorial farm like Fair Acres, and a family like the\\nLINE 116: Falconers who inhabited it, are all but impossible to find nowadays.\\nLINE 117: Nor would we grumble that the stream of Progress bears us all upon its\\nLINE 118: breast with the strong resistless current, of which we are scarcely\\nLINE 119: conscious. The busy rush of life has its brighter side, for there are\\nLINE 120: wider fields of service opened out for our sons, and the selfishness\\nLINE 121: which was apt to spring from a secluded life in the heart of the hills,\\nLINE 122: is counteracted by contact with many men, and many minds. Human sympathy\\nLINE 123: is quickened, and love is drawn forth, and the labourers who long for\\nLINE 124: work in the harvest field have the way made easy for them; tools are put\\nLINE 125: into the hands of our daughters with which they may, if they will, carve\\nLINE 126: their own lot in life, and none can complain now that life is wasted for\\nLINE 127: lack of opportunity, for opportunities start up on every side in this\\nLINE 128: active, zealous, go-a-head age in which we find ourselves.\\nLINE 129: But in spite of all such advantages and due acknowledgment of their\\nLINE 130: value, it is refreshing to turn to quiet and peaceful habitations like\\nLINE 131: Fair Acres, and live again a quieter and less complex life than that\\nLINE 132: which we have grown to believe is necessary in these later times.\\nLINE 133: As the sun threw its level beams from the east across the lawn,\\nLINE 134: thousands of diamond drops sparkled and shimmered in the light, and it\\nLINE 135: touched with radiance the figure of a young girl who was standing by a\\nLINE 136: white gate which led into a copse sloping upward to the crest of a hill,\\nLINE 137: behind the old manor, and crowned by a belt of fir-trees.\\nLINE 138: Joyce had her hand on the latch of the gate, but paused for a moment to\\nLINE 139: look back on the landscape which lay stretched out before her.\\nLINE 140: A peaceful valley was below, where the tower of Fair Acres church rose\\nLINE 141: against a background of trees, now in their first fresh beauty. A few\\nLINE 142: cottages with red roofs clustered round the church, and two or three\\nLINE 143: farms were sprinkled at a farther distance. A rugged outline of hills at\\nLINE 144: a higher level, showed where the Ebbor rocks open out a miniature\\nLINE 145: Cheddar, and on the other side of that little gorge lay the open\\nLINE 146: country, where the city of the deep springs lies, with its noble\\nLINE 147: cathedral, and quaint Close, and stately baronial Palace--the beautiful\\nLINE 148: cathedral village of Wells.\\nLINE 149: Joyce Falconer was looking forth upon life as upon this goodly\\nLINE 150: landscape. She was in the fresh spring-time of seventeen summers. Her\\nLINE 151: father called her Sunshine, and her brothers Birdie; while her mother,\\nLINE 152: who was a plain, practical person, and who indulged in no flights of\\nLINE 153: fancy, would say, \"Joyce is the child\\'s name; and what can suit her\\nLINE 154: better? I don\\'t like nick-names.\"\\nLINE 155: Nevertheless the nick-names held their own, and as Joyce stood by the\\nLINE 156: white gate, a voice was heard resounding from the lawn below:\\nLINE 157: \"Hallo, Sunshine!\"\\nLINE 158: \"Father, come up the hill. It is so lovely this morning.\"\\nLINE 159: The squire advanced with steady, even footsteps. He was a fine, stalwart\\nLINE 160: man, dressed in a stout suit of corduroy, and with leggings buttoned up\\nLINE 161: to his knees. He carried a gun under his arm--more from habit than from\\nLINE 162: any idea of using it just then--and close at his heels walked, with\\nLINE 163: sedate and leisurely bearing, his chief friend and companion, a large\\nLINE 164: retriever, Duke; while two little terriers, Nip and Pip, bustled about\\nLINE 165: in every direction, scenting with their sharp noses, and occasionally\\nLINE 166: turning upon each other to have a playful passage of arms which, though\\nLINE 167: accompanied by ominous growls, meant nothing but fun.\\nLINE 168: \"I am up first to-day, daddy!\" Joyce exclaimed, as she went down the\\nLINE 169: gentle descent and linked her arm in her father\\'s. \"I am first, and is\\nLINE 170: not it beautiful to be alive on such a day?\"\\nLINE 171: The squire paused, and putting his arm round his daughter\\'s waist, he\\nLINE 172: said, looking down at her with eyes of loving pride:\\nLINE 173: \"Beautiful! yes,\" thinking, though he did not say so, that the most\\nLINE 174: beautiful thing in all that beautiful world was his little Sunshine, his\\nLINE 175: darling Joyce.\\nLINE 176: \"I hope the weather will keep fine for the hay,\" he said; \"but the glass\\nLINE 177: went up with a gallop yesterday; still, it looks fair enough this\\nLINE 178: morning.\"\\nLINE 179: \"When are we to begin to cut the grass, daddy?\"\\nLINE 180: \"To-morrow, in the home meadow,\" was the reply. \"I am going into Wells\\nLINE 181: to-day, for the magistrates\\' meeting.\"\\nLINE 182: \"May I come, father?\"\\nLINE 183: \"Well, I\\'ve no objection, if mother has not,\" was the answer. \"You must\\nLINE 184: ask her leave.\"\\nLINE 185: \"I expect she will let me come. She is sure to have some shopping to do;\\nLINE 186: and you don\\'t like commissions at shops, daddy.\"\\nLINE 187: The squire gave a significant shrug of his broad shoulders, and then the\\nLINE 188: two began to thread their way through the copse, and came out at last on\\nLINE 189: the side of the grass-covered hill, up which Joyce skipped with the\\nLINE 190: light step of a young fawn, with Nip and Pip scuffling along with her in\\nLINE 191: the highest glee, while the squire and Duke followed more slowly.\\nLINE 192: As she stood there in the light of the morning, Joyce Falconer was a\\nLINE 193: fair picture of happy, joyous maidenhood. Her figure was lithe and\\nLINE 194: supple, and though I am afraid her lilac cotton frock would be despised\\nLINE 195: as only fit for a maid-servant in these days, it became her well. It was\\nLINE 196: made with a full skirt and a loose body, cut rather low at the neck,\\nLINE 197: with sleeves which were large on the shoulder, gradually tightening to\\nLINE 198: the wrist, and displayed to advantage a well-rounded arm. Joyce\\'s shoes\\nLINE 199: were thick; but though, perhaps, a trifle clumsy, they did not spoil the\\nLINE 200: symmetry of her pretty ankle and high-arched instep. Snowy \"tuckers\" of\\nLINE 201: crimped muslin were sewn into the neck and wrists of her gown, and she\\nLINE 202: wore an apron with a bib; an old-fashioned apron, guiltless of bows or\\nLINE 203: lace.\\nLINE 204: Her abundant chestnut hair was gathered on the top of her small head,\\nLINE 205: and fell in curls on either side of her smooth white brow; not concealed\\nLINE 206: now by the large Dunstable straw bonnet, which was hanging to her arm by\\nLINE 207: the strings, and left the gentle breeze of the morning free, to play\\nLINE 208: amongst the clustering curls, at their own sweet will.\\nLINE 209: Joyce\\'s features were regular, and her complexion rosy and healthy.\\nLINE 210: Indeed, everything about her seemed to tell of youth and the full\\nLINE 211: enjoyment of the gifts which God had given her.\\nLINE 212: \"A perfect little rustic!\" her aunt in the Vicar\\'s close at Wells called\\nLINE 213: her sometimes, and would suggest to her father that a year or two at a\\nLINE 214: \"finishing school\" would be an advantage.\\nLINE 215: But the squire could not bring himself to part from his only daughter,\\nLINE 216: and her education had been, I am afraid, sadly neglected.\\nLINE 217: \"Well, little one,\" Mr. Falconer said, as he seated himself on a rough\\nLINE 218: wooden bench, \"what is this?\" touching the cover of a book that peeped\\nLINE 219: from her apron pocket.\\nLINE 220: \"It is a book, father, Charlotte lent me: Mrs. Hemans\\' poems.\"\\nLINE 221: \"Ah! poetry is a good thing when it is kept in its right place.\"\\nLINE 222: \"I have been learning a long poem called \\'Edith,\\' and I repeat it when I\\nLINE 223: am darning stockings, picking up a stitch for every word. Don\\'t you\\nLINE 224: understand, father?\"\\nLINE 225: \"I never darned a stocking,\" he said, laughing.\\nLINE 226: \"Ah! happy father! Mother has now given me six pairs of Melville\\'s new\\nLINE 227: socks, to strengthen the heels. In and out, in and out with the long\\nLINE 228: needle; I have to try very hard not to grumble, so I say \\'Edith\\' as a\\nLINE 229: comfort, and to help me on.\"\\nLINE 230: \\'The woods--oh! solemn are the boundless woods\\nLINE 231: Of the great Western world when day declines,\\nLINE 232: And louder sounds the roll of distant floods,\\nLINE 233: More deep the rustling of the solemn pines;\\nLINE 234: When darkness gathers o\\'er the stilly air,\\nLINE 235: And mystery seems o\\'er every leaf to brood,\\nLINE 236: Awful it is for human heart to bear\\nLINE 237: The weight and burden of the solitude.\\'\\nLINE 238: \"Father,\" she said, suddenly stopping, \"you are thinking of something\\nLINE 239: that troubles you. I know it by the deep line on your forehead, between\\nLINE 240: your eyes. May I know, father?\"\\nLINE 241: \"Well, Sunshine, I am troubled about Melville; he wants to go and see\\nLINE 242: the world, he says. I have given him as good an education as befits his\\nLINE 243: station in life. He has made little use of it; and the bills for the\\nLINE 244: last term at Oxford have been enormous.\"\\nLINE 245: \"How shameful!\" Joyce exclaimed.\\nLINE 246: \"Things are so different from what they were when I was a boy,\" the\\nLINE 247: squire said. \"Why, I never dreamed of anything beyond doing my duty\\nLINE 248: here. I took the farming business off your grandfather\\'s shoulders\\nLINE 249: before I was five-and-twenty. I was his steward, as Melville ought to be\\nLINE 250: mine, and leave me free. As it is, I have to pay Watson, and look into\\nLINE 251: everything myself, when I have a son of three-and-twenty, who ought to\\nLINE 252: do all this for me. I suppose it can\\'t be helped,\" the squire said,\\nLINE 253: stretching out his legs, and taking up the gun which had been resting\\nLINE 254: against the bench, \"and as far as I can see the younger boys will be\\nLINE 255: very little, if any, better than Melville.\"\\nLINE 256: \"Oh! yes, father. Ralph will do anything you wish, I know; and Hal and\\nLINE 257: Bunny are very good at school. Remember what the master said of them at\\nLINE 258: Christmas.\"\\nLINE 259: \"Yes, yes; they are good little fellows. Then there is poor Piers; he\\nLINE 260: must always be an anxiety, poor boy!\"\\nLINE 261: \"I don\\'t think any of us can be happier than Piers,\" Joyce said. \"He\\nLINE 262: never complains because he is lame; and he is as contented as possible,\\nLINE 263: making his collection of moths and butterflies, and bird\\'s eggs, and\\nLINE 264: things. No, father, don\\'t be unhappy about Piers.\"\\nLINE 265: \"Do you think, Joyce, I ever forget that it was my carelessness which\\nLINE 266: made the boy a cripple? I never forget it.\"\\nLINE 267: \"No one else thinks of it, dear daddy,\" Joyce said, slipping her hand\\nLINE 268: into her father\\'s, as it rested on his knee. \"No one else thinks of it;\\nLINE 269: and you know the colt had been broken in, and----\"\\nLINE 270: \"The child ought never to have put his legs across it, Joyce; and I\\nLINE 271: lifted him on, and told him not to be a coward. Ah!\" said the squire,\\nLINE 272: suddenly starting to his feet. \"I cannot speak of it; I dare not.\"\\nLINE 273: He began an abrupt descent the way that they had come. Nip and Pip, who\\nLINE 274: had been sleeping with their noses on their paws, and one eye open,\\nLINE 275: raced off, while Duke drew himself into a standing position, and walked\\nLINE 276: demurely down the steep bit of turf, with the brush of his tail waving\\nLINE 277: from side to side as he went.\\nLINE 278: Joyce did not follow immediately. Her bright face was clouded with the\\nLINE 279: sympathy she felt for her father. It all came back to her: the group\\nLINE 280: before the Manor, the child of eight years old, saying, \"I am afraid of\\nLINE 281: riding Rioter, father.\" Then the father\\'s answer, \"Afraid! Don\\'t be a\\nLINE 282: coward, Piers; you have a good seat enough for such a little chap. Here,\\nLINE 283: let me put you on.\" The boy\\'s white, set face, as he grasped the reins;\\nLINE 284: and Rioter was off like lightning. \"His brothers rode long before they\\nLINE 285: were his age,\" the squire had said; \"it won\\'t do to tie him to his\\nLINE 286: mother\\'s apron strings, because he happens to be the youngest.\" Then the\\nLINE 287: sound of returning horse\\'s feet, and Rioter rushed up the side drive to\\nLINE 288: the stables riderless. Another minute and old Thomas appeared with a\\nLINE 289: lifeless burden in his arms, which the squire took from him, with a\\nLINE 290: groan of remorse, as he turned into the house with him and said to his\\nLINE 291: wife, \"I have killed the boy.\"\\nLINE 292: But Piers was not killed. His injuries were life-long, but his life was\\nLINE 293: spared.\\nLINE 294: Whether it was from an instinctive feeling, that his father considered\\nLINE 295: himself the cause of his lameness and generally invalided condition, or\\nLINE 296: whether the latent buoyancy of his nature asserted itself above all the\\nLINE 297: privations which the accident had brought upon him, or whether both of\\nLINE 298: these causes were at work within him, certain it is that Piers was the\\nLINE 299: most cheerful and most uncomplaining member of the squire\\'s household,\\nLINE 300: and never allowed any one to pity him, or to treat him as an object of\\nLINE 301: compassion. Joyce was right when she said that no one was happier than\\nLINE 302: Piers. Every bird and insect had a charm for him, and were his friends\\nLINE 303: and companions. Books of natural history were rare; but Bewick\\'s Birds\\nLINE 304: sufficed for Piers\\' needs. The \"Natural History of Selborne\" and old\\nLINE 305: Isaak Walton\\'s \"Angler\" were also amongst the boy\\'s scanty library, and\\nLINE 306: keen perception and acute observation supplied the place of extraneous\\nLINE 307: help; and Piers was content.\\nLINE 308: The cloud soon cleared from Joyce\\'s face as a well-known whistle was\\nLINE 309: heard from the copse, and Joyce answered it with a clear note of\\nLINE 310: welcome:\\nLINE 311: \"Here, Piers.\"\\nLINE 312: Then the quick, even thud of crutches, and Piers came in sight.\\nLINE 313: In a moment Joyce was springing down the grassy hill-side, and, with a\\nLINE 314: hardly perceptible touch on her brother\\'s shoulder, she joined him as he\\nLINE 315: came up.\\nLINE 316: \"I say, Joyce, if you go to Wells to-day with father, will you take this\\nLINE 317: little sparrow-hawk to old Plume\\'s to be stuffed? Here, rummage in my\\nLINE 318: pocket, left-hand side--there he is! He is a perfect specimen, and a\\nLINE 319: pretty rare one. The stable-boy found him lying on his back under the\\nLINE 320: dove-cot. Perhaps he got the worst of it in a fight. Anyhow, he is dead,\\nLINE 321: and I have a nice nook for him in my big case.\"\\nLINE 322: \"Poor dear little birdie,\" Joyce said, stroking the soft feathers. \"Oh!\\nLINE 323: Piers, why must everything die? It seems so hard. And this is the\\nLINE 324: puzzle, that we--you and I--may die to-day, next week, any day; and yet\\nLINE 325: we don\\'t really behave as if we believed it. I feel on a morning like\\nLINE 326: this, for instance, so full of life, it is so delicious to live, and as\\nLINE 327: if I never could die. It is so beautiful to be living, so sad to be\\nLINE 328: dead! To think, Piers, of this little bird singing sweetly----\"\\nLINE 329: \"Sparrow-hawks don\\'t sing very sweetly; they chirrup and whistle,\" Piers\\nLINE 330: interrupted.\\nLINE 331: \"Ah, well, he thought he sang sweetly, and so did his mother; so it came\\nLINE 332: to the same thing. Poor little sweet.\" And Joyce held the little\\nLINE 333: lifeless bird against her rounded chin and pressed her lips upon it.\\nLINE 334: Suddenly Piers said:\\nLINE 335: \"What is wrong about Melville; there\\'s something fresh, for I heard my\\nLINE 336: mother talking about it before I was up.\"\\nLINE 337: \"He says he won\\'t come here and take care of the farm. He wants to\\nLINE 338: travel.\"\\nLINE 339: \"Well, I don\\'t blame him for that,\" said Piers.\\nLINE 340: \"But his debts have hampered father dreadfully I know, and he does so\\nLINE 341: detest his fine gentleman airs. It seems to me,\" said Joyce, vehemently,\\nLINE 342: \"to be ashamed of a father like ours is--Oh! I have no word bad enough,\\nLINE 343: and Melville _is_ ashamed, and he does not like mother looking after the\\nLINE 344: dairy and the butter.\"\\nLINE 345: \"Well,\" said Piers, tapping his crutch upon the ground, \"I think mother\\nLINE 346: does fidget and worry too much in the house and about the place; but it\\nLINE 347: is her way, and no one could alter it.\"\\nLINE 348: \"I don\\'t know that I wish to alter it,\" Joyce said, hotly. \"Mother has\\nLINE 349: done so much for us, and I hate to think she is slighted by her\\nLINE 350: children. Melville _does_ slight her, and when he talks in that\\nLINE 351: drawling, affected voice, and ties his starched cravats twenty times,\\nLINE 352: and flings them down again if the bow is crooked. I despise _him_, and\\nLINE 353: that is the truth.\"\\nLINE 354: Piers shrugged his shoulders.\\nLINE 355: \"Well, we must go back to breakfast,\" he said; \"I am hungry, and it must\\nLINE 356: be nearly eight o\\'clock.\"\\nLINE 357: The brother and sister walked slowly towards the house, and as they\\nLINE 358: crossed the lawn, from which the sun had kissed away all the dewdrops, a\\nLINE 359: bell over the stables rang, and a little alert figure appeared in the\\nLINE 360: porch.\\nLINE 361: \"Joyce, Joyce! What are you dawdling for? It is past eight o\\'clock.\\nLINE 362: Getting your feet drenched with the dew, I\\'ll warrant. No, don\\'t bring\\nLINE 363: any dead birds here, Piers; I won\\'t have it. The house is just like a\\nLINE 364: pigsty with all your rubbish. Take it round to the back kitchen. I have\\nLINE 365: a pretty hard morning\\'s work before me, and you must lend a hand, Joyce,\\nLINE 366: I can tell you.\"\\nLINE 367: \"Father said I was to go with him to Wells, mother, and do your\\nLINE 368: shopping.\"\\nLINE 369: \"Well, that won\\'t be till eleven o\\'clock. There\\'s time enough first to\\nLINE 370: help me to give out the stores and get the linen aired for the boys\\'\\nLINE 371: room and the spare bedroom, and you forget, I suppose, that your\\nLINE 372: brothers are coming home for the holidays on Friday, and this is\\nLINE 373: Wednesday. I shall be all behindhand, if I don\\'t look out. I wish\\nLINE 374: Melville\\'s fine gentleman visitor farther!\"\\nLINE 375: Mrs. Falconer spoke rapidly, and in rather a high key. Her accent was\\nLINE 376: decidedly provincial, and she did not measure out her words with the\\nLINE 377: slow precision which her eldest son Melville considered a mark of _bon\\nLINE 378: ton_.\\nLINE 379: Mrs. Falconer was the daughter of a large farmer in a neighbouring\\nLINE 380: county, and the squire had married her in haste, though he had never\\nLINE 381: repented at leisure.\\nLINE 382: She was thoroughly loyal-hearted and true as a wife and mother; brusque\\nLINE 383: and blunt, holding all fine things and fine people in supreme contempt.\\nLINE 384: And yet, according to the perversity of women-kind, she spoiled and\\nLINE 385: indulged the son whose love of fine things seemed likely to be his bane,\\nLINE 386: and brought perpetual trouble upon his good and honourable father.\\nLINE 387: To make bread and cakes, to skim milk, churn butter, at a pinch, and\\nLINE 388: make all the sweet, cooling drinks for the summer, and elderberry wine\\nLINE 389: for the winter, were domestic duties in which Mrs. Falconer gloried. She\\nLINE 390: would put on a large apron and a pair of dusting-gloves every morning\\nLINE 391: and go the round of the parlours, and rub the old mahogany chair-backs\\nLINE 392: and bureau with vigour, sprinkle the tea-leaves on stated days, and\\nLINE 393: follow one of her stout maid-servants, as they swept the carpets on\\nLINE 394: their knees, with dustpan and brush, and remove every suspicion of\\nLINE 395: \"fluff\" from every corner or crevice where it might be supposed to\\nLINE 396: accumulate.\\nLINE 397: While her children were young these household duties which their mother\\nLINE 398: took upon herself, were considered as a matter of course, but with added\\nLINE 399: years came added wisdom, to some of them at least, and Melville, her\\nLINE 400: eldest son, and her great darling and idol, began to show unmistakable\\nLINE 401: signs of annoyance, at his mother\\'s household accomplishments.\\nLINE 402: He was at home now, and a stormy scene the night before had deepened the\\nLINE 403: lines on the squire\\'s brow; and hard things Melville had said were as\\nLINE 404: sharp swords to his mother\\'s soul. She was not particularly sensitive,\\nLINE 405: it is true; by no means thin-skinned, or laying herself out--as is the\\nLINE 406: fashion of some women of her temperament, to take offence. Still,\\nLINE 407: Melville had succeeded the night before in wounding her in her tenderest\\nLINE 408: place, reminding her that while his father\\'s pedigree could be stretched\\nLINE 409: out to meet the royal blood of the Saxon kings, the race of sturdy\\nLINE 410: yeomen, from which his mother came, had no blue blood in their veins and\\nLINE 411: were sons of the soil.\\nLINE 412: There is an old saying that \"sharper than a serpent\\'s tooth is an\\nLINE 413: ungrateful child;\" and Mrs. Falconer was still smarting from the wound\\nLINE 414: given her the evening before, when she began to dispense the excellent\\nLINE 415: breakfast, laid in a large, cool hall at the back of the manor, which\\nLINE 416: was connected, by a square opening in the thick wall, with the kitchen.\\nLINE 417: The squire, who was generally so jovial and cheery, ate his cold pressed\\nLINE 418: beef and drank his glass of \"home-brew\" in silence. He professed to be\\nLINE 419: engrossed with a Bath paper several days old, and did not invite\\nLINE 420: conversation.\\nLINE 421: Piers played with some bread-and-milk his mother set before him: his\\nLINE 422: appetite was never good; but Joyce despatched hot rolls and ham with a\\nLINE 423: great appetite, which I am afraid would shock some of our modern notions\\nLINE 424: nowadays.\\nLINE 425: Tea and coffee were not the staple beverages at breakfast in those\\nLINE 426: times; but when the heavier part of the meal was over Joyce handed her\\nLINE 427: father a fragrant cup, with some thin toast done to a turn, for which\\nLINE 428: Mrs. Falconer called from the kitchen through the window, communicating\\nLINE 429: with it, and fitted with a sliding shutter, which was promptly closed\\nLINE 430: when the tray had been received from the hands of one of the maids.\\nLINE 431: \"So you are thinking of going into Wells to-day, Arthur?\" Mrs. Falconer\\nLINE 432: said when, breakfast drawing to a conclusion, she began to pile the\\nLINE 433: plates together, and put all the scraps on one, for the benefit of Nip\\nLINE 434: and Pip, who had been lying in the window-seat for the past half-hour in\\nLINE 435: a state of suppressed excitement, with their noses on their paws, and\\nLINE 436: their eyes fixed upon that end of the table where their mistress\\nLINE 437: presided.\\nLINE 438: The noise made by the piling up of the plates was now a decided\\nLINE 439: movement, and Nip and Pip began to wriggle and leap, and finally subside\\nLINE 440: on their hind legs as Joyce called out: \"Trust, Nip! trust, Pip!\" and\\nLINE 441: then, after what she considered a due time spent in an erect position,\\nLINE 442: the plate was put down before them, and its contents vanished in a\\nLINE 443: twinkling.\\nLINE 444: \"Well, Joyce, will you be ready by eleven o\\'clock?\" Mr. Falconer asked\\nLINE 445: as he left the room.\\nLINE 446: Joyce was silent, and her mother said:\\nLINE 447: \"Yes, yes, she shall be ready; if she is brisk she can get through all I\\nLINE 448: want.\" Then Mrs. Falconer began to put all the silver into a wooden\\nLINE 449: bowl, and rubbed it herself with the washleather when it was dried.\\nLINE 450: She had just finished this part of her daily routine when the door\\nLINE 451: opened and her son Melville came in. His appearance would be ridiculous\\nLINE 452: in the eyes of the dandies of to-day, but in his own, at least, it was\\nLINE 453: as near perfection as possible.\\nLINE 454: His hair was curled in tight and very-much-oiled curls on his forehead\\nLINE 455: and round his ears. He wore a high neckcloth, tied evidently with much\\nLINE 456: care, supporting his retreating chin. His coat was of Lincoln green,\\nLINE 457: very short in the waist, with large silver buttons, and turned back with\\nLINE 458: a wide collar to display two waistcoats, the white one only showing an\\nLINE 459: edge beyond the darker one of deep salmon-colour, which opened to set\\nLINE 460: off a frilled shirt. The trousers were tight, and caught at the ankles\\nLINE 461: by straps, and his shoes were tied with large bows. The servile\\nLINE 462: imitators of \"the first gentleman in Europe\" followed in his steps with\\nLINE 463: as much precision as possible, and Melville Falconer spared no pains to\\nLINE 464: let the county folk of Somersetshire see what the real scion of _bon\\nLINE 465: ton_ looked like.\\nLINE 466: Melville had a pleasant, weak face; he was almost entirely forgetful of\\nLINE 467: the interests or tastes of anyone but himself, and he had never given up\\nLINE 468: his own wishes for the sake of another in his life.\\nLINE 469: He had a ridiculous idea of his own importance, and a supreme contempt\\nLINE 470: for what he called old-fashioned usage; from the vantage-ground of\\nLINE 471: superior wisdom he looked down on the county gentry of Somersetshire,\\nLINE 472: who, in those days, did not frequent London in the season, or tread hard\\nLINE 473: on the heels of the nobility in all their customs, as is now the case.\\nLINE 474: The great mercantile wealth which rose into colossal importance, when\\nLINE 475: railway traffic brought the small towns near the large ones, and the\\nLINE 476: large ones near the metropolis, had not begun to overshadow the land;\\nLINE 477: the tide of speculation had not set in; and there was less hastening to\\nLINE 478: be rich and desire to display all that riches could give. It was a time\\nLINE 479: of comparative stagnation, which preceded the great rush, which was to\\nLINE 480: bear on its tide, as the stream of progress and discovery gathered\\nLINE 481: strength, the next generation with relentless power. Of all that lay\\nLINE 482: outside Fair Acres, Mrs. Falconer was almost indifferent, if not\\nLINE 483: ignorant. She liked things as they were, and was averse to change, lest\\nLINE 484: that change should be for the worse. Her tongue, which was a sharp one,\\nLINE 485: had been swift to condemn the establishment of the schools in her\\nLINE 486: neighbourhood, and she resisted all invitations from her husband to make\\nLINE 487: the acquaintance of Mrs. Hannah More. Teaching lads and lasses to read\\nLINE 488: and write was, in the opinion of Mrs. Falconer, a crying evil. They had\\nLINE 489: enough learning if they kept their church once a week, and as to\\nLINE 490: arithmetic, if they could count their own fingers it was enough; and\\nLINE 491: she, for one, would never take a servant who had schooling. \"A pack of\\nLINE 492: nonsense,\" she called it; and she would tell Mrs. Hannah More so if only\\nLINE 493: she had the chance. Mrs. Falconer turned from her occupation at the\\nLINE 494: table, when her son entered.\\nLINE 495: \"Breakfast!\" she exclaimed. \"No, indeed; breakfast is over and done\\nLINE 496: with. I can\\'t keep the things about half the morning.\"\\nLINE 497: The prototype of the fine gentleman seated himself in a chair at the\\nLINE 498: table, and said in a drawling voice, suppressing a yawn:\\nLINE 499: \"Joyce, get me some clean plates, and go and order a rasher of bacon;\\nLINE 500: and let the eggs be poached; and----\"\\nLINE 501: But Mrs. Falconer pushed Joyce aside:\\nLINE 502: \"No,\" she said; \"your sister has something else to do than wait on you.\\nLINE 503: I\\'ll get your breakfast; and if you have to wait an hour, it will serve\\nLINE 504: you right; lie-a-beds don\\'t generally have sharp appetites.\"\\nLINE 505: \"Nay, mother,\" Melville said, \"do not let the want of appetite be laid\\nLINE 506: to my door, with so many other sins; I am particularly hungry this\\nLINE 507: morning. And I beseech you, do not do servant\\'s work for _me_.\"\\nLINE 508: Mrs. Falconer\\'s face betrayed that she felt the thrust.\\nLINE 509: \"Servant\\'s work must be done for folks too lazy to do it for\\nLINE 510: themselves,\" she said, as she let the heavy door swing behind her, and\\nLINE 511: repaired to the kitchen to prepare, far too carefully, a breakfast for\\nLINE 512: her son.\\nLINE 513: Joyce hesitated a moment, and then said:\\nLINE 514: \"It always vexes mother when you are late, Melville. I wish you would\\nLINE 515: get up earlier.\"\\nLINE 516: \"My dear little sister, I should have vexed mother if I had come down at\\nLINE 517: six. She is out of temper with me, and so is my father, simply because I\\nLINE 518: desire to get a little education, to fit me for my position here, you\\nLINE 519: know, when I come into the place.\"\\nLINE 520: \"Oh, Melville, you have had every advantage; you ought to know\\nLINE 521: everything. But Aunt Letitia was quite right--the money spent upon you\\nLINE 522: at Oxford was wasted.\"\\nLINE 523: \"Thanks for your high opinion. I ought to be vastly grateful for it. But\\nLINE 524: to speak of other things: I have bidden a friend to stay here for a\\nLINE 525: week. He will like country air, and to drink milk and curds-and-whey. He\\nLINE 526: arrives at Wells by the Bath mail; and I shall drive in with you and my\\nLINE 527: father, and hire a post-chaise at the Swan to bring him out.\"\\nLINE 528: \"I hope he is not a fine gentleman,\" Joyce said.\\nLINE 529: \"He is a very fine gentleman indeed,\" was the answer; \"and, Joyce,\\nLINE 530: persuade mother _not_ to put on that big bib, and make herself look like\\nLINE 531: a housekeeper. It will appal Arundel, and make him feel out of his\\nLINE 532: element.\"\\nLINE 533: \"If he is to feel that, what does he come for?\" Joyce said, angrily. \"We\\nLINE 534: want no upstarts here.\"\\nLINE 535: \"Upstarts! that is fine talking. Arundel comes of one of the oldest\\nLINE 536: families in England. Not older than ours; though, unhappily, we live as\\nLINE 537: if we had sprung from the gutter, and do not get any proper respect.\"\\nLINE 538: \"Respect!\" exclaimed Joyce, indignantly. \"Respect! As if father were not\\nLINE 539: respected as a justice! and as if _you_----\" Joyce stopped; she felt too\\nLINE 540: indignant to go on.\\nLINE 541: \"My dear little sister,\" Melville said, with a grand air of pity--\"my\\nLINE 542: dear little sister, you are only ignorant. If you knew a little more of\\nLINE 543: the habits and customs of the higher classes, you would not talk so\\nLINE 544: foolishly.\"\\nLINE 545: \"I do not wish to know more about them if you have got _your_ habits\\nLINE 546: from associating with them.\"\\nLINE 547: Melville smiled, and did not betray the least irritation.\\nLINE 548: \"My dear,\" he said, \"facts are stubborn things. Does it never strike\\nLINE 549: you, that though my father dines at the houses of the gentry in the\\nLINE 550: county, sits on the bench, and rides to cover, you and my mother are not\\nLINE 551: invited to accompany him. The truth is my good mother dislikes the\\nLINE 552: usages of _genteel_ life.\"\\nLINE 553: Melville used that objectionable word with emphasis. Genteel was in\\nLINE 554: those days used as some of us now use words which are scarcely more\\nLINE 555: significant, though generally accepted--\"Good form,\" \"A 1,\" and so\\nLINE 556: forth.\\nLINE 557: \"It is,\" Melville continued, grandly, \"the result of early associations;\\nLINE 558: and so we eat heavy one o\\'clock meals and nine o\\'clock suppers, instead\\nLINE 559: of dining at three or four o\\'clock; and my mother, instead of receiving\\nLINE 560: company in the house, works in it like a servant. It is a vast pity, my\\nLINE 561: dear. It keeps the family down, and destroys your chances in life. So I\\nLINE 562: advise you to try to alter things. Now Arundel is coming, I want to dine\\nLINE 563: at a less outlandish hour, and I----\"\\nLINE 564: Whatever Mr. Melville Falconer wanted Joyce did not stay to hear. She\\nLINE 565: left the large hall by one door as her mother entered by the other,\\nLINE 566: bearing in her hand a tray of delicately prepared breakfast for her\\nLINE 567: son, who was wholly unworthy of her attentions, and would have been\\nLINE 568: better without them.\\nLINE 569: \"Thank you, mother,\" Melville said. \"I hope the toast is not dried up.\\nLINE 570: There is so much skill even in the poaching of an egg.\"\\nLINE 571: \"There are two ways of doing everything,\" was Mrs. Falconer\\'s rejoinder.\\nLINE 572: \"Now I must be quick, for I have a deal of work upstairs.\"\\nLINE 573: \"Why should you have work, mother?\"\\nLINE 574: \"Why did you invite a fine gentleman here? You had better answer that\\nLINE 575: question. The best room must be got ready, and the feather bed laid\\nLINE 576: before the fire.\"\\nLINE 577: \"A fire in this weather!\" exclaimed Melville.\\nLINE 578: \"No one ever sleeps in my house in an unaired bed; and never will, while\\nLINE 579: I am mistress of it, that I can tell you. I hope your fine gentleman is\\nLINE 580: not one to scoff at plain people.\"\\nLINE 581: \"Arundel is far too well bred to make invidious remarks. But for all\\nLINE 582: that, things may strike him as a little odd. I was going to suggest that\\nLINE 583: we should dine at four o\\'clock while he is here, and that the boys\\nLINE 584: should not sit down with us elders. It is not the custom in great\\nLINE 585: houses.\"\\nLINE 586: \"It is the custom here, and mine is _not_ a great house: it is a\\nLINE 587: comfortable English home, where there is no waste, and no extravagance,\\nLINE 588: and no show. I\\'ll warrant your grand friend never slept in a better bed\\nLINE 589: nor between finer sheets than he will to-night. They are as sweet as\\nLINE 590: lavender can make them, and----\"\\nLINE 591: Melville shrugged his shoulders.\\nLINE 592: \"Nay, spare me, mother, and let us leave the arrangements of\\nLINE 593: bed-chambers to the fitting people. And, if I might suggest it, let all\\nLINE 594: things wear their best appearance when Arundel arrives, including the\\nLINE 595: mistress of the mansion. It is a pity when one so young and\\nLINE 596: comely-looking as my mother should pay such scant heed to the little\\nLINE 597: feminine ornaments which are----Phaugh! what is this? Positively a red\\nLINE 598: ant crawling from the bread-trencher. What a beast! Quick! catch it,\\nLINE 599: mother. I hope we shall have no red ants when Arundel is here.\"\\nLINE 600: Mrs. Falconer darted down upon the ant with her forefinger, and speedily\\nLINE 601: despatched it, exclaiming there was a perfect plague of ants in the\\nLINE 602: larder, and she did not know how to be rid of them.\\nLINE 603: \"Disgusting!\" said her son, carefully covering the body of the ant with\\nLINE 604: a leaf which had garnished the pat of butter. \"It is enough to make one\\nLINE 605: sick. I must have a little brandy to settle myself, or rather, my\\nLINE 606: breakfast, before I start.\"\\nLINE 607: Mrs. Falconer made no response to this request. But the spirit-stand was\\nLINE 608: in the sideboard, and when his mother was gone Melville helped himself\\nLINE 609: to a pretty strong dram, and then lounged about till it was time to\\nLINE 610: mount the \"four-wheel\" and drive into Wells.\\nLINE 611: [Illustration]'"

       "   'text': 'The Pool of Tears\\n\"Curiouser and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \"now I\\'m\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\"\\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\nsight, they were getting so far off). \"Oh, my poor little feet, I\\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\\'m\\nsure _I_ shan\\'t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\\nkind to them,\" thought Alice, \"or perhaps they won\\'t walk the way I\\nwant to go! Let me see: I\\'ll give them a new pair of boots every\\nChristmas.\"\\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \"They must\\ngo by the carrier,\" she thought; \"and how funny it\\'ll seem, sending\\npresents to one\\'s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\\n_Alice\\'s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\\nAlice\\'s love_).\\nOh dear, what nonsense I\\'m talking!\"\\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" said Alice, \"a great girl like\\nyou,\" (she might well say this), \"to go on crying in this way! Stop\\nthis moment, I tell you!\" But she went on all the same, shedding\\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \"Oh! the Duchess, the\\nDuchess! Oh! won\\'t she be savage if I\\'ve kept her waiting!\" Alice felt\\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you please,\\nsir—\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \"Dear, dear! How\\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\\nI wonder if I\\'ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\\na little different. But if I\\'m not the same, the next question is, Who\\nin the world am I? Ah, _that\\'s_ the great puzzle!\" And she began\\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\n\"I\\'m sure I\\'m not Ada,\" she said, \"for her hair goes in such long\\nringlets, and mine doesn\\'t go in ringlets at all; and I\\'m sure I can\\'t\\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\\nvery little! Besides, _she\\'s_ she, and _I\\'m_ I, and—oh dear, how\\npuzzling it all is! I\\'ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\\'t signify: let\\'s try\\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\\nRome, and Rome—no, _that\\'s_ all wrong, I\\'m certain! I must have been\\nchanged for Mabel! I\\'ll try and say \\'_How doth the little_—\\'\" and she\\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\\n\"How doth the little crocodile\\nImprove his shining tail,\\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\\nOn every golden scale!\\n\"How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\nHow neatly spread his claws,\\nAnd welcome little fishes in\\nWith gently smiling jaws!\"\\n\"I\\'m sure those are not the right words,\" said poor Alice, and her eyes\\nfilled with tears again as she went on, \"I must be Mabel after all, and\\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\\'ve\\nmade up my mind about it; if I\\'m Mabel, I\\'ll stay down here! It\\'ll be\\nno use their putting their heads down and saying \\'Come up again, dear!\\'\\nI shall only look up and say \\'Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\\nthen, if I like being that person, I\\'ll come up: if not, I\\'ll stay down\\nhere till I\\'m somebody else\\'—but, oh dear!\" cried Alice, with a sudden\\nburst of tears, \"I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!\"\\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit\\'s little white kid gloves while\\nshe was talking. \"How _can_ I have done that?\" she thought. \"I must be\\ngrowing small again.\" She got up and went to the table to measure\\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\n\"That _was_ a narrow escape!\" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \"and\\nnow for the garden!\" and she ran with all speed back to the little\\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, \"and things are worse than\\never,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this\\nbefore, never! And I declare it\\'s too bad, that it is!\"\\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, \"and in that case I can go back by\\nrailway,\" she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\\nshe was nine feet high.\\n\"I wish I hadn\\'t cried so much!\" said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\nto find her way out. \"I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.\"\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\nslipped in like herself.\\n\"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse?\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there\\'s no harm in trying.\" So she\\nbegan: \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\" (Alice thought this must be the right\\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\nshe remembered having seen in her brother\\'s Latin Grammar, \"A mouse—of\\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!\") The Mouse looked at her rather\\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\nbut it said nothing.\\n\"Perhaps it doesn\\'t understand English,\" thought Alice; \"I daresay it\\'s\\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" (For, with all\\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \"Où est ma chatte?\" which\\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\\nfright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\\nhad hurt the poor animal\\'s feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn\\'t like\\ncats.\"\\n\"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would\\n_you_ like cats if you were me?\"\\n\"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone: \"don\\'t be angry\\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\\'d\\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\\nquiet thing,\" Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\\nin the pool, \"and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\\nnurse—and she\\'s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\\npardon!\" cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \"We won\\'t talk\\nabout her any more if you\\'d rather not.\"\\n\"We indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\ntail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\\'t let me hear the name\\nagain!\"\\n\"I won\\'t indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\nconversation. \"Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?\" The Mouse did not\\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: \"There is such a nice little dog near\\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\\'ll fetch things when\\nyou throw them, and it\\'ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\nof things—I can\\'t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\\nknow, and he says it\\'s so useful, it\\'s worth a hundred pounds! He says\\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\\n\"I\\'m afraid I\\'ve offended it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away\\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\\npool as it went.\\nSo she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\nwon\\'t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\\'t like them!\" When the\\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\ntrembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore, and then I\\'ll tell you my\\nhistory, and you\\'ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.

She went on growing, and growing,\\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \"Now I\\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?\"\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room',\n",

Alice heard it say to itself \"Then I\\'ll\\ngo round and get in at the window.\"\\n\"_That_ you won\\'t!\" thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit\\'s—\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And\\nthen a voice she had never heard before, \"Sure then I\\'m here! Digging\\nfor apples, yer honour!\"\\n\"Digging for apples, indeed!\" said the Rabbit angrily. \"Here! Come and\\nhelp me out of _this!_\" (Sounds of more broken glass.)\\n\"Now tell me, Pat, what\\'s that in the window?\"\\n\"Sure, it\\'s an arm, yer honour!\" (He pronounced it \"arrum.\")\\n\"An arm, you goose!

This time there were\\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \"What a number\\nof cucumber-frames there must be!\" thought Alice. \"I wonder what\\nthey\\'ll do next!

Alice replied,\\nrather shyly, \"I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\nchanged several times since then.\"\\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said the Caterpillar sternly. \"Explain\\nyourself!\"\\n\"I can\\'t explain _myself_, I\\'m afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I\\'m\\nnot myself, you see.\"\\n\"I don\\'t see,\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\"I\\'m afraid I can\\'t put it more clearly,\" Alice replied very politely,\\n\"for I can\\'t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.\"\\n\"It isn\\'t,\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\"Well, perhaps you haven\\'t found it so yet,\" said Alice; \"but when you\\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you\\'ll feel it a little\\nqueer, won\\'t you?\"\\n\"Not a bit,\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\" said Alice; \"all I know\\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.\"\\n\"You!\" said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \"Who are _you?_\"\\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\\'s making such _very_\\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \"I\\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\"\\n\"Why?\" said the Caterpillar.\\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\\nstate of mind, she turned away.\\n\"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \"I\\'ve something\\nimportant to say!\"\\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\\n\"Keep your temper,\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\ncould.\\n\"No,\" said the Caterpillar.\\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you\\nthink you\\'re changed, do you?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid I am, sir,\" said Alice; \"I can\\'t remember things as I\\nused—and I don\\'t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\"\\n\"Can\\'t remember _what_ things?\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\"Well, I\\'ve tried to say \"How doth the little busy bee,\" but it all\\ncame different!\" Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\n\"Repeat, \"_You are old, Father William_,\\'\" said the Caterpillar.\\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\\n\"You are old, Father William,\" the young man said,\\n\"And your hair has become very white;\\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?\"\\n\"In my youth,\" Father William replied to his son,\\n\"I feared it might injure the brain;\\nBut, now that I\\'m perfectly sure I have none,\\nWhy, I do it again and again.\"\\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"as I mentioned before,\\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat;\\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\\nPray, what is the reason of that?\"\\n\"In my youth,\" said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\\n\"I kept all my limbs very supple\\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\"\\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"and your jaws are too weak\\nFor anything tougher than suet;\\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\\nPray, how did you manage to do it?\"\\n\"In my youth,\" said his father, \"I took to the law,\\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\"\\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"one would hardly suppose\\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\"\\n\"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\"\\nSaid his father; \"don\\'t give yourself airs!\\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\\nBe off, or I\\'ll kick you down stairs!\"\\n\"That is not said right,\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\"Not _quite_ right, I\\'m afraid,\" said Alice, timidly; \"some of the\\nwords have got altered.\"\\n\"It is wrong from beginning to end,\" said the Caterpillar decidedly,\\nand there was silence for some minutes.\\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\n\"What size do you want to be?\" it asked.\\n\"Oh, I\\'m not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied; \"only one\\ndoesn\\'t like changing so often, you know.\"\\n\"I _don\\'t_ know,\" said the Caterpillar.\\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\n\"Are you content now?\" said the Caterpillar.\\n\"Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn\\'t\\nmind,\" said Alice: \"three inches is such a wretched height to be.\"\\n\"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the Caterpillar angrily,\\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\n\"But I\\'m not used to it!\" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\\nthought of herself, \"I wish the creatures wouldn\\'t be so easily\\noffended!\"\\n\"You\\'ll get used to it in time,\" said the Caterpillar; and it put the\\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\\n\"One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\\ngrow shorter.\"\\n\"One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_\" thought Alice to\\nherself.\\n\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\\n\"And now which is which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\nlefthand bit.\\n* * * * * * *\\n* * * * * *\\n* * * * * * *\\n\"Come, my head\\'s free at last!\" said Alice in a tone of delight, which\\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\n\"What _can_ all that green stuff be?\" said Alice. \"And where _have_ my\\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\\'t see you?\"\\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\\n\"Serpent!\" screamed the Pigeon.\\n\"I\\'m _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly. \"Let me alone!\"\\n\"Serpent, I say again!\" repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, \"I\\'ve tried every way, and nothing\\nseems to suit them!\"\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea what you\\'re talking about,\" said Alice.\\n\"I\\'ve tried the roots of trees, and I\\'ve tried banks, and I\\'ve tried\\nhedges,\" the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \"but those\\nserpents! There\\'s no pleasing them!\"\\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\n\"As if it wasn\\'t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon;\\n\"but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\\nhaven\\'t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\"\\n\"I\\'m very sorry you\\'ve been annoyed,\" said Alice, who was beginning to\\nsee its meaning.\\n\"And just as I\\'d taken the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the\\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I\\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\"\\n\"But I\\'m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I\\'m a—I\\'m a—\"\\n\"Well! _What_ are you?\" said the Pigeon. \"I can see you\\'re trying to\\ninvent something!\"\\n\"I—I\\'m a little girl,\" said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\\n\"A likely story indeed!\" said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\ncontempt. \"I\\'ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You\\'re a serpent; and there\\'s\\nno use denying it. I suppose you\\'ll be telling me next that you never\\ntasted an egg!\"\\n\"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\" said Alice, who was a very truthful\\nchild; \"but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\nknow.\"\\n\"I don\\'t believe it,\" said the Pigeon; \"but if they do, why then\\nthey\\'re a kind of serpent, that\\'s all I can say.\"\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \"You\\'re\\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\\nme whether you\\'re a little girl or a serpent?\"\\n\"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I\\'m not\\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\\'t want\\n_yours_: I don\\'t like them raw.\"\\n\"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\\nand began talking to herself, as usual. \"Come, there\\'s half my plan\\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\\'m never sure what I\\'m\\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I\\'ve got back to my\\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly\\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\\n\"Whoever lives there,\" thought Alice, \"it\\'ll never do to come upon them\\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\" So she\\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.',\n",

It was opened by\\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the\\nQueen to play croquet.\" The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, \"From the Queen.\\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\"\\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\n\"There\\'s no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that for\\ntwo reasons. First, because I\\'m on the same side of the door as you\\nare; secondly, because they\\'re making such a noise inside, no one could\\npossibly hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\\npieces.\\n\"Please, then,\" said Alice, \"how am I to get in?\"\\n\"There might be some sense in your knocking,\" the Footman went on\\nwithout attending to her, \"if we had the door between us. For instance,\\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\\nknow.\" He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \"But perhaps he can\\'t help it,\"\\nshe said to herself; \"his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?\"\\nshe repeated, aloud.\\n\"I shall sit here,\" the Footman remarked, \"till tomorrow—\"\\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\\nskimming out, straight at the Footman\\'s head: it just grazed his nose,\\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\n\"—or next day, maybe,\" the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\\nas if nothing had happened.\\n\"How am I to get in?\" asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\n\"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That\\'s the first\\nquestion, you know.\"\\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \"It\\'s really\\ndreadful,\" she muttered to herself, \"the way all the creatures argue.\\nIt\\'s enough to drive one crazy!\"\\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\nremark, with variations. \"I shall sit here,\" he said, \"on and off, for\\ndays and days.\"\\n\"But what am _I_ to do?\" said Alice.\\n\"Anything you like,\" said the Footman, and began whistling.\\n\"Oh, there\\'s no use in talking to him,\" said Alice desperately: \"he\\'s\\nperfectly idiotic!\" And she opened the door and went in.',\n",

Even the Duchess sneezed\\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\nalternately without a moment\\'s pause. The only things in the kitchen\\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\n\"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \"why\\nyour cat grins like that?\"\\n\"It\\'s a Cheshire cat,\" said the Duchess, \"and that\\'s why. Pig!\"\\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\\n\"I didn\\'t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\\'t\\nknow that cats _could_ grin.\"\\n\"They all can,\" said the Duchess; \"and most of \\'em do.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know of any that do,\" Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\npleased to have got into a conversation.\\n\"You don\\'t know much,\" said the Duchess; \"and that\\'s a fact.\"\\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\n\"Oh, _please_ mind what you\\'re doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and down\\nin an agony of terror. \"Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!\" as an\\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\\noff.\\n\"If everybody minded their own business,\" the Duchess said in a hoarse\\ngrowl, \"the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\"\\n\"Which would _not_ be an advantage,\" said Alice, who felt very glad to\\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \"Just\\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—\"\\n\"Talking of axes,\" said the Duchess, \"chop off her head!\"\\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\nbe listening, so she went on again: \"Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\\nis it twelve? I—\"\\n\"Oh, don\\'t bother _me_,\" said the Duchess; \"I never could abide\\nfigures!\" And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\\nthe end of every line:\\n\"Speak roughly to your little boy,\\nAnd beat him when he sneezes:\\nHe only does it to annoy,\\nBecause he knows it teases.\"\\nCHORUS.\\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:—\\n\"I speak severely to my boy,\\nI beat him when he sneezes;\\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\\nThe pepper when he pleases!\"\\nCHORUS.\\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\\n\"Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice,\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play\\ncroquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room.

       "   'text': 'A Mad Tea-Party\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \"Very\\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\" thought Alice; \"only, as it\\'s asleep,\\nI suppose it doesn\\'t mind.\"\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it: \"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw\\nAlice coming. \"There\\'s _plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and\\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\"Have some wine,\" the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\n\"I don\\'t see any wine,\" she remarked.\\n\"There isn\\'t any,\" said the March Hare.\\n\"Then it wasn\\'t very civil of you to offer it,\" said Alice angrily.\\n\"It wasn\\'t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\" said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\"I didn\\'t know it was _your_ table,\" said Alice; \"it\\'s laid for a great\\nmany more than three.\"\\n\"Your hair wants cutting,\" said the Hatter. He had been looking at\\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\\nspeech.\\n\"You should learn not to make personal remarks,\" Alice said with some\\nseverity; \"it\\'s very rude.\"\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\\nwas, \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"\\n\"Come, we shall have some fun now!\" thought Alice. \"I\\'m glad they\\'ve\\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,\" she added aloud.\\n\"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\"Exactly so,\" said Alice.\\n\"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.\\n\"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least—at least I mean what I\\nsay—that\\'s the same thing, you know.\"\\n\"Not the same thing a bit!\" said the Hatter. \"You might just as well\\nsay that \\'I see what I eat\\' is the same thing as \\'I eat what I see\\'!\"\\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the March Hare, \"that \\'I like what\\nI get\\' is the same thing as \\'I get what I like\\'!\"\\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\ntalking in his sleep, \"that \\'I breathe when I sleep\\' is the same thing\\nas \\'I sleep when I breathe\\'!\"\\n\"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and here the\\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\\nwriting-desks, which wasn\\'t much.\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \"What day of the month\\nis it?\" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\nand holding it to his ear.\\nAlice considered a little, and then said \"The fourth.\"\\n\"Two days wrong!\" sighed the Hatter. \"I told you butter wouldn\\'t suit\\nthe works!\" he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\n\"It was the _best_ butter,\" the March Hare meekly replied.\\n\"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\" the Hatter grumbled:\\n\"you shouldn\\'t have put it in with the bread-knife.\"\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \"It was the _best_ butter,\\nyou know.\"\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \"What a\\nfunny watch!\" she remarked. \"It tells the day of the month, and doesn\\'t\\ntell what o\\'clock it is!\"\\n\"Why should it?\" muttered the Hatter. \"Does _your_ watch tell you what\\nyear it is?\"\\n\"Of course not,\" Alice replied very readily: \"but that\\'s because it\\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\"\\n\"Which is just the case with _mine_,\" said the Hatter.\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\\'s remark seemed to have no\\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \"I don\\'t quite\\nunderstand you,\" she said, as politely as she could.\\n\"The Dormouse is asleep again,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\nhot tea upon its nose.\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\neyes, \"Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\"\\n\"Have you guessed the riddle yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\nagain.\\n\"No, I give it up,\" Alice replied: \"what\\'s the answer?\"\\n\"I haven\\'t the slightest idea,\" said the Hatter.\\n\"Nor I,\" said the March Hare.\\nAlice sighed wearily. \"I think you might do something better with the\\ntime,\" she said, \"than waste it in asking riddles that have no\\nanswers.\"\\n\"If you knew Time as well as I do,\" said the Hatter, \"you wouldn\\'t talk\\nabout wasting _it_. It\\'s _him_.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean,\" said Alice.\\n\"Of course you don\\'t!\" the Hatter said, tossing his head\\ncontemptuously. \"I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\"\\n\"Perhaps not,\" Alice cautiously replied: \"but I know I have to beat\\ntime when I learn music.\"\\n\"Ah! that accounts for it,\" said the Hatter. \"He won\\'t stand beating.\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\\'d do almost anything\\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\\'clock in\\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you\\'d only have to whisper a\\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\\ntime for dinner!\"\\n(\"I only wish it was,\" the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\\n\"That would be grand, certainly,\" said Alice thoughtfully: \"but then—I\\nshouldn\\'t be hungry for it, you know.\"\\n\"Not at first, perhaps,\" said the Hatter: \"but you could keep it to\\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.\"\\n\"Is that the way _you_ manage?\" Alice asked.\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \"Not I!\" he replied. \"We\\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—\" (pointing\\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \"—it was at the great concert\\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\n\\'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\nHow I wonder what you\\'re at!\\'\\nYou know the song, perhaps?\"\\n\"I\\'ve heard something like it,\" said Alice.\\n\"It goes on, you know,\" the Hatter continued, \"in this way:—\\n\\'Up above the world you fly,\\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\\nTwinkle, twinkle—\\'\"\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\\n\"_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—\" and went on so long that they\\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\\n\"Well, I\\'d hardly finished the first verse,\" said the Hatter, \"when the\\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, \\'He\\'s murdering the time! Off with his\\nhead!\\'\"\\n\"How dreadfully savage!\" exclaimed Alice.\\n\"And ever since that,\" the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \"he won\\'t\\ndo a thing I ask! It\\'s always six o\\'clock now.\"\\nA bright idea came into Alice\\'s head. \"Is that the reason so many\\ntea-things are put out here?\" she asked.\\n\"Yes, that\\'s it,\" said the Hatter with a sigh: \"it\\'s always tea-time,\\nand we\\'ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\"\\n\"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\" said Alice.\\n\"Exactly so,\" said the Hatter: \"as the things get used up.\"\\n\"But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\" Alice ventured\\nto ask.\\n\"Suppose we change the subject,\" the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\n\"I\\'m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t know one,\" said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\nproposal.\\n\"Then the Dormouse shall!\" they both cried. \"Wake up, Dormouse!\" And\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \"I wasn\\'t asleep,\" he said in a\\nhoarse, feeble voice: \"I heard every word you fellows were saying.\"\\n\"Tell us a story!\" said the March Hare.\\n\"Yes, please do!\" pleaded Alice.\\n\"And be quick about it,\" added the Hatter, \"or you\\'ll be asleep again\\nbefore it\\'s done.\"\\n\"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\" the Dormouse began\\nin a great hurry; \"and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—\"\\n\"What did they live on?\" said Alice, who always took a great interest\\nin questions of eating and drinking.\\n\"They lived on treacle,\" said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\"They couldn\\'t have done that, you know,\" Alice gently remarked;\\n\"they\\'d have been ill.\"\\n\"So they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"_very_ ill.\"\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \"But\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\\n\"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\"I\\'ve had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can\\'t\\ntake more.\"\\n\"You mean you can\\'t take _less_,\" said the Hatter: \"it\\'s very easy to\\ntake _more_ than nothing.\"\\n\"Nobody asked _your_ opinion,\" said Alice.\\n\"Who\\'s making personal remarks now?\" the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\nrepeated her question. \"Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\nsaid, \"It was a treacle-well.\"\\n\"There\\'s no such thing!\" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\nHatter and the March Hare went \"Sh! sh!\" and the Dormouse sulkily\\nremarked, \"If you can\\'t be civil, you\\'d better finish the story for\\nyourself.\"\\n\"No, please go on!\" Alice said very humbly; \"I won\\'t interrupt again. I\\ndare say there may be _one_.\"\\n\"One, indeed!\" said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\ngo on. \"And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\\nyou know—\"\\n\"What did they draw?\" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\n\"Treacle,\" said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\n\"I want a clean cup,\" interrupted the Hatter: \"let\\'s all move one place\\non.\"\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\\nmoved into the Dormouse\\'s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\ncautiously: \"But I don\\'t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\nfrom?\"\\n\"You can draw water out of a water-well,\" said the Hatter; \"so I should\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?\"\\n\"But they were _in_ the well,\" Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\\nto notice this last remark.\\n\"Of course they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"—well in.\"\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\nsome time without interrupting it.\\n\"They were learning to draw,\" the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \"and they drew all manner of\\nthings—everything that begins with an M—\"\\n\"Why with an M?\" said Alice.\\n\"Why not?\" said the March Hare.\\nAlice was silent.\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\\nlittle shriek, and went on: \"—that begins with an M, such as\\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\\nthings are \"much of a muchness\"—did you ever see such a thing as a\\ndrawing of a muchness?\"\\n\"Really, now you ask me,\" said Alice, very much confused, \"I don\\'t\\nthink—\"\\n\"Then you shouldn\\'t talk,\" said the Hatter.\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\nthe teapot.\\n\"At any rate I\\'ll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice as she picked her\\nway through the wood. \"It\\'s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\\nall my life!\"\\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\nleading right into it. \"That\\'s very curious!\" she thought. \"But\\neverything\\'s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\" And\\nin she went.',\n",

       "   'text': 'The Queen\\'s Croquet-Ground\\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\\none of them say, \"Look out now, Five! Don\\'t go splashing paint over me\\nlike that!\"\\n\"I couldn\\'t help it,\" said Five, in a sulky tone; \"Seven jogged my\\nelbow.\"\\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \"That\\'s right, Five! Always lay the\\nblame on others!\"\\n\"_You\\'d_ better not talk!\" said Five. \"I heard the Queen say only\\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\"\\n\"What for?\" said the one who had spoken first.\\n\"That\\'s none of _your_ business, Two!\" said Seven.\\n\"Yes, it _is_ his business!\" said Five, \"and I\\'ll tell him—it was for\\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\"\\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \"Well, of all the unjust\\nthings—\" when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\\nand all of them bowed low.\\n\"Would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, \"why you are\\npainting those roses?\"\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\\nvoice, \"Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\\nyou see, Miss, we\\'re doing our best, afore she comes, to—\" At this\\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\nout \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners instantly threw\\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\\nthe King\\'s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\nof such a rule at processions; \"and besides, what would be the use of a\\nprocession,\" thought she, \"if people had all to lie down upon their\\nfaces, so that they couldn\\'t see it?\" So she stood still where she was,\\nand waited.\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\nat her, and the Queen said severely \"Who is this?\" She said it to the\\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\n\"Idiot!\" said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\\nAlice, she went on, \"What\\'s your name, child?\"\\n\"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely;\\nbut she added, to herself, \"Why, they\\'re only a pack of cards, after\\nall. I needn\\'t be afraid of them!\"\\n\"And who are _these?_\" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\\n\"How should _I_ know?\" said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \"It\\'s\\nno business of _mine_.\"\\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed \"Off with her head! Off—\"\\n\"Nonsense!\" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\nsilent.\\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \"Consider, my\\ndear: she is only a child!\"\\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \"Turn\\nthem over!\"\\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\n\"Get up!\" said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\\n\"Leave off that!\" screamed the Queen. \"You make me giddy.\" And then,\\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, \"What _have_ you been doing\\nhere?\"\\n\"May it please your Majesty,\" said Two, in a very humble tone, going\\ndown on one knee as he spoke, \"we were trying—\"\\n\"_I_ see!\" said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\n\"Off with their heads!\" and the procession moved on, three of the\\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\\nto Alice for protection.\\n\"You shan\\'t be beheaded!\" said Alice, and she put them into a large\\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\\nothers.\\n\"Are their heads off?\" shouted the Queen.\\n\"Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\" the soldiers shouted\\nin reply.\\n\"That\\'s right!\" shouted the Queen. \"Can you play croquet?\"\\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\\nevidently meant for her.\\n\"Yes!\" shouted Alice.\\n\"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\\nwondering very much what would happen next.\\n\"It\\'s—it\\'s a very fine day!\" said a timid voice at her side. She was\\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\n\"Very,\" said Alice: \"—where\\'s the Duchess?\"\\n\"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \"She\\'s under\\nsentence of execution.\"\\n\"What for?\" said Alice.\\n\"Did you say \\'What a pity!\\'?\" the Rabbit asked.\\n\"No, I didn\\'t,\" said Alice: \"I don\\'t think it\\'s at all a pity. I said\\n\\'What for?\\'\"\\n\"She boxed the Queen\\'s ears—\" the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\\nscream of laughter. \"Oh, hush!\" the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\ntone. \"The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\\nQueen said—\"\\n\"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\nshouting \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a\\nminute.\\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\n\"and then,\" thought she, \"what would become of me? They\\'re dreadfully\\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\\'s any\\none left alive!\"\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\\nto herself \"It\\'s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\\nto.\"\\n\"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\nenough for it to speak with.\\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \"It\\'s no use\\nspeaking to it,\" she thought, \"till its ears have come, or at least one\\nof them.\" In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\n\"I don\\'t think they play at all fairly,\" Alice began, in rather a\\ncomplaining tone, \"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\\'t hear\\noneself speak—and they don\\'t seem to have any rules in particular; at\\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you\\'ve no idea how\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\\'s the\\narch I\\'ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen\\'s hedgehog just now, only\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!\"\\n\"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat in a low voice.\\n\"Not at all,\" said Alice: \"she\\'s so extremely—\" Just then she noticed\\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\n\"—likely to win, that it\\'s hardly worth while finishing the game.\"\\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\n\"Who _are_ you talking to?\" said the King, going up to Alice, and\\nlooking at the Cat\\'s head with great curiosity.\\n\"It\\'s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,\" said Alice: \"allow me to\\nintroduce it.\"\\n\"I don\\'t like the look of it at all,\" said the King: \"however, it may\\nkiss my hand if it likes.\"\\n\"I\\'d rather not,\" the Cat remarked.\\n\"Don\\'t be impertinent,\" said the King, \"and don\\'t look at me like\\nthat!\" He got behind Alice as he spoke.\\n\"A cat may look at a king,\" said Alice. \"I\\'ve read that in some book,\\nbut I don\\'t remember where.\"\\n\"Well, it must be removed,\" said the King very decidedly, and he called\\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, \"My dear! I wish you would\\nhave this cat removed!\"\\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\\nsmall. \"Off with his head!\" she said, without even looking round.\\n\"I\\'ll fetch the executioner myself,\" said the King eagerly, and he\\nhurried off.\\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\non, as she heard the Queen\\'s voice in the distance, screaming with\\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \"but it doesn\\'t\\nmatter much,\" thought Alice, \"as all the arches are gone from this side\\nof the ground.\" So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\nfriend.\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\nwhat they said.\\nThe executioner\\'s argument was, that you couldn\\'t cut off a head unless\\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\\nthing before, and he wasn\\'t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\\nThe King\\'s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\nbeheaded, and that you weren\\'t to talk nonsense.\\nThe Queen\\'s argument was, that if something wasn\\'t done about it in\\nless than no time she\\'d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\\nanxious.)\\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but \"It belongs to the\\nDuchess: you\\'d better ask _her_ about it.\"\\n\"She\\'s in prison,\" the Queen said to the executioner: \"fetch her here.\"\\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\\nThe Cat\\'s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.',\n",

He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\ntwo sobs choked his voice. \"Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\"\\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—\\n\"You may not have lived much under the sea—\" (\"I haven\\'t,\" said\\nAlice)—\"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—\"\\n(Alice began to say \"I once tasted—\" but checked herself hastily, and\\nsaid \"No, never\") \"—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\nLobster Quadrille is!\"\\n\"No, indeed,\" said Alice. \"What sort of a dance is it?\"\\n\"Why,\" said the Gryphon, \"you first form into a line along the\\nsea-shore—\"\\n\"Two lines!\" cried the Mock Turtle. \"Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\\nthen, when you\\'ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—\"\\n\"_That_ generally takes some time,\" interrupted the Gryphon.\\n\"—you advance twice—\"\\n\"Each with a lobster as a partner!\" cried the Gryphon.\\n\"Of course,\" the Mock Turtle said: \"advance twice, set to partners—\"\\n\"—change lobsters, and retire in same order,\" continued the Gryphon.\\n\"Then, you know,\" the Mock Turtle went on, \"you throw the—\"\\n\"The lobsters!\" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\n\"—as far out to sea as you can—\"\\n\"Swim after them!\" screamed the Gryphon.\\n\"Turn a somersault in the sea!\" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\nabout.\\n\"Change lobsters again!\" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\n\"Back to land again, and that\\'s all the first figure,\" said the Mock\\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\\n\"It must be a very pretty dance,\" said Alice timidly.\\n\"Would you like to see a little of it?\" said the Mock Turtle.\\n\"Very much indeed,\" said Alice.\\n\"Come, let\\'s try the first figure!\" said the Mock Turtle to the\\nGryphon. \"We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\"\\n\"Oh, _you_ sing,\" said the Gryphon. \"I\\'ve forgotten the words.\"\\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\nand sadly:—\\n\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\\n\"There\\'s a porpoise close behind us, and he\\'s treading on my tail.\\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\nThey are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\\nWill you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, won\\'t you join the dance?\\n\"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\"\\nBut the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance—\\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\n\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\\n\"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France—\\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\nWill you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, won\\'t you join the dance?\"\\n\"Thank you, it\\'s a very interesting dance to watch,\" said Alice,\\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: \"and I do so like that\\ncurious song about the whiting!\"\\n\"Oh, as to the whiting,\" said the Mock Turtle, \"they—you\\'ve seen them,\\nof course?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Alice, \"I\\'ve often seen them at dinn—\" she checked herself\\nhastily.\\n\"I don\\'t know where Dinn may be,\" said the Mock Turtle, \"but if you\\'ve\\nseen them so often, of course you know what they\\'re like.\"\\n\"I believe so,\" Alice replied thoughtfully. \"They have their tails in\\ntheir mouths—and they\\'re all over crumbs.\"\\n\"You\\'re wrong about the crumbs,\" said the Mock Turtle: \"crumbs would\\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\\nand the reason is—\" here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\\neyes.—\"Tell her about the reason and all that,\" he said to the Gryphon.\\n\"The reason is,\" said the Gryphon, \"that they _would_ go with the\\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\\ncouldn\\'t get them out again. That\\'s all.\"\\n\"Thank you,\" said Alice, \"it\\'s very interesting. I never knew so much\\nabout a whiting before.\"\\n\"I can tell you more than that, if you like,\" said the Gryphon. \"Do you\\nknow why it\\'s called a whiting?\"\\n\"I never thought about it,\" said Alice. \"Why?\"\\n\"_It does the boots and shoes_,\" the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. \"Does the boots and shoes!\" she repeated\\nin a wondering tone.\\n\"Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?\" said the Gryphon. \"I mean, what\\nmakes them so shiny?\"\\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\nanswer. \"They\\'re done with blacking, I believe.\"\\n\"Boots and shoes under the sea,\" the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\n\"are done with a whiting. Now you know.\"\\n\"And what are they made of?\" Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\n\"Soles and eels, of course,\" the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\n\"any shrimp could have told you that.\"\\n\"If I\\'d been the whiting,\" said Alice, whose thoughts were still\\nrunning on the song, \"I\\'d have said to the porpoise, \\'Keep back,\\nplease: we don\\'t want _you_ with us!\\'\"\\n\"They were obliged to have him with them,\" the Mock Turtle said: \"no\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\"\\n\"Wouldn\\'t it really?\" said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\n\"Of course not,\" said the Mock Turtle: \"why, if a fish came to _me_,\\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say \\'With what porpoise?\\'\"\\n\"Don\\'t you mean \\'purpose\\'?\" said Alice.\\n\"I mean what I say,\" the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\\nthe Gryphon added \"Come, let\\'s hear some of _your_ adventures.\"\\n\"I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,\" said\\nAlice a little timidly: \"but it\\'s no use going back to yesterday,\\nbecause I was a different person then.\"\\n\"Explain all that,\" said the Mock Turtle.\\n\"No, no! The adventures first,\" said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\n\"explanations take such a dreadful time.\"\\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\\nabout her repeating \"_You are old, Father William_,\" to the\\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said \"That\\'s very curious.\"\\n\"It\\'s all about as curious as it can be,\" said the Gryphon.\\n\"It all came different!\" the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \"I\\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\\nbegin.\" He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\nauthority over Alice.\\n\"Stand up and repeat \\'\\'_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,\\'\" said the\\nGryphon.\\n\"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\"\\nthought Alice; \"I might as well be at school at once.\" However, she got\\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\nvery queer indeed:—\\n\"\\'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\\n\"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\"\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\\n\"That\\'s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,\" said\\nthe Gryphon.\\n\"Well, I never heard it before,\" said the Mock Turtle; \"but it sounds\\nuncommon nonsense.\"\\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\\n\"I should like to have it explained,\" said the Mock Turtle.\\n\"She can\\'t explain it,\" said the Gryphon hastily. \"Go on with the next\\nverse.\"\\n\"But about his toes?\" the Mock Turtle persisted. \"How _could_ he turn\\nthem out with his nose, you know?\"\\n\"It\\'s the first position in dancing.\" Alice said; but was dreadfully\\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\n\"Go on with the next verse,\" the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \"it\\nbegins \\'_I passed by his garden_.\\'\"\\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—\\n\"I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—\"\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\\nAnd concluded the banquet—]\\n\"What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,\" the Mock Turtle\\ninterrupted, \"if you don\\'t explain it as you go on? It\\'s by far the\\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\"\\n\"Yes, I think you\\'d better leave off,\" said the Gryphon: and Alice was\\nonly too glad to do so.\\n\"Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\" the Gryphon\\nwent on. \"Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\"\\n\"Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\" Alice\\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\\n\"Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \\'_Turtle Soup_,\\' will you, old\\nfellow?\"\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\\nwith sobs, to sing this:—\\n\"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\nBeau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nBeau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\nBeautiful, beautiful Soup!\\n\"Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\\nGame, or any other dish?\\nWho would not give all else for two p\\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\nBeau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nBeau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\nBeautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!\"\\n\"Chorus again!\" cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\\nto repeat it, when a cry of \"The trial\\'s beginning!\" was heard in the\\ndistance.\\n\"Come on!\" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.',\n",

She soon\\ngot it out again, and put it right; \"not that it signifies much,\" she\\nsaid to herself; \"I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\\ntrial one way up as the other.\"\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\ncourt.\\n\"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to Alice.\\n\"Nothing,\" said Alice.\\n\"Nothing _whatever?_\" persisted the King.\\n\"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice.\\n\"That\\'s very important,\" the King said, turning to the jury. They were\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\\nRabbit interrupted: \"_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,\" he\\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\\nhe spoke.\\n\"_Un_important, of course, I meant,\" the King hastily said, and went on\\nto himself in an undertone,\\n\"important—unimportant—unimportant—important—\" as if he were trying\\nwhich word sounded best.\\nSome of the jury wrote it down \"important,\" and some \"unimportant.\"\\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\\n\"but it doesn\\'t matter a bit,\" she thought to herself.\\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\nhis note-book, cackled out \"Silence!\" and read out from his book, \"Rule\\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\"\\nEverybody looked at Alice.\\n\"_I\\'m_ not a mile high,\" said Alice.\\n\"You are,\" said the King.\\n\"Nearly two miles high,\" added the Queen.\\n\"Well, I shan\\'t go, at any rate,\" said Alice: \"besides, that\\'s not a\\nregular rule: you invented it just now.\"\\n\"It\\'s the oldest rule in the book,\" said the King.\\n\"Then it ought to be Number One,\" said Alice.\\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your\\nverdict,\" he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\n\"There\\'s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\" said the\\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \"this paper has just been\\npicked up.\"\\n\"What\\'s in it?\" said the Queen.\\n\"I haven\\'t opened it yet,\" said the White Rabbit, \"but it seems to be a\\nletter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.\"\\n\"It must have been that,\" said the King, \"unless it was written to\\nnobody, which isn\\'t usual, you know.\"\\n\"Who is it directed to?\" said one of the jurymen.\\n\"It isn\\'t directed at all,\" said the White Rabbit; \"in fact, there\\'s\\nnothing written on the _outside_.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\\nand added \"It isn\\'t a letter, after all: it\\'s a set of verses.\"\\n\"Are they in the prisoner\\'s handwriting?\" asked another of the jurymen.\\n\"No, they\\'re not,\" said the White Rabbit, \"and that\\'s the queerest\\nthing about it.\" (The jury all looked puzzled.)\\n\"He must have imitated somebody else\\'s hand,\" said the King. (The jury\\nall brightened up again.)\\n\"Please your Majesty,\" said the Knave, \"I didn\\'t write it, and they\\ncan\\'t prove I did: there\\'s no name signed at the end.\"\\n\"If you didn\\'t sign it,\" said the King, \"that only makes the matter\\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you\\'d have signed\\nyour name like an honest man.\"\\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\nclever thing the King had said that day.\\n\"That _proves_ his guilt,\" said the Queen.\\n\"It proves nothing of the sort!\" said Alice. \"Why, you don\\'t even know\\nwhat they\\'re about!\"\\n\"Read them,\" said the King.\\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \"Where shall I begin, please\\nyour Majesty?\" he asked.\\n\"Begin at the beginning,\" the King said gravely, \"and go on till you\\ncome to the end: then stop.\"\\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:—\\n\"They told me you had been to her,\\nAnd mentioned me to him:\\nShe gave me a good character,\\nBut said I could not swim.\\nHe sent them word I had not gone\\n(We know it to be true):\\nIf she should push the matter on,\\nWhat would become of you?\\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\\nYou gave us three or more;\\nThey all returned from him to you,\\nThough they were mine before.\\nIf I or she should chance to be\\nInvolved in this affair,\\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\\nExactly as we were.\\nMy notion was that you had been\\n(Before she had this fit)\\nAn obstacle that came between\\nHim, and ourselves, and it.\\nDon\\'t let him know she liked them best,\\nFor this must ever be\\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\\nBetween yourself and me.\"\\n\"That\\'s the most important piece of evidence we\\'ve heard yet,\" said the\\nKing, rubbing his hands; \"so now let the jury—\"\\n\"If any one of them can explain it,\" said Alice, (she had grown so\\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn\\'t a bit afraid of\\ninterrupting him,) \"I\\'ll give him sixpence. _I_ don\\'t believe there\\'s\\nan atom of meaning in it.\"\\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, \"_She_ doesn\\'t believe there\\'s\\nan atom of meaning in it,\" but none of them attempted to explain the\\npaper.\\n\"If there\\'s no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that saves a world of\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn\\'t try to find any. And yet I don\\'t\\nknow,\" he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\\nthem with one eye; \"I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\\n\"—_said I could not swim_—\" you can\\'t swim, can you?\" he added, turning\\nto the Knave.\\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. \"Do I look like it?\" he said. (Which he\\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\\n\"All right, so far,\" said the King, and he went on muttering over the\\nverses to himself: \"\\'_We know it to be true_—\\' that\\'s the jury, of\\ncourse—\\'_I gave her one, they gave him two_—\\' why, that must be what he\\ndid with the tarts, you know—\"\\n\"But, it goes on \\'_they all returned from him to you_,\\'\" said Alice.\\n\"Why, there they are!\" said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\\ntarts on the table. \"Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\\nagain—\\'_before she had this fit_—\\' you never had fits, my dear, I\\nthink?\" he said to the Queen.\\n\"Never!\" said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\\nas it lasted.)\\n\"Then the words don\\'t _fit_ you,\" said the King, looking round the\\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\\n\"It\\'s a pun!\" the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\\nlaughed, \"Let the jury consider their verdict,\" the King said, for\\nabout the twentieth time that day.\\n\"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence first—verdict afterwards.\"\\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The idea of having the\\nsentence first!\"\\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, turning purple.\\n\"I won\\'t!\" said Alice.\\n\"Off with her head!\" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\nmoved.\\n\"Who cares for you?\" said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\\nthis time.) \"You\\'re nothing but a pack of cards!\"\\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\n\"Wake up, Alice dear!\" said her sister; \"Why, what a long sleep you\\'ve\\nhad!\"\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve had such a curious dream!\" said Alice, and she told her\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \"It _was_ a curious\\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\\'s getting late.\"\\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.',\n",
