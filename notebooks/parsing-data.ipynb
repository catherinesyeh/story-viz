A single man of large fortune; four\\nor five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\\n\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\n\"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\nsoon as he comes.\"\\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\\nparty.\"\\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\nI do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has\\nfive grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own\\nbeauty.\"\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\nthe neighbourhood.\"\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\\nmerely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\\nhim, if you do not.\"\\n\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\ngood humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the\\npreference.\"\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\nquickness than her sisters.\"\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\nthese twenty years at least.\"\\n\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\\nvisit them.\"\\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\nall.\"\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she\\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.',\n",

He\\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\\npaid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\\nsuddenly addressed her with,\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.\"\\n\"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother\\nresentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\n\"But you forget, mama,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the\\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\"\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.

A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is certainly\\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as\\nshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\\ntake it on myself.\"\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \"Nonsense,\\nnonsense!\"\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried he. \"Do\\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\\nMary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great\\nbooks, and make extracts.\"\\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return to Mr.\\nBingley.\"\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\n\"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I\\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.\\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\\nwhile.\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a\\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said\\na word about it till now.\"\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,\" said Mr. Bennet; and,\\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\\n\"What an excellent father you have, girls,\" said she, when the door was\\nshut. \"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\\nor me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\\npleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but\\nfor your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\\nball.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\nyoungest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\\nreturn Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\\ndinner.',\n",

I hate to see you\\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\\ndance.\"\\n\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it\\nwould be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\\nanother woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to\\nstand up with.\"\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Bingley, \"for a\\nkingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\\nlife, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\\nuncommonly pretty.\"\\n\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr.\\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n\"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\\ndare say, very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round, he looked for a moment at\\nElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,\\n\"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\\nby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story\\nhowever with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\nplayful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her\\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s\\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good\\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\\nbook he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife\\'s\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\\nhad a very different story to hear.\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most\\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well\\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\nher twice. Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her\\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody\\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\ndown the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----\"\\n\"If he had had any compassion for _me_,\" cried her husband impatiently,\\n\"he would not have danced half so much! For God\\'s sake, say no more of\\nhis partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!\"\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"I am quite delighted with him. He\\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\\nin my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown----\"\\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\nall worth pleasing.

       "   'text': 'When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\\nshe admired him.\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible, good\\nhumoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,\\nwith such perfect good breeding!\"\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man ought\\nlikewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\"\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\\ndid not expect such a compliment.\"\\n\"Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\\nthe room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\\nstupider person.\"\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.\\nYou never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable\\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.\"\\n\"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak\\nwhat I think.\"\\n\"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every\\nwhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good\\nof every body\\'s character and make it still better, and say nothing of\\nthe bad--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man\\'s sisters too,\\ndo you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\n\"Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you\\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep\\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\\nneighbour in her.\"\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\\nwith a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very\\nlittle disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not\\ndeficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of\\nbeing agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were\\nrather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private\\nseminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the\\nhabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\\nof rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\\nthemselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\\nmemories than that their brother\\'s fortune and their own had been\\nacquired by trade.\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred\\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\\nbut did not live to do it.--Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\\nsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\\npurchase.\\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\\nage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to\\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an\\nhour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\\ngreat opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\\neasiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could\\noffer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never\\nappeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\\'s regard Bingley had the\\nfirmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\\nunderstanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,\\nbut Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\nfastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In\\nthat respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of\\nbeing liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\\ngirls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,\\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted\\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too\\nmuch.\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\\nestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such',\n",

       "   'text': 'Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the\\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.\\nThe distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a\\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and\\nquitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a\\nmile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by\\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For\\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\\ncontrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive,\\nfriendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James\\'s had made him\\ncourteous.\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.--They had several children. The\\neldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,\\nwas Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\\n\"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet with civil\\nself-command to Miss Lucas. \"_You_ were Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\n\"Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\n\"Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice. To be\\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he\\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\\nabout Mr. Robinson.\"\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not\\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\\'s asking him how he liked our Meryton\\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\\nanswering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet\\nbeyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.\"\\n\"Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as\\nif----but however, it may all come to nothing you know.\"\\n\"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\" said\\nCharlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\\nis he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\"\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by his\\nill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.\"\\n\"Are you quite sure, Ma\\'am?--is not there a little mistake?\" said\\nJane.--\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\n\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\\ncould not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at\\nbeing spoke to.\"\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much unless\\namong his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\\nagreeable.\"\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\nagreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was;\\nevery body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had\\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to\\nthe ball in a hack chaise.\"\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas, \"but I\\nwish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance with _him_,\\nif I were you.\"\\n\"I believe, Ma\\'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\"\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend _me_ so much as pride\\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,\\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\\nto be proud.\"\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive\\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\"\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\\nreflections, \"is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have\\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human\\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\\nthings, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be\\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas who came with his\\nsisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.\"\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said Mrs.\\nBennet; \"and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle\\ndirectly.\"\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she',\n",

If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\\ndark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_\\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\\ndiscover it too.\"\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as you do.\"\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\\nit, he must find it out.\"\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\\nin love as much as she chuses.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'At five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six\\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then\\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s, she could not make a very\\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored\\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\\nattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\\neat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish\\nto a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\\npronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;\\nshe had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\\nthought the same, and added,\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\\nlooked almost wild.\"\\n\"She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!\"\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\\nin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\\nhide it, not doing its office.\"\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but this was\\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\\nwell, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat\\nquite escaped my notice.\"\\n\"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am\\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\\nan exhibition.\"\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\\nit? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,\\na most country town indifference to decorum.\"\\n\"It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\nBingley.\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\\n\"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\\neyes.\"\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"--A\\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.\\n\"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet\\ngirl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\\nchance of it.\"\\n\"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in\\nMeryton.\"\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it\\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\\nconsideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\\ntheir dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till',\n",

On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\\nthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\\nbelow with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\\nreader and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am\\n_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.\"\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\\nothers; all that his library afforded.\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\\nthan I ever look into.\"\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\\nin the room.\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left\\nso small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at\\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\ngenerations.\"\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\\nbooks.\"\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\\nthese.\"\\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\\nattention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\\nsister, to observe the game.\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will\\nshe be as tall as I am?\"\\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s height, or\\nrather taller.\"\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely\\naccomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is\\nexquisite.\"\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\\nto be so very accomplished, as they all are.\"\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net\\npurses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I\\nnever heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\\ninformed that she was very accomplished.\"\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\notherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very\\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\\ncannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my\\nacquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your\\nidea of an accomplished woman.\"\\n\"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\nesteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all\\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\nwill be but half deserved.\"\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must yet\\nadd something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\\nextensive reading.\"\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\"\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all\\nthis?\"\\n\"_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.\"\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\\nroom.\\n\"Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \"is\\none of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\\nsex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\\nsucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\\n\"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\\ndespicable.\"\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\ncontinue the subject.\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and',\n",

       "   'text': 'Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and in the\\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\\nenquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\\nsisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\\nnote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\\nown judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and\\nits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\\ntwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\\nwould not listen therefore to her daughter\\'s proposal of being carried\\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\\nit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\nBingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\\nattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\\nthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\n\"Indeed I have, Sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill to be\\nmoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\\na little longer on your kindness.\"\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\\nsure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\n\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\\n\"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\\nremains with us.\"\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not\\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\\nvast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\\ntemper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\\n_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\\nover that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\\nequal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I\\nhope, though you have but a short lease.\"\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\\nminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\"\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said Elizabeth.\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning towards her.\\n\"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\"\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\\nthrough I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\n\"That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\\nintricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in\\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a\\nstudier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\\n\"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\\nleast that advantage.\"\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but few subjects for\\nsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined\\nand unvarying society.\"\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\\nobserved in them for ever.\"\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\\ncountry neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\\ngoing on in the country as in town.\"\\nEvery body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\\nturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\\nvictory over him, continued her triumph.\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for\\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\\npleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it; and\\nwhen I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\\nadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\n\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing\\nat all.\"\\n\"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her\\nmother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not\\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\\nyou must acknowledge to be true.\"\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\\nmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families.\"\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\\ncountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\\nMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\\nsaying something that might turn her mother\\'s thoughts, now asked her if\\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\\ngenteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every\\nbody.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy\\nthemselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the\\nmatter.\"\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\n\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For\\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\\nwork; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to\\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I\\nassure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\\nCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman,\" said Bingley.\\n\"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty. I do not like to boast\\nof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body\\nbetter looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own\\npartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my\\nbrother Gardiner\\'s in town, so much in love with her, that my\\nsister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\\nBut however he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\\nwrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has\\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\\ndiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\" said Darcy.\\n\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is\\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\\neach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle\\'s good dinners and her own\\neasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\\nequal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\nabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\\nshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\\nsudden attack was delightful to their mother\\'s ear.\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\\nyour sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of\\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.\"\\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to\\nwait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\\nwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\" she\\nadded, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\\ninstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\' behaviour to the\\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\\nall Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on _fine eyes_.',\n",

       "   'text': 'The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined\\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\nattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\nHe made no answer.\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\n\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the\\nyear! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!\"\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.\"\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\\npens remarkably well.\"\\n\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\"\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\nHe was silent.\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\\nGrantley\\'s.\"\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At\\npresent I have not room to do them justice.\"\\n\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\\nto determine.\"\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with\\nease, cannot write ill.\"\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried her\\nbrother--\"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for\\nwords of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?\"\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way\\nimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which\\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\\nindirect boast.\"\\n\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\"\\n\"The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\\nthought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think\\nat least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with\\nquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\\nBennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?\"\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the\\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\\nprecipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.\"\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\\nwould be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\\ndependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, \\'Bingley, you had better stay\\ntill next week,\\' you would probably do it, you would probably not\\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month.\"\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did\\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much\\nmore than he did himself.\"\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\\nintend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a\\ncircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\\ncould.\"\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\n\"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for\\nhimself.\"\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but\\nwhich I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand\\naccording to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that\\nthe friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the\\ndelay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one\\nargument in favour of its propriety.\"\\n\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\\nwith you.\"\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\\neither.\"\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\\ncircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\\nbetween the parties?\"\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\\nknow a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening\\nwhen he has nothing to do.\"\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\\nrather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\\nbrother for talking such nonsense.\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.--\"You dislike an\\nargument, and want to silence this.\"\\n\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\\nfor the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\\nthe piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead\\nthe way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\\nseated herself.\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed\\nElizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books\\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed\\non her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\\nadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because\\nhe disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine however\\nat last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about\\nher more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than\\nin any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\\nhim too little to care for his approbation.\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\\nlively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\\nElizabeth, said to her--\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\\nopportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\\nsurprise at her silence.\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before; but I could not immediately\\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say \\'Yes,\\'\\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\\ntheir premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell\\nyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\\nyou dare.\"\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\\nmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had\\nnever been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\\nbelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\\nshould be in some danger.\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great\\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some\\nassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\\ntheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\\nnext day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\\nand if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\\nthe officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\\nwhich your lady possesses.\"\\n\"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\n\"Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be\\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle\\nthe judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different\\nlines. As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you must not attempt to have it\\ntaken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\"\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\ncolour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be\\ncopied.\"\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and\\nElizabeth herself.\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley, in some\\nconfusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n\"You used us abominably ill,\" answered Mrs. Hurst, \"in running away\\nwithout telling us that you were coming out.\"\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\\nby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness\\nand immediately said,--\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\\navenue.\"\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\\nlaughingly answered,\\n\"No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group\\'d, and appear to\\nuncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\\nfourth. Good bye.\"\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\\nbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\\nas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.',\n",

       "   'text': 'When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,\\nand seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the\\ndrawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\\nprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\\nas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.\\nTheir powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an\\nentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh\\nat their acquaintance with spirit.\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.\\nMiss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\\nhimself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\\nalso made her a slight bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness\\nand warmth remained for Bingley\\'s salutation. He was full of joy and\\nattention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to\\nthe other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the\\ndoor. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.\\nElizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\\ndelight.\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\ncard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\\nDarcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\\npetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\\nsilence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her. Mr.\\nHurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\\nsophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\\nand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with Miss\\nBennet.\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\\nperpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\\nquestion, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\\nis to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a\\nbook!--When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\\nan excellent library.\"\\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\\ncast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing\\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\\ntowards him and said,\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\\nNetherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\\nsome among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\\npleasure.\"\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he chuses,\\nbefore it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and\\nas soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my\\ncards.\"\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\\ntedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\\nday.\"\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\\nnear so much like a ball.\"\\nMiss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about\\nthe room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at\\nwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation\\nof her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to\\nElizabeth, said,\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\\nturn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting\\nso long in one attitude.\"\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked\\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,\\nthat he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and\\ndown the room together, with either of which motives his joining them\\nwould interfere. \"What could he mean? she was dying to know what could\\nbe his meaning\"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand\\nhim?\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe\\non us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing\\nabout it.\"\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any\\nthing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two\\nmotives.\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon\\nas she allowed him to speak. \"You either chuse this method of passing\\nthe evening because you are in each other\\'s confidence and have secret\\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be\\ncompletely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better\\nas I sit by the fire.\"\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard any thing so\\nabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth. \"We\\ncan all plague and punish one another. Teaze him--laugh at\\nhim.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\\n\"But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\\nyet taught me _that_. Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\\nno--I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\\nourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\\nDarcy may hug himself.\"\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That is an\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\\nbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\\nlaugh.\"\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me credit for more than can be. The\\nwisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,\\nmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\\njoke.\"\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth--\"there are such people, but I hope I am\\nnot one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\\nand nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I\\nlaugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what\\nyou are without.\"\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of\\nmy life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\\nunderstanding to ridicule.\"\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\\nsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\"\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss\\nBingley;--\"and pray what is the result?\"\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\\nhimself without disguise.\"\\n\"No\"--said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\\nfor.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the\\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\\nothers so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\\nfeelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\\nwould perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost\\nfor ever.\"\\n\"_That_ is a failing indeed!\"--cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment\\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well.--I\\nreally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\"\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\\nevil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\\n\"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body.\"\\n\"And yours,\" he replied with a smile, \"is wilfully to misunderstand\\nthem.\"\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\nconversation in which she had no share.--\"Louisa, you will not mind my\\nwaking Mr. Hurst.\"\\nHer sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was\\nopened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for\\nit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.',\n",

As a clergyman, moreover, I\\nfeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\\nall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds\\nI flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly\\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\\nentail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,\\nand not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be\\notherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your\\namiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to\\nassure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but\\nof this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me\\ninto your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on\\nyou and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\\'clock, and\\nshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday\\nse\\'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as\\nLady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a\\nSunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the\\nduty of the day.

As for\\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter had done away much of her ill-will,\\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which\\nastonished her husband and daughters.\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\npoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need\\nof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.

Things are settled so\\noddly.\"\\n\"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.\"\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things\\nI know are all chance in this world.

But I can assure the young ladies that I come\\nprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps\\nwhen we are better acquainted----\"\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\\nother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\\'s admiration. The\\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;\\nand his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s\\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\\nown future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\\nhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its\\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\\nhim with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\\npardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a\\nquarter of an hour.',\n",

Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\\npeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.\\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\nneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\\ntwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly\\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and I\\ndare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\"\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane\\nfrom Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?\"\\n\"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\nextensive property.\"\\n\"Ah!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than\\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?\"\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\\nthat in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the\\nhandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\\nthe young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\\nconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\\naccomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am\\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\\ncourt.\"\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\\nthe British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased\\nwith the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\\nladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\\nher.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\\npay.\"\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you\\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\\nas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,',\n",

Such\\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\\ngo.\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\\nwere immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,\\nand nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin\\nin a shop window, could recal them.\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\\nthey had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking\\nwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\\nMr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,\\nand he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air,\\nall wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of\\nwanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained\\nthe pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same\\nspot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\\nbefore from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in\\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\\ngreatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine\\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,\\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\\npurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth\\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\\nWhat could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was\\nimpossible not to long to know.\\nIn another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\",\n",

Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\\'s uncommon\\nattachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not\\na temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of\\npreference which was often given me.\"\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\nthis!\"\\nAfter a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_ remember\\nhis boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his\\nresentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must\\nbe dreadful.\"\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham, \"_I_ can\\nhardly be just to him.\"\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\\ntreat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his\\nfather!\"--She could have added, \"A young man too, like _you_, whose very\\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented\\nherself with \"And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\\nmanner!\"\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest\\npart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\\nappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use\\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active superintendance,\\nand when immediately before my father\\'s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself.\"\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable!--I wonder that the very\\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better\\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\\ndishonesty I must call it.\"\\n\"It _is_ wonderful,\"--replied Wickham,--\"for almost all his actions may\\nbe traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend. It has\\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger\\nimpulses even than pride.\"\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?\"\\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his\\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve\\nthe poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what\\nhis father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\nwhich with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful\\nguardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the\\nmost attentive and best of brothers.\"',\n",

Elizabeth made no\\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\\nreading in her neighbours\\' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\\nfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\\nbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\\nsome slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent.\\nAfter a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with\\n\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.--_I_ talked about\\nthe dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of\\nthe room, or the number of couples.\"\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\\nsaid.\\n\"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I\\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public\\nones.--But _now_ we may be silent.\"\\n\"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?\"\\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\\nentirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of\\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\nposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\\nsaid he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_\\nthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\\nthe temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.\"\\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his\\nfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\\nconstrained manner said,\\n\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\\n_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\\nis less certain.\"\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\\nwith emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\\nhis life.\"\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\\nDarcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his\\ndancing and his partner.\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very\\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing\\nat her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will\\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,\\nSir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching\\nconverse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\nWilliam\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\\nhe turned to his partner, and said,\\n\"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.\"\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\\nthemselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without\\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\n\"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\nfeelings.\"\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\nno want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions.\"\\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\\nsomething else.\"\\n\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\\nwith a look of doubt.\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\\nby her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\\nthat you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\\ncreated_.\"\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\n\"I hope not.\"\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\\nto be secure of judging properly at first.\"\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\n\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\\nto shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that report may vary\\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\nopportunity.\"\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.',\n",

I do not know the\\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to\\nblame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that\\nthough my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his\\ninvitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had\\ntaken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a\\nmost insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.\\nI pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt;\\nbut really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\\nElizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\\nthan of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward, and of _that_, I can\\nassure you, he informed me himself.\"\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\n\"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant.\"\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.--\"You are much mistaken if\\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.

Jane met her with a smile of\\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the\\nevening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment\\nsolicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing\\nelse gave way before the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for\\nhappiness.\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\nsister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.

       "   'text': 'partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and\\ntold her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to\\nmake a most important discovery.\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now\\nin the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother\\nLady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made\\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\"Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\\nassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\\'night.\"\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her\\nwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she\\nceased speaking, replied thus,\\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider\\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\\nsame time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates\\nof my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look\\non as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your\\nadvice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and\\nhabitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\\nyourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\\nbeing so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\"\\n\"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"--It vexed her to see him\\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained\\nwonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied\\nwith an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy\\'s contempt seemed\\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be\\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"',\n",

Mrs. Hurst and her\\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.

Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,\\n\"May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\\ncourse of this morning?\"\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\nBennet instantly answered,\\n\"Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am\\nsure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\" And\\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\ncalled out,\\n\"Dear Ma\\'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr. Collins must excuse\\nme.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear. I am\\ngoing away myself.\"\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are.\"--And\\nupon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\\nto escape, she added, \"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\\nMr. Collins.\"\\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment\\'s\\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\\nto conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided\\nbetween distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\\nsoon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\\nmother\\'s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\\nfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\\nmarrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of\\nselecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\\nhe continued:\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\\nof matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add\\nvery greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have\\nmentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation\\nof the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.\\nTwice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\nsubject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\nHunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\narranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s foot-stool, that she said, \\'Mr. Collins, you\\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a\\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the\\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any\\nthing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be\\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\\nassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\\nfather, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy\\nmyself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that\\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\\nin the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother\\'s\\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n\"You are too hasty, Sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no\\nanswer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for\\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\\nthem.\"\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\\nhand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\\nthird time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\\nsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\\n\"Upon my word, Sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is rather an\\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_\\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\\nwould make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\\nsituation.\"\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins\\nvery gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.\"\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\\nbelieving what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she thus\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\\naddressed her,\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I\\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\\nfirst application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\\nfemale character.\"\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\\nmay convince you of its being one.\"\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\nrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\\nbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\\nis unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\\nbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\\nwith the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther\\nconsideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\\nportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the\\neffects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\\ntherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\\nshall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\\n\"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind\\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\\nfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\\ntruth from her heart.\"\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\\nbeing acceptable.\"\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\\nreply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he\\npersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\\nin such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.',\n",

If therefore she\\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\\nforce her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is\\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as\\ngood natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\\nhusband, called out as she entered the library,\\n\"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\\nnot have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\\nnot have _her_.\"\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\\non her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\\nher communication.\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had\\nfinished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business.\"\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\\nmarrying him.\"\\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\nlibrary.\\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for\\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?\" Elizabeth replied that it was.\\n\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\\n\"I have, Sir.\"\\n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\\naccepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\\nbe a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you\\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\\nif you _do_.\"\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\\nto _insist_ upon her marrying him.\"\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request.\\nFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\\npresent occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.\"\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\\nMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\\nher interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined\\ninterfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and\\nsometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. Though her manner\\nvaried however, her determination never did.\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\\nHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin\\ncould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\\nway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\\ndeserving her mother\\'s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\\nthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\\nher, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are come, for there is such\\nfun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr. Collins has\\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\\nCharlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,\\nwho came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the\\nbreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\\nthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\\nher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her\\nfamily. \"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone,\\n\"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,\\nnobody feels for my poor nerves.\"\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as unconcerned\\nas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\\nshe can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take\\nit into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\\nto maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep\\nyou--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I\\ntold you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you\\nagain, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in\\ntalking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in\\ntalking to any body. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints\\ncan have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I\\nsuffer!--But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never\\npitied.\"\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\\nattempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.\\nShe talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\\nthey were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately\\nthan usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,\\n\"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\\nlet Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.\"\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\\ndetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\\nnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected\\nconversation.--\"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"--\\n\"My dear Madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this point.\\nFar be it from me,\" he presently continued in a voice that marked his\\ndispleasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to\\ninevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man\\nwho has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I\\ntrust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\\npositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the\\nblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\\nYou will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your\\nfamily, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\\ndaughter\\'s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\\nMy conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission\\nfrom your daughter\\'s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to\\nerror. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object\\nhas been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_',\n",

When they\\nhad gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,\\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a\\ngood deal.

The next was in these words. \"I do not pretend to\\nregret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my\\ndearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many\\nreturns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean\\nwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these high\\nflown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\\nsaw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as\\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\\ncease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\\nintercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater\\nsatisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\\nthem.\"\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\nHertfordshire this winter.

It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.\\nBut you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\" \"Mr. Darcy\\nis impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are\\nscarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana\\nDarcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the\\naffection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into\\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of\\nher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the\\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have\\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her\\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister\\'s\\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\\ncapable of engaging any woman\\'s heart. With all these circumstances to\\nfavour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\\nof so many?\"\\n\"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"--said Jane as she\\nfinished it. \"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare\\nthat Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she\\nis perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s indifference, and that if she\\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\\nput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?\"\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\n\"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\\ndoes not care about you.\"\\nJane shook her head.\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you\\ntogether, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is\\nnot such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy\\nfor herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is\\nthis. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the\\nmore anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\\nwhen there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in\\nachieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\\ndare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of\\nbeing in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\nrepresentation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the\\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any\\none; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\\nherself.\"\\n\"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\\nwill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means.\\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\\nelsewhere?\"\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth, \"and if upon mature\\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\\nall means to refuse him.\"\\n\"How can you talk so?\"--said Jane faintly smiling,--\"You must know that\\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\\nnot hesitate.\"\\n\"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider\\nyour situation with much compassion.\"\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline\\'s\\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\\nso totally independent of every one.\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on\\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\\nJane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\\nBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\\'s conduct;\\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\\nto go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\\nlamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking\\nthat Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,\\nand the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though\\nhe had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have\\ntwo full courses.',\n",

With many compliments to them,\\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\\nhouses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,\\nbut incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than\\npoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always\\nunguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know\\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good breeding carried\\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\\nmost forbearing courtesy.\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\\ntogether; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that\\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\\nconsole and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her\\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\\nor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\\ncould at all forgive their daughter.',\n",
