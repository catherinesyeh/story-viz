Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\\nhim, if you do not.\"\\n\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\ngood humoured as Lydia.

It was then disclosed in the following\\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\\nsuddenly addressed her with,\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.\"\\n\"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother\\nresentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\n\"But you forget, mama,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the\\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\"\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.

She told the story\\nhowever with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\nplayful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her\\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s\\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good\\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\\nbook he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife\\'s\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\\nhad a very different story to hear.\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most\\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well\\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\nher twice. Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her\\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody\\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\ndown the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----\"\\n\"If he had had any compassion for _me_,\" cried her husband impatiently,\\n\"he would not have danced half so much! For God\\'s sake, say no more of\\nhis partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!\"\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"I am quite delighted with him. He\\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\\nin my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown----\"\\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\\ndear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man.\"',\n",

With _your_\\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every\\nwhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good\\nof every body\\'s character and make it still better, and say nothing of\\nthe bad--belongs to you alone.

Mr. Robinson\\'s asking him how he liked our Meryton\\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\\nanswering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet\\nbeyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.\"\\n\"Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as\\nif----but however, it may all come to nothing you know.\"\\n\"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\" said\\nCharlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\\nis he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\"\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by his\\nill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.\"\\n\"Are you quite sure, Ma\\'am?--is not there a little mistake?\" said\\nJane.--\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\n\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\\ncould not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at\\nbeing spoke to.\"\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much unless\\namong his intimate acquaintance.

One cannot wonder that so\\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,\\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\\nto be proud.\"\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive\\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\"\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\\nreflections, \"is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have\\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human\\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\\nthings, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be\\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas who came with his\\nsisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.\"\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said Mrs.\\nBennet; \"and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle\\ndirectly.\"\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\\nwould, and the argument ended only with the visit.',\n",

       "   'text': 'The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\\nwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet\\'s pleasing manners grew on the\\ngood will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\\nfound to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a\\nwish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the\\ntwo eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\\npleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\\nevery body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\nall probability from the influence of their brother\\'s admiration. It was\\ngenerally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to\\n_her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\\nuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\\nsuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss\\nLucas.\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to impose\\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\\ndark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_\\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\\ndiscover it too.\"\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as you do.\"\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\\nit, he must find it out.\"\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\\nin love as much as she chuses.\"\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in\\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\\nthese are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she\\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\\nand has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\\nenough to make her understand his character.\"\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\\nevenings may do a great deal.\"\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\\nchance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a\\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\\never so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the\\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\\nlife.\"\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\"',\n",

You will not be fit to be seen when you get\\nthere.\"\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\"\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the\\nhorses?\"\\n\"No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\"\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but every\\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and\\nLydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set\\noff together.\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps we may\\nsee something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\\nof the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\\nfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\\nover puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within\\nview of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\\nglowing with the warmth of exercise.\\nShe was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\\nsurprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,\\nin such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.\\nHurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her\\nin contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them;\\nand in their brother\\'s manners there was something better than\\npoliteness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very\\nlittle, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between\\nadmiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,\\nand doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming so far alone. The\\nlatter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\nHer enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\\nBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well\\nenough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\\nalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\\nhowever, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,\\ncould attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\\nher.',\n",

But with such\\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\\nchance of it.\"\\n\"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in\\nMeryton.\"\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it\\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\\nconsideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\\ntheir dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\\ndown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\\nthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\\nbelow with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\\nreader and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am\\n_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.\"\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\\nothers; all that his library afforded.\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\\nthan I ever look into.\"\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\\nin the room.\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left\\nso small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at\\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\ngenerations.\"\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\\nbooks.\"\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\\nthese.\"\\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\\nattention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\\nsister, to observe the game.\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will\\nshe be as tall as I am?\"\\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s height, or\\nrather taller.\"\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely\\naccomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is\\nexquisite.\"\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\\nto be so very accomplished, as they all are.\"\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens and net\\npurses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I\\nnever heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\\ninformed that she was very accomplished.\"\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\notherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen. But I am very\\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\\ncannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my\\nacquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your\\nidea of an accomplished woman.\"\\n\"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\nesteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all\\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\nwill be but half deserved.\"\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must yet\\nadd something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\\nextensive reading.\"\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\"\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all\\nthis?\"\\n\"_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.\"\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\\nroom.\\n\"Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \"is\\none of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\\nsex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\\nsucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\\n\"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\\ndespicable.\"\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\ncontinue the subject.',\n",

What an agreeable man Sir\\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\\ngenteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every\\nbody.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy\\nthemselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the\\nmatter.\"\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\n\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For\\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\\nwork; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to\\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I\\nassure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\\nCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman,\" said Bingley.\\n\"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty. I do not like to boast\\nof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body\\nbetter looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own\\npartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my\\nbrother Gardiner\\'s in town, so much in love with her, that my\\nsister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\\nBut however he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\\nwrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has\\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\\ndiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\" said Darcy.\\n\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is\\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\\neach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.',\n",

The power of doing any thing with\\nquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\\nBennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?\"\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the\\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\\nprecipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.\"\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\\nwould be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\\ndependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, \\'Bingley, you had better stay\\ntill next week,\\' you would probably do it, you would probably not\\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month.\"\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did\\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much\\nmore than he did himself.\"\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\\nintend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a\\ncircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\\ncould.\"\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\n\"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for\\nhimself.\"\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but\\nwhich I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand\\naccording to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that\\nthe friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the\\ndelay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one\\nargument in favour of its propriety.\"\\n\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\\nwith you.\"\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\\neither.\"\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\\ncircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\\nbetween the parties?\"',\n",

It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,\\nmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\"\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\\nPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\\nin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\\nchildren; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\\nto do something or other about it.\"\\nJane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\nThey had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.\\nBennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little\\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of\\nhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\\nfriends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father\\ndid before him?\"\\n\"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\\nhead, as you will hear.\"\\n_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\\n15th October._\\nDEAR SIR,\\nThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured\\nfather, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the\\nmisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the\\nbreach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing\\nlest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good\\nterms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at\\nvariance.--\"There, Mrs. Bennet.\"--My mind however is now made up on\\nthe subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been\\nso fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right\\nHonourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,\\nwhose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable\\nrectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to\\ndemean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be\\never ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are\\ninstituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I\\nfeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\\nall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds\\nI flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly\\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\\nentail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,\\nand not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be\\notherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your\\namiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to\\nassure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but\\nof this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me\\ninto your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on\\nyou and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\\'clock, and\\nshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday\\nse\\'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as\\nLady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a\\nSunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the\\nduty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to\\nyour lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\nWILLIAM COLLINS.\"',\n",

He was a tall,\\nheavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and\\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\\ninstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did\\nnot doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.\\nThis gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but\\nMrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,\\n\"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\\nprove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\\noddly.\"\\n\"You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.\"\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things\\nI know are all chance in this world.

But I can assure the young ladies that I come\\nprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps\\nwhen we are better acquainted----\"\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\\nother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\\'s admiration. The\\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;\\nand his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s\\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\\nown future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\\nhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its\\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\\nhim with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\\npardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a\\nquarter of an hour.',\n",

This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming.

She received him with\\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\\napologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\\nher, which he could not help flattering himself however might be\\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\\nher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant\\'s\\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham\\nappeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,\\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\\nofficers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\\ndisagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips\\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\\nwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.',\n",

At first there\\nseemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in\\nparticular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was\\ntherefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to\\nhear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to\\nbe told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\\neven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly\\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\\nan hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\\ndrop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\\nunderstand.\"\\n\"Yes,\" replied Wickham;--\"his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\\nthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\\nconnected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.\"\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\\nyesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth warmly,--\"I have spent\\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\\ndisagreeable.\"\\n\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\\nastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\\nanywhere else.--Here you are in your own family.\"\\n\"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\\nHertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\\nhim more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.\"\\n\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\nill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\\nlikely to be in this country much longer.\"\\n\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\n\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of\\nvery great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every\\nthing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory\\nof his father.\"\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but\\nvery intelligible gallantry.\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\\n\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be a\\nmost respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\\nfarther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\\nwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\\nwere speaking of just now.\"\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\\nelsewhere.\"\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be?--How could\\nhis will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?\"\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.\\nCertain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\nany thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I\\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\\nfreely. I can recal nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.\"\\n\"This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\n\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\\never as he expressed them.\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?--what\\ncan have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\\'s uncommon\\nattachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not\\na temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of\\npreference which was often given me.\"\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\nthis!\"\\nAfter a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_ remember\\nhis boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his\\nresentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must\\nbe dreadful.\"\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham, \"_I_ can\\nhardly be just to him.\"\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\\ntreat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his\\nfather!\"--She could have added, \"A young man too, like _you_, whose very\\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented\\nherself with \"And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\\nmanner!\"',\n",

He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active superintendance,\\nand when immediately before my father\\'s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself.\"\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable!--I wonder that the very\\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better\\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\\ndishonesty I must call it.\"\\n\"It _is_ wonderful,\"--replied Wickham,--\"for almost all his actions may\\nbe traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend. It has\\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger\\nimpulses even than pride.\"\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?\"\\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his\\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve\\nthe poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what\\nhis father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\nwhich with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful\\nguardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the\\nmost attentive and best of brothers.\"',\n",

But she is too much like her brother,--very,\\nvery proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and\\nextremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her\\namusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about\\nfifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished. Since her\\nfather\\'s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her,\\nand superintends her education.\"\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\\nwho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?--Do you\\nknow Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\\nDarcy is.\"\\n\"Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses. He does not\\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\\nnever deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,\\nsincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing\\nsomething for fortune and figure.\"\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\\nthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\\nElizabeth and Mrs. Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were\\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\\nher with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,\\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\\nmake herself uneasy.\\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\\ncard table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\\nare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\\nlittle matters.\"\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him a\\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s\\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\nyesterday.\"\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\\nself-destined to another.\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\\nI suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\\npatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have\\nnot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\\nchuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of\\nthe first class.\"\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\\nan end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\\nWickham\\'s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of\\nMrs. Philips\\'s supper party, but his manners recommended him to every\\nbody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\nfish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and\\nMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\\nthat he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.',\n",

She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\\nthe temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.\"\\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his\\nfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\\nconstrained manner said,\\n\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\\n_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\\nis less certain.\"\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\\nwith emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\\nhis life.\"\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\\nDarcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his\\ndancing and his partner.\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very\\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing\\nat her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will\\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,\\nSir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching\\nconverse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\nWilliam\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\\nhe turned to his partner, and said,\\n\"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.\"\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\\nthemselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without\\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\n\"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\nfeelings.\"\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\nno want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions.\"\\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\\nsomething else.\"\\n\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\\nwith a look of doubt.\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\\nby her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\\nthat you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\\ncreated_.\"\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\n\"I hope not.\"\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\\nto be secure of judging properly at first.\"\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\n\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\\nto shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that report may vary\\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\nopportunity.\"\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.',\n",

Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,\\nnot to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he\\nhas been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has\\ntreated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the\\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to\\nblame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that\\nthough my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his\\ninvitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had\\ntaken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a\\nmost insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.\\nI pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt;\\nbut really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\\nElizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\\nthan of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward, and of _that_, I can\\nassure you, he informed me himself.\"\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\n\"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant.\"\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.--\"You are much mistaken if\\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\\nDarcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the\\nevening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment\\nsolicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing\\nelse gave way before the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for\\nhappiness.\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\nsister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\\nyou may be sure of my pardon.\"\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\\nthe probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his\\nsister\\'s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s\\nregard.\"\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\nperfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\\nhim _conditionally_ only.\"\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly;\\n\"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\\nBingley\\'s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but\\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\\nboth gentlemen as I did before.\"',\n",

Her cousin prefaced his speech with\\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\"\\n\"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"--It vexed her to see him\\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained\\nwonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied\\nwith an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy\\'s contempt seemed\\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be\\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the\\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\\nthat very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\\ncould bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of\\nendeavouring even to like Bingley\\'s two sisters. Her mother\\'s thoughts\\nshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\\nventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\\nopenly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be\\nsoon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.\\nBennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of\\nthe match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living\\nbut three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\\nshe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\\ndaughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\\nchance of it.\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\\'s\\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you\\nto offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\\nso doing.\"\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother\\nwould talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed\\nand blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\nsteady gravity.\\nAt length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\\nElizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\nElizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she\\nwatched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\\namongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be\\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\\nbegan another. Mary\\'s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\\nher voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.\\nShe looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\ntalking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\\nsigns of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however\\nimpenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\\nand when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\\n\"That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\\nLet the other young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\\nElizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father\\'s speech, was afraid\\nher anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to\\nassert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\\nrector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make\\nsuch an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\noffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every\\nbody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot\\nacquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should\\nomit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected\\nwith the family.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,\\nwhich had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many\\nstared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet\\nhimself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having\\nspoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that\\nhe was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by\\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he\\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\\nsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\\nHe assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\\nthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\nher, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\\nthe whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\\nher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\\ngood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins\\'s conversation to herself.\\nShe was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy\\'s farther notice;\\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\\nit.\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\\nmanoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of\\nan hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how\\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a\\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\\nlong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord,\\nhow tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\\naddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\\npleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\\nwaiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\\ngo the next day for a short time.\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\\nsettlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four\\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought',\n",

Secondly, that I am convinced it will add\\nvery greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have\\nmentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation\\nof the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.\\nTwice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\nsubject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\nHunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\narranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s foot-stool, that she said, \\'Mr. Collins, you\\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a\\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the\\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any\\nthing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be\\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\\nassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\\nfather, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy\\nmyself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that\\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\\nin the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother\\'s\\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n\"You are too hasty, Sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no\\nanswer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for\\nthe compliment you are paying me.

Mr. Collins\\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been\\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe\\nit, and could not help saying so.\\n\"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly.

If therefore she\\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\\nforce her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is\\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as\\ngood natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\\nhusband, called out as she entered the library,\\n\"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\\nnot have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\\nnot have _her_.\"',\n",

The envelope contained a\\nsheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s\\nfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change as\\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\\nJane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to\\njoin with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but\\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they\\nhad gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,\\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a\\ngood deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are\\non their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.\\nYou shall hear what she says.\"\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.\\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words. \"I do not pretend to\\nregret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my\\ndearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many\\nreturns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean\\nwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these high\\nflown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\\nsaw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as\\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\\ncease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\\nintercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater\\nsatisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\\nthem.\"\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you--\\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\\ntook him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we\\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\\nCharles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\\nalready there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I\\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of\\nwhom we shall deprive you.\"\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\\nwinter.\"',\n",

I _will_ read you the passage which\\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\" \"Mr. Darcy\\nis impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are\\nscarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana\\nDarcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the\\naffection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into\\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of\\nher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the\\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have\\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her\\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister\\'s\\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\\ncapable of engaging any woman\\'s heart. With all these circumstances to\\nfavour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\\nof so many?\"\\n\"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"--said Jane as she\\nfinished it. \"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare\\nthat Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she\\nis perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s indifference, and that if she\\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\\nput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?\"\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\n\"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\\ndoes not care about you.\"\\nJane shook her head.\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you\\ntogether, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is\\nnot such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy\\nfor herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is\\nthis. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the\\nmore anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\\nwhen there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in\\nachieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\\ndare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of\\nbeing in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\nrepresentation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the\\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any\\none; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\\nherself.\"\\n\"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\\nwill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means.\\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\\nelsewhere?\"\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth, \"and if upon mature\\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\\nall means to refuse him.\"\\n\"How can you talk so?\"--said Jane faintly smiling,--\"You must know that\\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\\nnot hesitate.\"\\n\"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider\\nyour situation with much compassion.\"\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline\\'s\\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\\nso totally independent of every one.\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on\\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\\nJane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\\nBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\\'s conduct;\\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\\nto go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\\nlamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking\\nthat Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,\\nand the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though\\nhe had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have\\ntwo full courses.',\n",

She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of matrimony\\nwas not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it\\npossible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every\\nbetter feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,\\nwas a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing\\nherself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\\nshe had chosen.',\n",
