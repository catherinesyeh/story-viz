Their\\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\\nmany miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry\\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\\nanother corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a\\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\\ncrush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the\\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\\nhole.\\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun\\nand wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes\\nand left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and\\nlips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled\\nnow. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had\\nbeen so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and\\npress her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached\\nher ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she\\ncould find anything to laugh at.\\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his\\nrough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray\\nas her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black\\ndog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on\\neither side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and\\nDorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\",\n",

They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.\\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman\\'s hat was white, and she\\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were\\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,\\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\\nbeards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\\nstiffly.\\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\\ncome farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low\\nbow and said, in a sweet voice:\\n\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the\\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.\"\\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\\nlittle girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.',\n",

Then she sat upon a settee and watched the\\npeople dance.\\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, \"You must be a great sorceress.\"\\n\"Why?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.\\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\\nwear white.\"\\n\"My dress is blue and white checked,\" said Dorothy, smoothing out the\\nwrinkles in it.\\n\"It is kind of you to wear that,\" said Boq. \"Blue is the color of the\\nMunchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly\\nwitch.\"\\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to\\nthink her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange\\nland.\\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made\\nof blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with\\nToto curled up on the blue rug beside her.\\nShe ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played\\nwith Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that\\ngreatly amused Dorothy.

       "   'text': '\"Won\\'t you tell me a story, while we are resting?\" asked the child.\\nThe Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\\n\"My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was\\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that\\ntime is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\\nwas going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\\nI heard was the farmer saying, \\'How do you like those ears?\\'\\n\"\\'They aren\\'t straight,\\'\" answered the other.\\n\"\\'Never mind,\\'\" said the farmer. \"\\'They are ears just the same,\\'\" which\\nwas true enough.\\n\"\\'Now I\\'ll make the eyes,\\'\" said the farmer. So he painted my right\\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\\nfirst glimpse of the world.\\n\"\\'That\\'s a rather pretty eye,\\'\" remarked the Munchkin who was watching\\nthe farmer. \"\\'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.\\'\\n\"\\'I think I\\'ll make the other a little bigger,\\'\" said the farmer. And\\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then\\nhe made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time\\nI didn\\'t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make\\nmy body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at\\nlast, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as\\nanyone.\\n\"\\'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,\\' said the farmer. \\'He\\nlooks just like a man.\\'\\n\"\\'Why, he is a man,\\' said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\\naway and left me alone.\\n\"I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on\\nthat pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,\\nhaving been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds\\nflew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away\\nagain, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel\\nthat I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near\\nme, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and\\nsaid:\\n\"\\'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any\\ncrow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.\\' Then he\\nhopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short\\ntime there was a great flock of them about me.\\n\"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, \\'If you only had\\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.\\'\\n\"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off\\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\\nthe following story:\\n\"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\\nand sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a\\nwoodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\\nlong as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\\n\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry\\nme as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for\\nher; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old\\nwoman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\\nhousework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.\\nThereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\\nleft leg.\\n\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and\\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I\\nwas used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for\\nshe had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin\\ngirl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right\\nleg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of\\ntin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;\\nbut, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked\\nWitch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I\\nthought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come\\nalong, and he made me a new head out of tin.\\n\"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\\ntwo halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\\n\"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There\\nwas only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in\\nmy cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,\\nthere came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a\\nrainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I\\nwas left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a\\nterrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time\\nto think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.\\nWhile I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can\\nlove who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\\none. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.\"',\n",

This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always\\ncareful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept\\nseveral tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his\\nface and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When\\nDorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open\\nhis mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together.

It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and\\nlooked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were\\nmany big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none\\nof them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey\\nmust end.\\n\"What shall we do?\" asked Dorothy despairingly.\\n\"I haven\\'t the faintest idea,\" said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook\\nhis shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.\\nBut the Scarecrow said, \"We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we\\nclimb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it,\\nwe must stop where we are.\"\\n\"I think I could jump over it,\" said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring\\nthe distance carefully in his mind.\\n\"Then we are all right,\" answered the Scarecrow, \"for you can carry us\\nall over on your back, one at a time.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ll try it,\" said the Lion. \"Who will go first?\"\\n\"I will,\" declared the Scarecrow, \"for, if you found that you could not\\njump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly\\ndented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter\\nso much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.\"\\n\"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,\" said the Cowardly Lion, \"but\\nI suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we\\nwill make the attempt.\"\\nThe Scarecrow sat upon the Lion\\'s back, and the big beast walked to the\\nedge of the gulf and crouched down.\\n\"Why don\\'t you run and jump?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"Because that isn\\'t the way we Lions do these things,\" he replied. Then\\ngiving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the\\nother side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,\\nand after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang\\nacross the ditch again.\\nDorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and\\nclimbed on the Lion\\'s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.\\nThe next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and\\nthen, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other\\nside. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then\\nthey all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest,\\nfor his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big\\ndog that has been running too long.',\n",

To\\nadd to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths\\nof the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part\\nof the country that the Kalidahs lived.\\n\"What are the Kalidahs?\" asked the girl.\\n\"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\\ntigers,\" replied the Lion, \"and with claws so long and sharp that they\\ncould tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto.

If the Tin Woodman\\ncan chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk\\nacross it easily.\"\\n\"That is a first-rate idea,\" said the Lion. \"One would almost suspect\\nyou had brains in your head, instead of straw.\"\\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree\\nwas soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front\\nlegs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big\\ntree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top\\nbranches on the other side.\\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl\\nmade them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them\\ntwo great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\\n\"They are the Kalidahs!\" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.\\n\"Quick!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"Let us cross over.\"\\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman\\nfollowed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was\\ncertainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud\\nand terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over\\nbackward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him\\nin surprise.\\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there\\nwere two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed\\nforward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they\\nwould do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began\\nto cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:\\n\"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\\nclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am\\nalive.\"\\n\"Wait a minute!\" called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was\\nbest to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of\\nthe tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began\\nto use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly\\nacross, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,\\nsnarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp\\nrocks at the bottom.\\n\"Well,\" said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, \"I see\\nwe are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it\\nmust be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive.

It was, indeed, a great\\nyellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,\\nfor its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,\\nshowing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of\\nfire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the\\nbeast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he\\nknew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,\\nharmless creature.\\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a\\nquick blow that cut the beast\\'s head clean off from its body, and it\\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\\n\"Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.\"\\n\"Don\\'t speak of it, I beg of you,\" replied the Woodman. \"I have no\\nheart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a\\nfriend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.\"\\n\"Only a mouse!\" cried the little animal, indignantly. \"Why, I am a\\nQueen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!\"\\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said the Woodman, making a bow.\\n\"Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\\nsaving my life,\" added the Queen.\\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\\nexclaimed:\\n\"Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage\\nto escape the great Wildcat?\" They all bowed so low to the little Queen\\nthat they almost stood upon their heads.\\n\"This funny tin man,\" she answered, \"killed the Wildcat and saved my\\nlife.

If you will help us to save him I promise\\nthat he shall treat you all with kindness.\"\\n\"Very well,\" said the Queen, \"we trust you. But what shall we do?\"\\n\"Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to\\nobey you?\"\\n\"Oh, yes; there are thousands,\" she replied.\\n\"Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each\\none bring a long piece of string.\"\\nThe Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at\\nonce and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran\\naway in every direction as fast as possible.\\n\"Now,\" said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, \"you must go to those\\ntrees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.\"\\nSo the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon\\nmade a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all\\nthe leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and\\nmade the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast\\nand so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the\\ntruck was all ready for them.\\nThey came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big\\nmice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a\\npiece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke\\nfrom her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to\\nfind herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing\\naround and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about\\neverything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:\\n\"Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.\"\\nDorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she\\nbecame quite friendly with the little girl.\\nThe Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the\\ntruck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied\\naround the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course\\nthe truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to\\ndraw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to\\npull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit\\non it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place\\nwhere the Lion lay asleep.\\nAfter a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed\\nto get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people\\nthe order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies\\ntoo long they also would fall asleep.\\nAt first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir\\nthe heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed\\nfrom behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out\\nof the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,\\nfresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.\\nDorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving\\nher companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was\\nglad he had been rescued.\\nThen the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away\\nthrough the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to\\nleave.\\n\"If ever you need us again,\" she said, \"come out into the field and\\ncall, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!\"\\n\"Good-bye!\" they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy\\nheld Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.',\n",

       "   'text': 'So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up\\nto the door and knocked.\\nA woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, \"What do you\\nwant, child, and why is that great Lion with you?\"\\n\"We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,\" answered\\nDorothy; \"and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you\\nfor the world.\"\\n\"Is he tame?\" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.\\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the girl, \"and he is a great coward, too. He will be\\nmore afraid of you than you are of him.\"\\n\"Well,\" said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep\\nat the Lion, \"if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you\\nsome supper and a place to sleep.\"\\nSo they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two\\nchildren and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the\\ncouch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a\\ncompany, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\\n\"Where are you all going?\"\\n\"To the Emerald City,\" said Dorothy, \"to see the Great Oz.\"\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" exclaimed the man. \"Are you sure that Oz will see you?\"\\n\"Why not?\" she replied.\\n\"Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I\\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.\"\\n\"Does he never go out?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,\\nand even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.\"\\n\"What is he like?\" asked the girl.\\n\"That is hard to tell,\" said the man thoughtfully. \"You see, Oz is a\\nGreat Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he\\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say\\nhe looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a\\nbrownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,\\nwhen he is in his own form, no living person can tell.\"\\n\"That is very strange,\" said Dorothy, \"but we must try, in some way, to\\nsee him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.\"\\n\"Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?\" asked the man.\\n\"I want him to give me some brains,\" said the Scarecrow eagerly.\\n\"Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,\" declared the man. \"He has more\\nbrains than he needs.\"\\n\"And I want him to give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\\n\"That will not trouble him,\" continued the man, \"for Oz has a large\\ncollection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.\"\\n\"And I want him to give me courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.\\n\"Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,\" said the man,\\n\"which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running\\nover. He will be glad to give you some.\"\\n\"And I want him to send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Where is Kansas?\" asked the man, with surprise.\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" replied Dorothy sorrowfully, \"but it is my home, and\\nI\\'m sure it\\'s somewhere.\"\\n\"Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\\nKansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a\\nhard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he\\nusually has his own way. But what do YOU want?\" he continued, speaking\\nto Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not\\nspeak.',\n",

Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\\ngreen ribbon around Toto\\'s neck, and they started for the Throne Room\\nof the Great Oz.\\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to\\ndo but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\\nOz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\\nwhispered:\\n\"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\"\\n\"Of course,\" answered the girl, \"if he will see me.\"\\n\"Oh, he will see you,\" said the soldier who had taken her message to\\nthe Wizard, \"although he does not like to have people ask to see him.\\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\\ncame from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about\\nthe mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his\\npresence.\"\\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, \"That is the\\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\"\\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\\nwonderful manner.\\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\\nDorothy heard a voice say:\\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\\n\"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\"\\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\\nvoice:\\n\"Where did you get the silver shoes?\"\\n\"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\\nher and killed her,\" she replied.\\n\"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?\" continued the voice.\\n\"That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\" said the girl.\\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\\ntruth. Then Oz asked, \"What do you wish me to do?\"\\n\"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\" she\\nanswered earnestly. \"I don\\'t like your country, although it is so\\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\\nbeing away so long.\"\\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\\n\"Why should I do this for you?\" asked Oz.\\n\"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\\nand I am only a little girl.\"\\n\"But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,\" said\\nOz.\\n\"That just happened,\" returned Dorothy simply; \"I could not help it.\"\\n\"Well,\" said the Head, \"I will give you my answer. You have no right to\\nexpect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in\\nreturn. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If\\nyou wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do\\nsomething for me first. Help me and I will help you.\"\\n\"What must I do?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\" answered Oz.\\n\"But I cannot!\" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\\n\"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\\nbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all\\nthis land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to\\nKansas—but not before.\"\\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\\nfelt that she could help him if she would.\\n\"I never killed anything, willingly,\" she sobbed. \"Even if I wanted to,\\nhow could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,\\ncannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?\"\\n\"I do not know,\" said the Head; \"but that is my answer, and until the\\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember\\nthat the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed.\\nNow go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.\"\\nSorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion\\nand the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had\\nsaid to her. \"There is no hope for me,\" she said sadly, \"for Oz will\\nnot send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and\\nthat I can never do.\"\\nHer friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy\\nwent to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to\\nsleep.',\n",

The Beast had a head like that of a\\nrhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long\\narms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs.\\nThick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more\\ndreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the\\nTin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud\\nand fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all\\nafraid, although he was much disappointed.\\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\" spoke the Beast, in a voice that was\\none great roar. \"Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\\n\"I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot\\nlove. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.\"\\n\"Why should I do this?\" demanded the Beast.\\n\"Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,\" answered the\\nWoodman.\\nOz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: \"If you indeed desire a\\nheart, you must earn it.\"\\n\"How?\" asked the Woodman.\\n\"Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\" replied the Beast.\\n\"When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the\\nbiggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.\"\\nSo the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and\\ntell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly\\nat the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the\\nLion said:\\n\"If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so\\nfrighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely\\nLady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my\\nbidding. And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I\\nwill roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us\\nwhat we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be\\nwell.\"',\n",

At\\nfirst the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened\\nto look into the child\\'s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them\\nwas, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the\\nSilver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and\\nthought, \"I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to\\nuse her power.\" Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:\\n\"Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you\\ndo not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the\\nScarecrow.\"\\nDorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle\\nuntil they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots\\nand kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.\\nDorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as\\nshe could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill\\nher.\\nWith Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the\\ncourtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse\\nher, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to\\ngo to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and\\nbounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and\\nshut the gate again.\\n\"If I cannot harness you,\" said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through\\nthe bars of the gate, \"I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat\\nuntil you do as I wish.\"\\nSo after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day\\nshe came to the gate at noon and asked, \"Are you ready to be harnessed\\nlike a horse?\"\\nAnd the Lion would answer, \"No. If you come in this yard, I will bite\\nyou.\"\\nThe reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that\\nevery night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from\\nthe cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,\\nand Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy\\nmane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to\\nescape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was\\nconstantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the\\nWicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.\\nThe girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch\\nthreatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in\\nher hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of\\nthe mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full\\nof fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with\\nher umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in\\nreturn. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so\\nwicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.',\n",

They had made a chair of their hands and\\nwere careful not to hurt her.\\n\"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?\" she asked.\\n\"That is a long story,\" answered the King, with a winged laugh; \"but as\\nwe have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you\\nabout it, if you wish.\"\\n\"I shall be glad to hear it,\" she replied.\\n\"Once,\" began the leader, \"we were a free people, living happily in the\\ngreat forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and\\ndoing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some\\nof us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull\\nthe tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing\\nnuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and\\nhappy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was\\nmany years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this\\nland.\\n\"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who\\nwas also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the\\npeople, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name\\nwas Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great\\nblocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that\\nshe could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much\\ntoo stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,\\nhowever, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his\\nyears. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she\\nwould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used\\nall her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any\\nwoman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,\\nwas said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly\\nbeauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to\\nmake everything ready for the wedding.\\n\"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\\nlived in the forest near Gayelette\\'s palace, and the old fellow loved a\\njoke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my\\ngrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking\\nbeside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and\\npurple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could\\ndo. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in\\ntheir arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then\\ndropped him into the water.\\n\"\\'Swim out, my fine fellow,\\' cried my grandfather, \\'and see if the\\nwater has spotted your clothes.\\' Quelala was much too wise not to swim,\\nand he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He\\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.\\nBut when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and\\nvelvet all ruined by the river.\\n\"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had\\nall the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that\\ntheir wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had\\ntreated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded\\nhard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings\\ntied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette\\nfinally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever\\nafter do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This\\nCap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to\\nhave cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and\\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how\\nit happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the\\nGolden Cap, whosoever he may be.\"\\n\"And what became of them?\" asked Dorothy, who had been greatly\\ninterested in the story.\\n\"Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,\" replied the Monkey,\\n\"he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not\\nbear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he\\nhad married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never\\nagain set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we\\nwere all afraid of her.\\n\"This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the\\nhands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies,\\nand afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the\\nGolden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your\\nwishes upon us.\"\\nAs the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the\\ngreen, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at\\nthe rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The\\nstrange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of\\nthe City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away,\\nfollowed by all his band.',\n",

Think of me, and the terrible trouble I\\'m in at being found\\nout.\"\\n\"Doesn\\'t anyone else know you\\'re a humbug?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"No one knows it but you four—and myself,\" replied Oz. \"I have fooled\\neveryone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a\\ngreat mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will\\nnot see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.\"\\n\"But, I don\\'t understand,\" said Dorothy, in bewilderment. \"How was it\\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?\"\\n\"That was one of my tricks,\" answered Oz. \"Step this way, please, and I\\nwill tell you all about it.\"\\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and\\nthey all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great\\nHead, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully\\npainted face.\\n\"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,\" said Oz. \"I stood behind the\\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.\"\\n\"But how about the voice?\" she inquired.\\n\"Oh, I am a ventriloquist,\" said the little man. \"I can throw the sound\\nof my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of\\nthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.\" He showed\\nthe Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be\\nthe lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was\\nnothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their\\nsides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also\\nfrom the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was\\npoured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\\n\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for\\nbeing such a humbug.\"\\n\"I am—I certainly am,\" answered the little man sorrowfully; \"but it was\\nthe only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of\\nchairs; and I will tell you my story.\"\\nSo they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.\\n\"I was born in Omaha—\"\\n\"Why, that isn\\'t very far from Kansas!\" cried Dorothy.\\n\"No, but it\\'s farther from here,\" he said, shaking his head at her\\nsadly. \"When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very\\nwell trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or\\nbeast.\" Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears\\nand looked everywhere to see where she was. \"After a time,\" continued\\nOz, \"I tired of that, and became a balloonist.\"\\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,\" he explained.\\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I know.\"\\n\"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\\nthat I couldn\\'t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\\naway. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the\\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a\\nstrange and beautiful country.\\n\"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\\n\"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\"\\n\"But isn\\'t everything here green?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"No more than in any other city,\" replied Oz; \"but when you wear green\\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my\\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\\nthat is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and\\nthey like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself\\nup and would not see any of them.\\n\"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do\\nwonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they\\nruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.\\nFortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew\\nthey would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were\\nterribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they\\nthemselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in\\ndeadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I\\nwas when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.\\nWhen you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would\\nonly do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I\\nam ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.\"\\n\"I think you are a very bad man,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Oh, no, my dear; I\\'m really a very good man, but I\\'m a very bad\\nWizard, I must admit.\"\\n\"Can\\'t you give me brains?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"You don\\'t need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has\\nbrains, but it doesn\\'t know much. Experience is the only thing that\\nbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience\\nyou are sure to get.\"\\n\"That may all be true,\" said the Scarecrow, \"but I shall be very\\nunhappy unless you give me brains.\"\\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\\n\"Well,\" he said with a sigh, \"I\\'m not much of a magician, as I said;\\nbut if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head\\nwith brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find\\nthat out for yourself.\"\\n\"Oh, thank you—thank you!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"I\\'ll find a way to use\\nthem, never fear!\"',\n",

They slept that\\nnight on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they\\nrested very well indeed.\\nIn the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There\\nwas no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and\\nleft as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change\\nthe direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked\\nfor the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with\\nsuch wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass\\nunderneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under\\nthe first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next\\nminute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his\\nfellow travelers.\\nThis did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked\\nrather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.\\n\"Here is another space between the trees,\" called the Lion.\\n\"Let me try it first,\" said the Scarecrow, \"for it doesn\\'t hurt me to\\nget thrown about.\" He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its\\nbranches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.\\n\"This is strange,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"What shall we do?\"\\n\"The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our\\njourney,\" remarked the Lion.\\n\"I believe I will try it myself,\" said the Woodman, and shouldering his\\naxe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so\\nroughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped\\nat it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking\\nall its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under\\nit.\\n\"Come on!\" he shouted to the others. \"Be quick!\" They all ran forward\\nand passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught\\nby a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly\\nchopped off the branch and set the little dog free.\\nThe other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they\\nmade up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down\\ntheir branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the\\nforest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out\\nof it.\\nThe four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came\\nto the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found\\nbefore them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was\\nsmooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.\\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"I will make a ladder,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"for we certainly must\\nclimb over the wall.\"',\n",
