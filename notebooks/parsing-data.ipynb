       "'LINE 1: Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and\\nLINE 2: happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of\\nLINE 3: existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very\\nLINE 4: little to distress or vex her.\\nLINE 5: She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\\nLINE 6: indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister\\'s marriage,\\nLINE 7: been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had\\nLINE 8: died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance\\nLINE 9: of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman\\nLINE 10: as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\\nLINE 11: Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse\\'s family, less as a\\nLINE 12: governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\\nLINE 13: of Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even\\nLINE 14: before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,\\nLINE 15: the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any\\nLINE 16: restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they\\nLINE 17: had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,\\nLINE 18: and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor\\'s\\nLINE 19: judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.\\nLINE 20: The real evils, indeed, of Emma\\'s situation were the power of having\\nLINE 21: rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\\nLINE 22: well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\\nLINE 23: her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so\\nLINE 24: unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with\\nLINE 25: her.\\nLINE 26: Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any\\nLINE 27: disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor\\'s\\nLINE 28: loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\\nLINE 29: beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\\nLINE 30: continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father\\nLINE 31: and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to\\nLINE 32: cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after\\nLINE 33: dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she\\nLINE 34: had lost.\\nLINE 35: The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was\\nLINE 36: a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\\nLINE 37: pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with\\nLINE 38: what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\\nLINE 39: promoted the match; but it was a black morning\\'s work for her. The want\\nLINE 40: of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\\nLINE 41: past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had\\nLINE 42: taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had\\nLINE 43: devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed\\nLINE 44: her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\\nLINE 45: gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,\\nLINE 46: the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\\nLINE 47: Isabella\\'s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\\nLINE 48: dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\\nLINE 49: as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\\nLINE 50: all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\\nLINE 51: peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\\nLINE 52: hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\\nLINE 53: such an affection for her as could never find fault.\\nLINE 54: How was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was going\\nLINE 55: only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\\nLINE 56: difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a\\nLINE 57: Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and\\nLINE 58: domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual\\nLINE 59: solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.\\nLINE 60: He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\\nLINE 61: The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\nLINE 62: not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\nLINE 63: for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind\\nLINE 64: or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\\nLINE 65: everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\\nLINE 66: temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\\nLINE 67: Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\\nLINE 68: settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\\nLINE 69: reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\\nLINE 70: through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\\nLINE 71: Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\\nLINE 72: and give her pleasant society again.\\nLINE 73: Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\nLINE 74: to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\\nLINE 75: name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were\\nLINE 76: first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\\nLINE 77: acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\\nLINE 78: not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for\\nLINE 79: even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but\\nLINE 80: sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,\\nLINE 81: and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He\\nLINE 82: was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was\\nLINE 83: used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.\\nLINE 84: Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was\\nLINE 85: by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter\\'s marrying, nor could\\nLINE 86: ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a\\nLINE 87: match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor\\nLINE 88: too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able\\nLINE 89: to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he\\nLINE 90: was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for\\nLINE 91: herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she\\nLINE 92: had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and\\nLINE 93: chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but\\nLINE 94: when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had\\nLINE 95: said at dinner,\\nLINE 96: \"Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\\nLINE 97: Mr. Weston ever thought of her!\"\\nLINE 98: \"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a\\nLINE 99: good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a\\nLINE 100: good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\\nLINE 101: ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\\nLINE 102: own?\"\\nLINE 103: \"A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\\nLINE 104: This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my\\nLINE 105: dear.\"\\nLINE 106: \"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We\\nLINE 107: shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\\nLINE 108: visit very soon.\"\\nLINE 109: \"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\\nLINE 110: not walk half so far.\"\\nLINE 111: \"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\\nLINE 112: to be sure.\"\\nLINE 113: \"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\\nLINE 114: little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\\nLINE 115: visit?\"\\nLINE 116: \"They are to be put into Mr. Weston\\'s stable, papa. You know we have\\nLINE 117: settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\\nLINE 118: night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\\nLINE 119: to Randalls, because of his daughter\\'s being housemaid there. I only\\nLINE 120: doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\\nLINE 121: papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\\nLINE 122: mentioned her—James is so obliged to you!\"\\nLINE 123: \"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\\nLINE 124: have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\\nLINE 125: sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\\nLINE 126: girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\\nLINE 127: curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\\nLINE 128: have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\\nLINE 129: of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\\nLINE 130: excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\\nLINE 131: to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\\nLINE 132: over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\\nLINE 133: be able to tell her how we all are.\"\\nLINE 134: Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\\nLINE 135: hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through\\nLINE 136: the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\\nLINE 137: backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nLINE 138: walked in and made it unnecessary.\\nLINE 139: Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\nLINE 140: only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\nLINE 141: connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella\\'s husband. He lived\\nLINE 142: about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\\nLINE 143: and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\\nLINE 144: mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\\nLINE 145: some days\\' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\\nLINE 146: well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.\\nLINE 147: Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\\nLINE 148: always did him good; and his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and\\nLINE 149: her children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\\nLINE 150: Woodhouse gratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\\nLINE 151: to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must\\nLINE 152: have had a shocking walk.\"\\nLINE 153: \"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\\nLINE 154: must draw back from your great fire.\"\\nLINE 155: \"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\\nLINE 156: catch cold.\"\\nLINE 157: \"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.\"\\nLINE 158: \"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\\nLINE 159: here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\\nLINE 160: breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"\\nLINE 161: \"By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\\nLINE 162: sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\\nLINE 163: congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\\nLINE 164: all behave? Who cried most?\"\\nLINE 165: \"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! \\'Tis a sad business.\"\\nLINE 166: \"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\\nLINE 167: \\'poor Miss Taylor.\\' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\\nLINE 168: comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it\\nLINE 169: must be better to have only one to please than two.\"\\nLINE 170: \"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\\nLINE 171: creature!\" said Emma playfully. \"That is what you have in your head, I\\nLINE 172: know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"\\nLINE 173: \"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, with\\nLINE 174: a sigh. \"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"\\nLINE 175: \"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\\nLINE 176: Knightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\\nLINE 177: myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a\\nLINE 178: joke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.\"\\nLINE 179: Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\\nLINE 180: in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\\nLINE 181: though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it\\nLINE 182: would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\\nLINE 183: really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\\nLINE 184: every body.\\nLINE 185: \"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I meant no\\nLINE 186: reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\\nLINE 187: to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be\\nLINE 188: a gainer.\"\\nLINE 189: \"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass—\"you want to hear about the\\nLINE 190: wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\\nLINE 191: charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:\\nLINE 192: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that\\nLINE 193: we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting\\nLINE 194: every day.\"\\nLINE 195: \"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father. \"But, Mr.\\nLINE 196: Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\\nLINE 197: sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\"\\nLINE 198: Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. \"It is\\nLINE 199: impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\" said Mr.\\nLINE 200: Knightley. \"We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\\nLINE 201: suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor\\'s\\nLINE 202: advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor\\'s\\nLINE 203: time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\\nLINE 204: her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\\nLINE 205: herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\\nLINE 206: must be glad to have her so happily married.\"\\nLINE 207: \"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma, \"and a\\nLINE 208: very considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made the match,\\nLINE 209: you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in\\nLINE 210: the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,\\nLINE 211: may comfort me for any thing.\"\\nLINE 212: Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, \"Ah! my\\nLINE 213: dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\\nLINE 214: whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\\nLINE 215: matches.\"\\nLINE 216: \"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\\nLINE 217: other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\\nLINE 218: success, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\\nLINE 219: again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\\nLINE 220: seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\\nLINE 221: either in his business in town or among his friends here, always\\nLINE 222: acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend\\nLINE 223: a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\\nLINE 224: Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\\nLINE 225: promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\\nLINE 226: uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\\nLINE 227: subject, but I believed none of it.\\nLINE 228: \"Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met\\nLINE 229: with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\\nLINE 230: away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\\nLINE 231: Farmer Mitchell\\'s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the\\nLINE 232: match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this\\nLINE 233: instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off\\nLINE 234: match-making.\"\\nLINE 235: \"I do not understand what you mean by \\'success,\\'\" said Mr. Knightley.\\nLINE 236: \"Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\\nLINE 237: spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\\nLINE 238: about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady\\'s mind! But\\nLINE 239: if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,\\nLINE 240: means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, \\'I\\nLINE 241: think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were\\nLINE 242: to marry her,\\' and saying it again to yourself every now and then\\nLINE 243: afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are\\nLINE 244: you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be\\nLINE 245: said.\"\\nLINE 246: \"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I\\nLINE 247: pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\\nLINE 248: never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor\\nLINE 249: word \\'success,\\' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\\nLINE 250: entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\\nLINE 251: but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and\\nLINE 252: the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston\\'s visits here, and given\\nLINE 253: many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\\nLINE 254: not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\\nLINE 255: enough to comprehend that.\"\\nLINE 256: \"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\\nLINE 257: unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\\nLINE 258: own concerns.

       "   'text': 'MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down\\ninto a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies\\' eardrops and\\ntraversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the\\nold Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook\\nin its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool\\nand cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde\\'s Hollow it was a quiet,\\nwell-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs.\\nRachel Lynde\\'s door without due regard for decency and decorum; it\\nprobably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window,\\nkeeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children\\nup, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never\\nrest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.\\nThere are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend\\nclosely to their neighbor\\'s business by dint of neglecting their own;\\nbut Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage\\ntheir own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a\\nnotable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she \"ran\" the\\nSewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop\\nof the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all\\nthis Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen\\nwindow, knitting \"cotton warp\" quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them,\\nas Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping\\na sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up\\nthe steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular\\npeninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two\\nsides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that\\nhill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel\\'s all-seeing\\neye.\\nShe was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in\\nat the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house\\nwas in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of\\nbees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called \"Rachel\\nLynde\\'s husband\"--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field\\nbeyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on\\nthe big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew\\nthat he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening\\nbefore in William J. Blair\\'s store over at Carmody that he meant to sow\\nhis turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for\\nMatthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about\\nanything in his whole life.\\nAnd yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon\\nof a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill;\\nmoreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was\\nplain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy\\nand the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable\\ndistance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going\\nthere?\\nHad it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this\\nand that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both\\nquestions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be\\nsomething pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest\\nman alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where\\nhe might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and\\ndriving in a buggy, was something that didn\\'t happen often. Mrs. Rachel,\\nponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoon\\'s\\nenjoyment was spoiled.\\n\"I\\'ll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla\\nwhere he\\'s gone and why,\" the worthy woman finally concluded. \"He\\ndoesn\\'t generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if\\nhe\\'d run out of turnip seed he wouldn\\'t dress up and take the buggy to\\ngo for more; he wasn\\'t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor.\\nYet something must have happened since last night to start him off. I\\'m\\nclean puzzled, that\\'s what, and I won\\'t know a minute\\'s peace of mind or\\nconscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea\\ntoday.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the\\nbig, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a\\nscant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde\\'s Hollow. To be sure, the\\nlong lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert\\'s father, as\\nshy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly\\ncould from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods\\nwhen he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest\\nedge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible\\nfrom the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so\\nsociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place\\n_living_ at all.\\n\"It\\'s just _staying_, that\\'s what,\" she said as she stepped along the\\ndeep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. \"It\\'s no wonder\\nMatthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by\\nthemselves. Trees aren\\'t much company, though dear knows if they were\\nthere\\'d be enough of them. I\\'d ruther look at people. To be sure, they\\nseem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they\\'re used to it. A body\\ncan get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.\"\\nWith this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green\\nGables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one\\nside with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies.\\nNot a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have\\nseen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla\\nCuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could\\nhave eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial\\npeck of dirt.\\nMrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in\\nwhen bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful\\napartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully\\nclean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its\\nwindows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on\\nthe back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one,\\nwhence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left\\norchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook,\\nwas greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when\\nshe sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to\\nher too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to\\nbe taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind\\nher was laid for supper.\\nMrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental\\nnote of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid,\\nso that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but\\nthe dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves\\nand one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any\\nparticular company. Yet what of Matthew\\'s white collar and the sorrel\\nmare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery\\nabout quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.',\n",

We\\'re getting a little boy from an\\norphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he\\'s coming on the train tonight.\"\\nIf Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a\\nkangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.\\nShe was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable\\nthat Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to\\nsuppose it.\\n\"Are you in earnest, Marilla?\" she demanded when voice returned to her.\\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums\\nin Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated\\nAvonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.\\nMrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought\\nin exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people\\nadopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly\\nturning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this!\\nNothing!\\n\"What on earth put such a notion into your head?\" she demanded\\ndisapprovingly.\\nThis had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be\\ndisapproved.\\n\"Well, we\\'ve been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,\"\\nreturned Marilla. \"Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before\\nChristmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the\\nasylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs.\\nSpencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have\\ntalked it over off and on ever since. We thought we\\'d get a boy. Matthew\\nis getting up in years, you know--he\\'s sixty--and he isn\\'t so spry as he\\nonce was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate\\nhard it\\'s got to be to get hired help. There\\'s never anybody to be had\\nbut those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do\\nget one broke into your ways and taught something he\\'s up and off to the\\nlobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a\\nHome boy. But I said \\'no\\' flat to that. \\'They may be all right--I\\'m not\\nsaying they\\'re not--but no London street Arabs for me,\\' I said. \\'Give\\nme a native born at least. There\\'ll be a risk, no matter who we get. But\\nI\\'ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born\\nCanadian.\\' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out\\none when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she\\nwas going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer\\'s folks at Carmody\\nto bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that\\nwould be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores\\nright off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him\\na good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer\\ntoday--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming\\non the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to\\nmeet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to\\nWhite Sands station herself.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'She had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her\\neyes on him now. Matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen\\nwhat she was really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would\\nhave seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very\\ntight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey. She wore a faded brown\\nsailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids\\nof very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin,\\nalso much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which\\nlooked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.\\nSo far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen\\nthat the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes\\nwere full of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped\\nand expressive; that the forehead was broad and full; in short,\\nour discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no\\ncommonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom\\nshy Matthew Cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid.\\nMatthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon\\nas she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with\\none thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag;\\nthe other she held out to him.\\n\"I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?\" she said in\\na peculiarly clear, sweet voice. \"I\\'m very glad to see you. I was\\nbeginning to be afraid you weren\\'t coming for me and I was imagining\\nall the things that might have happened to prevent you. I had made up\\nmy mind that if you didn\\'t come for me to-night I\\'d go down the track to\\nthat big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all\\nnight. I wouldn\\'t be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a\\nwild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don\\'t you think?\\nYou could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn\\'t you? And\\nI was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn\\'t\\nto-night.\"\\nMatthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his; then and\\nthere he decided what to do. He could not tell this child with the\\nglowing eyes that there had been a mistake; he would take her home and\\nlet Marilla do that. She couldn\\'t be left at Bright River anyhow, no\\nmatter what mistake had been made, so all questions and explanations\\nmight as well be deferred until he was safely back at Green Gables.\\n\"I\\'m sorry I was late,\" he said shyly. \"Come along. The horse is over in\\nthe yard. Give me your bag.\"\\n\"Oh, I can carry it,\" the child responded cheerfully. \"It isn\\'t heavy.',\n",

       "   'text': 'I\\'ve got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn\\'t heavy. And if it isn\\'t\\ncarried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so I\\'d better\\nkeep it because I know the exact knack of it. It\\'s an extremely old\\ncarpet-bag. Oh, I\\'m very glad you\\'ve come, even if it would have been\\nnice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. We\\'ve got to drive a long piece,\\nhaven\\'t we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. I\\'m glad because I\\nlove driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I\\'m going to live with you\\nand belong to you. I\\'ve never belonged to anybody--not really. But the\\nasylum was the worst. I\\'ve only been in it four months, but that was\\nenough. I don\\'t suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you\\ncan\\'t possibly understand what it is like. It\\'s worse than anything you\\ncould imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like\\nthat, but I didn\\'t mean to be wicked. It\\'s so easy to be wicked without\\nknowing it, isn\\'t it? They were good, you know--the asylum people. But\\nthere is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just\\nin the other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about\\nthem--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really\\nthe daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents\\nin her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. I\\nused to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because\\nI didn\\'t have time in the day. I guess that\\'s why I\\'m so thin--I _am_\\ndreadful thin, ain\\'t I? There isn\\'t a pick on my bones. I do love to\\nimagine I\\'m nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows.\"\\nWith this Matthew\\'s companion stopped talking, partly because she was\\nout of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy. Not another\\nword did she say until they had left the village and were driving down\\na steep little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into\\nthe soft soil, that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees\\nand slim white birches, were several feet above their heads.\\nThe child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that\\nbrushed against the side of the buggy.\\n\"Isn\\'t that beautiful? What did that tree, leaning out from the bank,\\nall white and lacy, make you think of?\" she asked.\\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\\n\"Why, a bride, of course--a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil.\\nI\\'ve never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like. I don\\'t\\never expect to be a bride myself. I\\'m so homely nobody will ever want to\\nmarry me--unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign\\nmissionary mightn\\'t be very particular. But I do hope that some day I\\nshall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I\\njust love pretty clothes. And I\\'ve never had a pretty dress in my life\\nthat I can remember--but of course it\\'s all the more to look forward\\nto, isn\\'t it? And then I can imagine that I\\'m dressed gorgeously. This\\nmorning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear\\nthis horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you\\nknow. A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of\\nwincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn\\'t sell\\nit, but I\\'d rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart,\\nwouldn\\'t you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be\\nlooking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that\\nI had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you _are_\\nimagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big\\nhat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and\\nboots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island\\nwith all my might. I wasn\\'t a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither\\nwas Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn\\'t time\\nto get sick, watching to see that I didn\\'t fall overboard. She said she\\nnever saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from\\nbeing seasick it\\'s a mercy I did prowl, isn\\'t it? And I wanted to see\\neverything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn\\'t know\\nwhether I\\'d ever have another opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more\\ncherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just\\nlove it already, and I\\'m so glad I\\'m going to live here. I\\'ve always\\nheard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world,\\nand I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I\\nwould. It\\'s delightful when your imaginations come true, isn\\'t it?\\nBut those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at\\nCharlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer\\nwhat made them red and she said she didn\\'t know and for pity\\'s sake not\\nto ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand\\nalready. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about\\nthings if you don\\'t ask questions? And what _does_ make the roads red?\"\\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\\n\"Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn\\'t it splendid\\nto think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes\\nme feel glad to be alive--it\\'s such an interesting world. It wouldn\\'t be\\nhalf so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There\\'d\\nbe no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I talking too\\nmuch? People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I didn\\'t\\ntalk? If you say so I\\'ll stop. I can _stop_ when I make up my mind to it,',\n",

       "   'text': 'although it\\'s difficult.\"\\nMatthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet\\nfolks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking\\nthemselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had\\nnever expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad\\nenough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the\\nway they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if\\nthey expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to\\nsay a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But\\nthis freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather\\ndifficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental\\nprocesses he thought that he \"kind of liked her chatter.\" So he said as\\nshyly as usual:\\n\"Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don\\'t mind.\"\\n\"Oh, I\\'m so glad. I know you and I are going to get along together\\nfine. It\\'s such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told\\nthat children should be seen and not heard. I\\'ve had that said to me a\\nmillion times if I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big\\nwords. But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express\\nthem, haven\\'t you?\"\\n\"Well now, that seems reasonable,\" said Matthew.\\n\"Mrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. But it\\nisn\\'t--it\\'s firmly fastened at one end. Mrs. Spencer said your place was\\nnamed Green Gables. I asked her all about it. And she said there were\\ntrees all around it. I was gladder than ever. I just love trees. And\\nthere weren\\'t any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny\\nthings out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them.\\nThey just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did. It used to\\nmake me want to cry to look at them. I used to say to them, \\'Oh, you\\n_poor_ little things! If you were out in a great big woods with other\\ntrees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your\\nroots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you\\ncould grow, couldn\\'t you? But you can\\'t where you are. I know just\\nexactly how you feel, little trees.\\' I felt sorry to leave them behind\\nthis morning. You do get so attached to things like that, don\\'t you? Is\\nthere a brook anywhere near Green Gables? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer\\nthat.\"\\n\"Well now, yes, there\\'s one right below the house.\"\\n\"Fancy. It\\'s always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I\\nnever expected I would, though. Dreams don\\'t often come true, do they?\\nWouldn\\'t it be nice if they did? But just now I feel pretty nearly\\nperfectly happy. I can\\'t feel exactly perfectly happy because--well,\\nwhat color would you call this?\"\\nShe twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and\\nheld it up before Matthew\\'s eyes. Matthew was not used to deciding on\\nthe tints of ladies\\' tresses, but in this case there couldn\\'t be much\\ndoubt.\\n\"It\\'s red, ain\\'t it?\" he said.\\nThe girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from\\nher very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.\\n\"Yes, it\\'s red,\" she said resignedly. \"Now you see why I can\\'t be\\nperfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don\\'t mind the other\\nthings so much--the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness. I\\ncan imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf\\ncomplexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I _cannot_ imagine that\\nred hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, \\'Now my hair is a\\nglorious black, black as the raven\\'s wing.\\' But all the time I _know_ it\\nis just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong sorrow.\\nI read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn\\'t\\nred hair. Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow.\\nWhat is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell me?\"\\n\"Well now, I\\'m afraid I can\\'t,\" said Matthew, who was getting a little\\ndizzy. He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy\\nhad enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic.\\n\"Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was\\ndivinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be\\ndivinely beautiful?\"\\n\"Well now, no, I haven\\'t,\" confessed Matthew ingenuously.\\n\"I have, often. Which would you rather be if you had the\\nchoice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?\"\\n\"Well now, I--I don\\'t know exactly.\"\\n\"Neither do I. I can never decide. But it doesn\\'t make much real\\ndifference for it isn\\'t likely I\\'ll ever be either. It\\'s certain I\\'ll\\nnever be angelically good. Mrs. Spencer says--oh, Mr. Cuthbert! Oh, Mr.\\nCuthbert!! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!!!\"\\nThat was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled\\nout of the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing. They had\\nsimply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the \"Avenue.\"\\nThe \"Avenue,\" so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of road\\nfour or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge,\\nwide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old\\nfarmer. Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom. Below the\\nboughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse\\nof painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a\\ncathedral aisle.\\nIts beauty seemed to strike the child dumb. She leaned back in the\\nbuggy, her thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to\\nthe white splendor above. Even when they had passed out and were driving\\ndown the long slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke. Still with\\nrapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw\\nvisions trooping splendidly across that glowing background. Through\\nNewbridge, a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small\\nboys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows, they drove, still\\nin silence. When three more miles had dropped away behind them the child\\nhad not spoken. She could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically\\nas she could talk.\\n\"I guess you\\'re feeling pretty tired and hungry,\" Matthew ventured to\\nsay at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the\\nonly reason he could think of. \"But we haven\\'t very far to go now--only\\nanother mile.\"\\nShe came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the\\ndreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led.\\n\"Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,\" she whispered, \"that place we came through--that\\nwhite place--what was it?\"\\n\"Well now, you must mean the Avenue,\" said Matthew after a few moments\\'\\nprofound reflection. \"It is a kind of pretty place.\"\\n\"Pretty? Oh, _pretty_ doesn\\'t seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful,\\neither. They don\\'t go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful--wonderful.\\nIt\\'s the first thing I ever saw that couldn\\'t be improved upon by\\nimagination. It just satisfies me here\"--she put one hand on her\\nbreast--\"it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache. Did\\nyou ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?\"\\n\"Well now, I just can\\'t recollect that I ever had.\"\\n\"I have it lots of time--whenever I see anything royally beautiful. But\\nthey shouldn\\'t call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning\\nin a name like that. They should call it--let me see--the White Way of\\nDelight. Isn\\'t that a nice imaginative name? When I don\\'t like the name\\nof a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of\\nthem so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins,\\nbut I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that',\n",

A bridge spanned it\\nmidway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of\\nsand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a\\nglory of many shifting hues--the most spiritual shadings of crocus and\\nrose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name\\nhas ever been found. Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing\\ngroves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering\\nshadows. Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a\\nwhite-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection. From the marsh at the\\nhead of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.\\nThere was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on\\na slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was\\nshining from one of its windows.\\n\"That\\'s Barry\\'s pond,\" said Matthew.\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t like that name, either.

I hate the look of\\nthem.\"\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you\\nthink it can? There doesn\\'t seem to be much connection between grubs\\nand lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it\\nBarry\\'s pond?\"\\n\"I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house. Orchard\\nSlope\\'s the name of his place. If it wasn\\'t for that big bush behind it\\nyou could see Green Gables from here. But we have to go over the bridge\\nand round by the road, so it\\'s near half a mile further.\"\\n\"Has Mr. Barry any little girls? Well, not so very little either--about\\nmy size.\"\\n\"He\\'s got one about eleven. Her name is Diana.\"\\n\"Oh!\" with a long indrawing of breath. \"What a perfectly lovely name!\"\\n\"Well now, I dunno. There\\'s something dreadful heathenish about it,\\nseems to me. I\\'d ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that.\\nBut when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they\\ngave him the naming of her and he called her Diana.\"\\n\"I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born,\\nthen. Oh, here we are at the bridge. I\\'m going to shut my eyes tight.\\nI\\'m always afraid going over bridges. I can\\'t help imagining that\\nperhaps just as we get to the middle, they\\'ll crumple up like a\\njack-knife and nip us. So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them\\nfor all when I think we\\'re getting near the middle. Because, you see, if\\nthe bridge _did_ crumple up I\\'d want to _see_ it crumple. What a jolly\\nrumble it makes! I always like the rumble part of it. Isn\\'t it splendid\\nthere are so many things to like in this world? There we\\'re over. Now\\nI\\'ll look back. Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters. I always say\\ngood night to the things I love, just as I would to people. I think they\\nlike it. That water looks as if it was smiling at me.\"\\nWhen they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew\\nsaid:\\n\"We\\'re pretty near home now. That\\'s Green Gables over--\"\\n\"Oh, don\\'t tell me,\" she interrupted breathlessly, catching at his\\npartially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his\\ngesture. \"Let me guess. I\\'m sure I\\'ll guess right.\"\\nShe opened her eyes and looked about her. They were on the crest of a\\nhill. The sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still\\nclear in the mellow afterlight. To the west a dark church spire rose\\nup against a marigold sky. Below was a little valley and beyond a long,\\ngently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it. From one\\nto another the child\\'s eyes darted, eager and wistful. At last they\\nlingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white\\nwith blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods. Over it,\\nin the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining\\nlike a lamp of guidance and promise.\\n\"That\\'s it, isn\\'t it?\" she said, pointing.\\nMatthew slapped the reins on the sorrel\\'s back delightedly.\\n\"Well now, you\\'ve guessed it! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it\\nso\\'s you could tell.\"\\n\"No, she didn\\'t--really she didn\\'t. All she said might just as well have\\nbeen about most of those other places. I hadn\\'t any real idea what it\\nlooked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home. Oh, it\\nseems as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and\\nblue from the elbow up, for I\\'ve pinched myself so many times today.\\nEvery little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and\\nI\\'d be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I\\'d pinch myself to see if it\\nwas real--until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only\\na dream I\\'d better go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped\\npinching. But it _is_ real and we\\'re nearly home.\"\\nWith a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred\\nuneasily. He felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he who would\\nhave to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was\\nnot to be hers after all. They drove over Lynde\\'s Hollow, where it was\\nalready quite dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them\\nfrom her window vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green\\nGables. By the time they arrived at the house Matthew was shrinking from\\nthe approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand. It was\\nnot of Marilla or himself he was thinking or of the trouble this mistake\\nwas probably going to make for them, but of the child\\'s disappointment.\\nWhen he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had\\nan uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering\\nsomething--much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill\\na lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature.\\nThe yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves\\nwere rustling silkily all round it.\\n\"Listen to the trees talking in their sleep,\" she whispered, as he\\nlifted her to the ground. \"What nice dreams they must have!\"\\nThen, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained \"all her worldly\\ngoods,\" she followed him into the house.',\n",

Oh, wasn't it beautiful? Wasn't it a lovely\\nplace? Suppose she wasn't really going to stay here! She would imagine\\nshe was. There was scope for imagination here.\\nA huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against\\nthe house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf\\nwas to be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of\\napple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms;\\nand their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below\\nwere lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance\\ndrifted up to the window on the morning wind.\\nBelow the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the\\nhollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew,\\nupspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful\\npossibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally. Beyond it\\nwas a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in\\nit where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the\\nother side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible.\\nOff to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over\\ngreen, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.\\nAnne's beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily\\nin. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child;\\nbut this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.\\nShe knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until\\nshe was startled by a hand on her shoulder.

I\\'ve never seen that\\nhouse, but I\\'ve imagined it thousands of times. I think it must have\\nhad honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and\\nlilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in\\nall the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born\\nin that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I\\nwas so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I\\nwas perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge\\nthan a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn\\'t you? I\\'m glad she\\nwas satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a\\ndisappointment to her--because she didn\\'t live very long after that, you\\nsee. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she\\'d\\nlived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it\\nwould be so sweet to say \\'mother,\\' don\\'t you? And father died four days\\nafterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at\\ntheir wits\\' end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see,\\nnobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother\\nhad both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn\\'t any\\nrelatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she\\'d take me, though she was\\npoor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up by hand. Do you know\\nif there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make\\npeople who are brought up that way better than other people? Because\\nwhenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a\\nbad girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.\\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I\\nlived with them until I was eight years old. I helped look after the\\nThomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and I can tell\\nyou they took a lot of looking after. Then Mr. Thomas was killed\\nfalling under a train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the\\nchildren, but she didn\\'t want me. Mrs. Thomas was at _her_ wits\\' end, so\\nshe said, what to do with me. Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came\\ndown and said she\\'d take me, seeing I was handy with children, and\\nI went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the\\nstumps. It was a very lonesome place. I\\'m sure I could never have\\nlived there if I hadn\\'t had an imagination. Mr. Hammond worked a little\\nsawmill up there, and Mrs. Hammond had eight children. She had twins\\nthree times. I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in\\nsuccession is _too much_. I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly, when the last\\npair came. I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about.\\n\"I lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond\\ndied and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She divided her children\\namong her relatives and went to the States. I had to go to the asylum\\nat Hopeton, because nobody would take me. They didn\\'t want me at the\\nasylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had\\nto take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came.\"',\n",

Take the armchair, Miss\\nCuthbert. Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don\\'t wiggle. Let\\nme take your hats. Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on. Good\\nafternoon, Mrs. Blewett.

I forgot to tell Flora\\nJane to take the buns out of the oven.\"\\nMrs. Spencer whisked away, after pulling up the blinds. Anne sitting\\nmutely on the ottoman, with her hands clasped tightly in her lap, stared\\nat Mrs Blewett as one fascinated. Was she to be given into the keeping\\nof this sharp-faced, sharp-eyed woman? She felt a lump coming up in her\\nthroat and her eyes smarted painfully. She was beginning to be afraid\\nshe couldn\\'t keep the tears back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed\\nand beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical,\\nmental or spiritual, into consideration and settling it out of hand.\\n\"It seems there\\'s been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs. Blewett,\"\\nshe said. \"I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted\\na little girl to adopt. I was certainly told so. But it seems it was a\\nboy they wanted. So if you\\'re still of the same mind you were yesterday,\\nI think she\\'ll be just the thing for you.\"\\nMrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.\\n\"How old are you and what\\'s your name?\" she demanded.\\n\"Anne Shirley,\" faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make any\\nstipulations regarding the spelling thereof, \"and I\\'m eleven years old.\"\\n\"Humph!

Yes, I\\nsuppose I might as well take her off your hands, Miss Cuthbert. The\\nbaby\\'s awful fractious, and I\\'m clean worn out attending to him. If you\\nlike I can take her right home now.\"\\nMarilla looked at Anne and softened at sight of the child\\'s pale face\\nwith its look of mute misery--the misery of a helpless little creature\\nwho finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.\\nMarilla felt an uncomfortable conviction that, if she denied the appeal\\nof that look, it would haunt her to her dying day. More-over, she did\\nnot fancy Mrs. Blewett. To hand a sensitive, \"highstrung\" child over to\\nsuch a woman! No, she could not take the responsibility of doing that!\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know,\" she said slowly. \"I didn\\'t say that Matthew and I\\nhad absolutely decided that we wouldn\\'t keep her. In fact I may say that\\nMatthew is disposed to keep her. I just came over to find out how the\\nmistake had occurred. I think I\\'d better take her home again and talk it\\nover with Matthew. I feel that I oughtn\\'t to decide on anything without\\nconsulting him. If we make up our mind not to keep her we\\'ll bring or\\nsend her over to you tomorrow night. If we don\\'t you may know that she\\nis going to stay with us. Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?\"\\n\"I suppose it\\'ll have to,\" said Mrs. Blewett ungraciously.\\nDuring Marilla\\'s speech a sunrise had been dawning on Anne\\'s face.

I\\'ve dreamed of meeting her all\\nmy life. I never really supposed I would, but so many of my loveliest\\ndreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. Do\\nyou think it\\'s possible?\"\\n\"Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she\\'s about your age. She\\'s\\na very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when\\nshe comes home. She\\'s visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now. You\\'ll\\nhave to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is a\\nvery particular woman. She won\\'t let Diana play with any little girl who\\nisn\\'t nice and good.\"\\nAnne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with\\ninterest.\\n\"What is Diana like? Her hair isn\\'t red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It\\'s bad\\nenough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn\\'t endure it in a\\nbosom friend.\"\\n\"Diana is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and\\nrosy cheeks. And she is good and smart, which is better than being\\npretty.\"\\nMarilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was\\nfirmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a\\nchild who was being brought up.\\nBut Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the\\ndelightful possibilities before it.\\n\"Oh, I\\'m so glad she\\'s pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself--and\\nthat\\'s impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom\\nfriend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting\\nroom with glass doors. There weren\\'t any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept\\nher best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to\\nkeep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night\\nwhen he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to\\npretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in\\nit. I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to\\ntalk to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything.\\nKatie was the comfort and consolation of my life. We used to pretend\\nthat the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I\\ncould open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice\\nlived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas\\' shelves of preserves and china. And\\nthen Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a\\nwonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have\\nlived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond\\nit just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully,\\ntoo, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye\\nthrough the bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond\\'s. But\\njust up the river a little way from the house there was a long green\\nlittle valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every\\nword you said, even if you didn\\'t talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it\\nwas a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved\\nher almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you\\nknow. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta,\\nand oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had\\nbecome so attached to her that I hadn\\'t the heart to imagine a bosom\\nfriend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination\\nthere.\"\\n\"I think it\\'s just as well there wasn\\'t,\" said Marilla drily. \"I\\ndon\\'t approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe your own\\nimaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to\\nput such nonsense out of your head. But don\\'t let Mrs. Barry hear you\\ntalking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she\\'ll think you\\ntell stories.\"\\n\"Oh, I won\\'t. I couldn\\'t talk of them to everybody--their memories are',\n",

And\\nyou _were_ too hard on her, Rachel.\"\\nMarilla could not help tacking on that last sentence, although she was\\nagain surprised at herself for doing it. Mrs. Rachel got up with an air\\nof offended dignity.\\n\"Well, I see that I\\'ll have to be very careful what I say after this,\\nMarilla, since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness\\nknows where, have to be considered before anything else. Oh, no, I\\'m not\\nvexed--don\\'t worry yourself. I\\'m too sorry for you to leave any room for\\nanger in my mind. You\\'ll have your own troubles with that child. But\\nif you\\'ll take my advice--which I suppose you won\\'t do, although I\\'ve\\nbrought up ten children and buried two--you\\'ll do that \\'talking to\\' you\\nmention with a fair-sized birch switch.

Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an\\nuncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation\\nover this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect\\nin Anne\\'s disposition. And how was she to punish her? The amiable\\nsuggestion of the birch switch--to the efficiency of which all of Mrs.\\nRachel\\'s own children could have borne smarting testimony--did not\\nappeal to Marilla.

As\\na general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little\\nbedroom off the hall where he slept; once in a while he ventured\\nuncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to\\ntea. But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he\\nhelped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.\\nHe tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the\\ndoor of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his\\nfingers and then open the door to peep in.\\nAnne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out\\ninto the garden. Very small and unhappy she looked, and Matthew\\'s heart\\nsmote him. He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her.\\n\"Anne,\" he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, \"how are you\\nmaking it, Anne?\"\\nAnne smiled wanly.\\n\"Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of\\ncourse, it\\'s rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that.\"\\nAnne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary\\nimprisonment before her.\\nMatthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without\\nloss of time, lest Marilla return prematurely. \"Well now, Anne, don\\'t\\nyou think you\\'d better do it and have it over with?\" he whispered.\\n\"It\\'ll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla\\'s a\\ndreadful deter-mined woman--dreadful determined, Anne. Do it right off,\\nI say, and have it over.\"\\n\"Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?\"\\n\"Yes--apologize--that\\'s the very word,\" said Matthew eagerly. \"Just\\nsmooth it over so to speak. That\\'s what I was trying to get at.\"\\n\"I suppose I could do it to oblige you,\" said Anne thoughtfully. \"It\\nwould be true enough to say I am sorry, because I _am_ sorry now. I wasn\\'t\\na bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all\\nnight. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just\\nfurious every time. But this morning it was over. I wasn\\'t in a temper\\nanymore--and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed\\nof myself. But I just couldn\\'t think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde\\nso. It would be so humiliating. I made up my mind I\\'d stay shut up here\\nforever rather than do that. But still--I\\'d do anything for you--if you\\nreally want me to--\"\\n\"Well now, of course I do. It\\'s terrible lonesome downstairs without\\nyou. Just go and smooth things over--that\\'s a good girl.\"\\n\"Very well,\" said Anne resignedly. \"I\\'ll tell Marilla as soon as she\\ncomes in I\\'ve repented.\"\\n\"That\\'s right--that\\'s right, Anne. But don\\'t tell Marilla I said\\nanything about it. She might think I was putting my oar in and I\\npromised not to do that.\"\\n\"Wild horses won\\'t drag the secret from me,\" promised Anne solemnly.\\n\"How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?\"\\nBut Matthew was gone, scared at his own success. He fled hastily to the\\nremotest corner of the horse pasture lest Marilla should suspect what',\n",

She\\nlifted her head and stepped lightly along, her eyes fixed on the sunset\\nsky and an air of subdued exhilaration about her. Marilla beheld the\\nchange disapprovingly. This was no meek penitent such as it behooved her\\nto take into the presence of the offended Mrs. Lynde.\\n\"What are you thinking of, Anne?\" she asked sharply.\\n\"I\\'m imagining out what I must say to Mrs. Lynde,\" answered Anne\\ndreamily.\\nThis was satisfactory--or should have been so. But Marilla could not\\nrid herself of the notion that something in her scheme of punishment was\\ngoing askew. Anne had no business to look so rapt and radiant.\\nRapt and radiant Anne continued until they were in the very presence\\nof Mrs. Lynde, who was sitting knitting by her kitchen window. Then the\\nradiance vanished. Mournful penitence appeared on every feature. Before\\na word was spoken Anne suddenly went down on her knees before the\\nastonished Mrs. Rachel and held out her hands beseechingly.\\n\"Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry,\" she said with a quiver in\\nher voice. \"I could never express all my sorrow, no, not if I used up\\na whole dictionary.

Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla,\\nhad plumed herself? Anne had turned it into a species of positive\\npleasure.\\nGood Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see\\nthis. She only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and\\nall resentment vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart.\\n\"There, there, get up, child,\" she said heartily. \"Of course I forgive\\nyou. I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway. But I\\'m such an\\noutspoken person. You just mustn\\'t mind me, that\\'s what. It can\\'t be\\ndenied your hair is terrible red; but I knew a girl once--went to school\\nwith her, in fact--whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she\\nwas young, but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn. I\\nwouldn\\'t be a mite surprised if yours did, too--not a mite.\"\\n\"Oh, Mrs. Lynde!\" Anne drew a long breath as she rose to her feet. \"You\\nhave given me a hope. I shall always feel that you are a benefactor. Oh,\\nI could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome\\nauburn when I grew up. It would be so much easier to be good if one\\'s\\nhair was a handsome auburn, don\\'t you think? And now may I go out into\\nyour garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and\\nMarilla are talking? There is so much more scope for imagination out\\nthere.\"\\n\"Laws, yes, run along, child. And you can pick a bouquet of them white\\nJune lilies over in the corner if you like.\"\\nAs the door closed behind Anne Mrs. Lynde got briskly up to light a\\nlamp.\\n\"She\\'s a real odd little thing. Take this chair, Marilla; it\\'s easier\\nthan the one you\\'ve got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit\\non. Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of\\ntaking about her after all. I don\\'t feel so surprised at you and Matthew\\nkeeping her as I did--nor so sorry for you, either. She may turn out all\\nright. Of course, she has a queer way of expressing herself--a little\\ntoo--well, too kind of forcible, you know; but she\\'ll likely get over\\nthat now that she\\'s come to live among civilized folks. And then, her\\ntemper\\'s pretty quick, I guess; but there\\'s one comfort, a child that\\nhas a quick temper, just blaze up and cool down, ain\\'t never likely to\\nbe sly or deceitful.

She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold\\nAnne for apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous! She\\ncompromised with her conscience by saying severely:\\n\"I hope you won\\'t have occasion to make many more such apologies. I hope\\nyou\\'ll try to control your temper now, Anne.\"\\n\"That wouldn\\'t be so hard if people wouldn\\'t twit me about my looks,\"\\nsaid Anne with a sigh. \"I don\\'t get cross about other things; but I\\'m\\n_so_ tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right\\nover. Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I\\ngrow up?\"\\n\"You shouldn\\'t think so much about your looks, Anne. I\\'m afraid you are\\na very vain little girl.\"\\n\"How can I be vain when I know I\\'m homely?\" protested Anne. \"I love\\npretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that\\nisn\\'t pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful--just as I feel when I look\\nat any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn\\'t beautiful.\"\\n\"Handsome is as handsome does,\" quoted Marilla. \"I\\'ve had that said\\nto me before, but I have my doubts about it,\" remarked skeptical Anne,\\nsniffing at her narcissi. \"Oh, aren\\'t these flowers sweet! It was lovely\\nof Mrs. Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings against Mrs.\\nLynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and\\nbe forgiven, doesn\\'t it? Aren\\'t the stars bright tonight? If you could\\nlive in a star, which one would you pick? I\\'d like that lovely clear big\\none away over there above that dark hill.\"\\n\"Anne, do hold your tongue,\" said Marilla, thoroughly worn out trying to\\nfollow the gyrations of Anne\\'s thoughts.\\nAnne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy\\nwind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young\\ndew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out\\nthrough the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came\\nclose to Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman\\'s hard palm.\\n\"It\\'s lovely to be going home and know it\\'s home,\" she said. \"I love\\nGreen Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever\\nseemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I\\'m so happy. I could pray right now and\\nnot find it a bit hard.\"\\nSomething warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla\\'s heart at touch of\\nthat thin little hand in her own--a throb of the maternity she had\\nmissed, perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed\\nher. She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by\\ninculcating a moral.\\n\"If you\\'ll be a good girl you\\'ll always be happy, Anne. And you should\\nnever find it hard to say your prayers.\"\\n\"Saying one\\'s prayers isn\\'t exactly the same thing as praying,\" said\\nAnne meditatively. \"But I\\'m going to imagine that I\\'m the wind that is\\nblowing up there in those tree tops. When I get tired of the trees I\\'ll\\nimagine I\\'m gently waving down here in the ferns--and then I\\'ll fly over\\nto Mrs. Lynde\\'s garden and set the flowers dancing--and then I\\'ll go\\nwith one great swoop over the clover field--and then I\\'ll blow over the\\nLake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves.\\nOh, there\\'s so much scope for imagination in a wind! So I\\'ll not talk\\nany more just now, Marilla.\"\\n\"Thanks be to goodness for that,\" breathed Marilla in devout relief.',\n",

       "   'text': 'WELL, how do you like them?\" said Marilla.\\nAnne was standing in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new\\ndresses spread out on the bed. One was of snuffy colored gingham which\\nMarilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer\\nbecause it looked so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered\\nsateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and\\none was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that\\nweek at a Carmody store.\\nShe had made them up herself, and they were all made alike--plain skirts\\nfulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt\\nand tight as sleeves could be.\\n\"I\\'ll imagine that I like them,\" said Anne soberly.\\n\"I don\\'t want you to imagine it,\" said Marilla, offended. \"Oh, I can see\\nyou don\\'t like the dresses! What is the matter with them? Aren\\'t they\\nneat and clean and new?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Then why don\\'t you like them?\"\\n\"They\\'re--they\\'re not--pretty,\" said Anne reluctantly.\\n\"Pretty!\" Marilla sniffed. \"I didn\\'t trouble my head about getting\\npretty dresses for you. I don\\'t believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I\\'ll\\ntell you that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable\\ndresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they\\'re all\\nyou\\'ll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do\\nyou for school when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and Sunday\\nschool. I\\'ll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear\\nthem. I should think you\\'d be grateful to get most anything after those\\nskimpy wincey things you\\'ve been wearing.\"\\n\"Oh, I _am_ grateful,\" protested Anne. \"But I\\'d be ever so much\\ngratefuller if--if you\\'d made just one of them with puffed sleeves.\\nPuffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill,\\nMarilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.\"\\n\"Well, you\\'ll have to do without your thrill. I hadn\\'t any material\\nto waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things\\nanyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones.\"\\n\"But I\\'d rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and\\nsensible all by myself,\" persisted Anne mournfully.\\n\"Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your\\ncloset, and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson. I got\\na quarterly from Mr. Bell for you and you\\'ll go to Sunday school\\ntomorrow,\" said Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school\\nclass for twenty years. Her method of teaching was to ask the printed\\nquestions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the\\nparticular little girl she thought ought to answer the question. She\\nlooked very often at Anne, and Anne, thanks to Marilla\\'s drilling,\\nanswered promptly; but it may be questioned if she understood very much\\nabout either question or answer.\\nShe did not think she liked Miss Rogerson, and she felt very miserable;\\nevery other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that\\nlife was really not worth living without puffed sleeves.\\n\"Well, how did you like Sunday school?\" Marilla wanted to know when Anne\\ncame home. Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane,\\nso Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.\\n\"I didn\\'t like it a bit. It was horrid.\"\\n\"Anne Shirley!\" said Marilla rebukingly.\\nAnne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny\\'s\\nleaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.\\n\"They might have been lonesome while I was away,\" she explained. \"And\\nnow about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs.\\nLynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with\\na lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the\\nwindow while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully\\nlong prayer. I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through\\nif I hadn\\'t been sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the\\nLake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts\\nof splendid things.\"\\n\"You shouldn\\'t have done anything of the sort. You should have listened\\nto Mr. Bell.\"\\n\"But he wasn\\'t talking to me,\" protested Anne. \"He was talking to God\\nand he didn\\'t seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. I think\\nhe thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of white\\nbirches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through\\nthem, \\'way, \\'way down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a\\nbeautiful dream! It gave me a thrill and I just said, \\'Thank you for it,\\nGod,\\' two or three times.\"\\n\"Not out loud, I hope,\" said Marilla anxiously.\\n\"Oh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last\\nand they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson\\'s class.\\nThere were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried\\nto imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn\\'t. Why couldn\\'t I? It was\\nas easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in\\nthe east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had\\nreally truly puffs.\"\\n\"You shouldn\\'t have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school.\\nYou should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it.\"\\n\"Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so\\nmany. I don\\'t think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were\\nlots I wanted to ask her, but I didn\\'t like to because I didn\\'t think\\nshe was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a\\nparaphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn\\'t, but I could\\nrecite, \\'The Dog at His Master\\'s Grave\\' if she liked. That\\'s in the\\nThird Royal Reader. It isn\\'t a really truly religious piece of poetry,\\nbut it\\'s so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it\\nwouldn\\'t do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next\\nSunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it\\'s splendid. There are\\ntwo lines in particular that just thrill me.\\n\"\\'Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell\\nIn Midian\\'s evil day.\\'\\n\"I don\\'t know what \\'squadrons\\' means nor \\'Midian,\\' either, but it sounds\\n_so_ tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it.\\nI\\'ll practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss\\nRogerson--because Mrs. Lynde was too far away--to show me your pew.\\nI sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third\\nchapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text. If I was a\\nminister I\\'d pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long,\\ntoo. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didn\\'t think\\nhe was a bit interesting. The trouble with him seems to be that he\\nhasn\\'t enough imagination. I didn\\'t listen to him very much. I just let\\nmy thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things.\"\\nMarilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but\\nshe was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things Anne had\\nsaid, especially about the minister\\'s sermons and Mr. Bell\\'s prayers,\\nwere what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for\\nyears, but had never given expression to. It almost seemed to her that\\nthose secret, unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible\\nand accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of\\nneglected humanity.',\n",

Neither the shelves nor the porch needed it--but Marilla did. Then\\nshe went out and raked the yard.\\nWhen dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called Anne. A\\ntear-stained face appeared, looking tragically over the banisters.\\n\"Come down to your dinner, Anne.\"\\n\"I don\\'t want any dinner, Marilla,\" said Anne, sobbingly. \"I couldn\\'t\\neat anything. My heart is broken. You\\'ll feel remorse of conscience\\nsomeday, I expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I forgive you. Remember\\nwhen the time comes that I forgive you. But please don\\'t ask me to eat\\nanything, especially boiled pork and greens. Boiled pork and greens are\\nso unromantic when one is in affliction.\"\\nExasperated, Marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale\\nof woe to Matthew, who, between his sense of justice and his unlawful\\nsympathy with Anne, was a miserable man.\\n\"Well now, she shouldn\\'t have taken the brooch, Marilla, or told stories\\nabout it,\" he admitted, mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic\\npork and greens as if he, like Anne, thought it a food unsuited to\\ncrises of feeling, \"but she\\'s such a little thing--such an interesting\\nlittle thing. Don\\'t you think it\\'s pretty rough not to let her go to the\\npicnic when she\\'s so set on it?\"\\n\"Matthew Cuthbert, I\\'m amazed at you. I think I\\'ve let her off entirely\\ntoo easy. And she doesn\\'t appear to realize how wicked she\\'s been at\\nall--that\\'s what worries me most. If she\\'d really felt sorry it wouldn\\'t\\nbe so bad. And you don\\'t seem to realize it, neither; you\\'re making\\nexcuses for her all the time to yourself--I can see that.\"\\n\"Well now, she\\'s such a little thing,\" feebly reiterated Matthew. \"And\\nthere should be allowances made, Marilla. You know she\\'s never had any\\nbringing up.\"\\n\"Well, she\\'s having it now\" retorted Marilla.\\nThe retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him. That dinner was\\na very dismal meal. The only cheerful thing about it was Jerry Buote,\\nthe hired boy, and Marilla resented his cheerfulness as a personal\\ninsult.',\n",

She\\'s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair\\nand she does it up so elegantly. She sits in the long seat at the back\\nand he sits there, too, most of the time--to explain her lessons, he\\nsays. But Ruby Gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate\\nand when Prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and\\nRuby Gillis says she doesn\\'t believe it had anything to do with the\\nlesson.\"\\n\"Anne Shirley, don\\'t let me hear you talking about your teacher in that\\nway again,\" said Marilla sharply. \"You don\\'t go to school to criticize\\nthe master.

That is something I won\\'t encourage.\\nI hope you were a good girl.\"\\n\"Indeed I was,\" said Anne comfortably. \"It wasn\\'t so hard as you might\\nimagine, either. I sit with Diana.

With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes\\nfixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west\\nwindow afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and\\nseeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.\\nGilbert Blythe wasn\\'t used to putting himself out to make a girl look\\nat him and meeting with failure. She _should_ look at him, that red-haired\\nShirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren\\'t\\nlike the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.\\nGilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne\\'s long red\\nbraid, held it out at arm\\'s length and said in a piercing whisper:\\n\"Carrots! Carrots!\"\\nThen Anne looked at him with a vengeance!\\nShe did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies\\nfallen into cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert\\nfrom eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry\\ntears.\\n\"You mean, hateful boy!\" she exclaimed passionately. \"How dare you!\"\\nAnd then--thwack! Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert\\'s head and\\ncracked it--slate not head--clear across.\\nAvonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable\\none. Everybody said \"Oh\" in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby\\nGillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry.

Anne returned no\\nanswer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell\\nbefore the whole school that she had been called \"carrots.\" Gilbert it\\nwas who spoke up stoutly.\\n\"It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her.\"\\nMr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.\\n\"I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such\\na vindictive spirit,\" he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of\\nbeing a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts\\nof small imperfect mortals. \"Anne, go and stand on the platform in front\\nof the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.\"\\nAnne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under\\nwhich her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white,\\nset face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the\\nblackboard above her head.\\n\"Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control\\nher temper,\" and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,\\nwho couldn\\'t read writing, should understand it.\\nAnne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.\\nShe did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart\\nfor that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With\\nresentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana\\'s\\nsympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane\\'s indignant nods and Josie Pye\\'s\\nmalicious smiles.

I never saw a child so worked up. I\\'ve been\\nexpecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were\\ngoing too smooth to last. She\\'s so high strung. What would you advise,\\nRachel?\"\\n\"Well, since you\\'ve asked my advice, Marilla,\" said Mrs. Lynde\\namiably--Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--\"I\\'d just\\nhumor her a little at first, that\\'s what I\\'d do. It\\'s my belief that\\nMr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn\\'t do to say so to the\\nchildren, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday\\nfor giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who\\nwere late should have been punished as well as Anne, that\\'s what. And I\\ndon\\'t believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It\\nisn\\'t modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne\\'s part\\nright through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular\\namong them, somehow. I never thought she\\'d take with them so well.\"\\n\"Then you really think I\\'d better let her stay home,\" said Marilla in\\namazement.\\n\"Yes. That is I wouldn\\'t say school to her again until she said it\\nherself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she\\'ll cool off in a week or so and\\nbe ready enough to go back of her own accord, that\\'s what, while, if\\nyou were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum\\nshe\\'d take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the\\nbetter, in my opinion. She won\\'t miss much by not going to school, as\\nfar as _that_ goes. Mr. Phillips isn\\'t any good at all as a teacher. The\\norder he keeps is scandalous, that\\'s what, and he neglects the young\\nfry and puts all his time on those big scholars he\\'s getting ready for\\nQueen\\'s. He\\'d never have got the school for another year if his uncle\\nhadn\\'t been a trustee--_the_ trustee, for he just leads the other two\\naround by the nose, that\\'s what. I declare, I don\\'t know what education\\nin this Island is coming to.\"\\nMrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the\\nhead of the educational system of the Province things would be much\\nbetter managed.\\nMarilla took Mrs. Rachel\\'s advice and not another word was said to Anne',\n",

In a trice Anne was out of the house\\nand flying down to the hollow, astonishment and hope struggling in\\nher expressive eyes. But the hope faded when she saw Diana\\'s dejected\\ncountenance.\\n\"Your mother hasn\\'t relented?\" she gasped.\\nDiana shook her head mournfully.\\n\"No; and oh, Anne, she says I\\'m never to play with you again. I\\'ve cried\\nand cried and I told her it wasn\\'t your fault, but it wasn\\'t any use. I\\nhad ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to\\nyou. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she\\'s timing me by the\\nclock.\"\\n\"Ten minutes isn\\'t very long to say an eternal farewell in,\" said Anne\\ntearfully. \"Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget\\nme, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress\\nthee?\"\\n\"Indeed I will,\" sobbed Diana, \"and I\\'ll never have another bosom\\nfriend--I don\\'t want to have. I couldn\\'t love anybody as I love you.\"\\n\"Oh, Diana,\" cried Anne, clasping her hands, \"do you _love_ me?\"\\n\"Why, of course I do. Didn\\'t you know that?\"\\n\"No.\" Anne drew a long breath. \"I thought you _liked_ me of course but I\\nnever hoped you _loved_ me. Why, Diana, I didn\\'t think anybody could\\nlove me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is\\nwonderful! It\\'s a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness\\nof a path severed from thee, Diana. Oh, just say it once again.\"\\n\"I love you devotedly, Anne,\" said Diana stanchly, \"and I always will,\\nyou may be sure of that.\"\\n\"And I will always love thee, Diana,\" said Anne, solemnly extending her\\nhand. \"In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my\\nlonely life, as that last story we read together says. Diana, wilt\\nthou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure\\nforevermore?\"\\n\"Have you got anything to cut it with?\" queried Diana, wiping away the\\ntears which Anne\\'s affecting accents had caused to flow afresh, and\\nreturning to practicalities.\\n\"Yes. I\\'ve got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately,\"\\nsaid Anne. She solemnly clipped one of Diana\\'s curls. \"Fare thee well,\\nmy beloved friend. Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side\\nby side. But my heart will ever be faithful to thee.\"\\nAnne stood and watched Diana out of sight, mournfully waving her hand\\nto the latter whenever she turned to look back. Then she returned to\\nthe house, not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic\\nparting.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely\\nat the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green\\nGables all to themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned\\nWaterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the\\nwindowpanes. Matthew nodded over a _Farmers\\' Advocate_ on the sofa and\\nAnne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite\\nsundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that\\nJane Andrews had lent her that day. Jane had assured her that it was\\nwarranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and\\nAnne\\'s fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that would mean Gilbert\\nBlythe\\'s triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her back on the clock shelf\\nand tried to imagine it wasn\\'t there.\\n\"Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?\"\\n\"Well now, no, I didn\\'t,\" said Matthew, coming out of his doze with a\\nstart.\\n\"I wish you had,\" sighed Anne, \"because then you\\'d be able to sympathize\\nwith me. You can\\'t sympathize properly if you\\'ve never studied it. It is\\ncasting a cloud over my whole life. I\\'m such a dunce at it, Matthew.\"\\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew soothingly. \"I guess you\\'re all right\\nat anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair\\'s store at Carmody\\nthat you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid\\nprogress. \\'Rapid progress\\' was his very words. There\\'s them as runs down\\nTeddy Phillips and says he ain\\'t much of a teacher, but I guess he\\'s all\\nright.\"\\nMatthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was \"all right.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure I\\'d get on better with geometry if only he wouldn\\'t change\\nthe letters,\" complained Anne. \"I learn the proposition off by heart and\\nthen he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what\\nare in the book and I get all mixed up. I don\\'t think a teacher should\\ntake such a mean advantage, do you? We\\'re studying agriculture now and\\nI\\'ve found out at last what makes the roads red. It\\'s a great comfort.\\nI wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde\\nsays Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa\\nand that it\\'s an awful warning to the electors. She says if women were\\nallowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change. What way do you\\nvote, Matthew?\"\\n\"Conservative,\" said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was part of\\nMatthew\\'s religion.\\n\"Then I\\'m Conservative too,\" said Anne decidedly. \"I\\'m glad because\\nGil--because some of the boys in school are Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips\\nis a Grit too because Prissy Andrews\\'s father is one, and Ruby Gillis\\nsays that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl\\'s',\n",

I\\'ll do all the chores.\"\\nAnne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it\\nwas well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and\\ndescended to the kitchen where Marilla, who had arrived home in the\\nmeantime, was sitting knitting.\\n\"Oh, did you see the Premier?\" exclaimed Anne at once. \"What did he look\\nlike Marilla?\"\\n\"Well, he never got to be Premier on account of his looks,\" said\\nMarilla. \"Such a nose as that man had! But he can speak. I was proud of\\nbeing a Conservative. Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no\\nuse for him. Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself\\nsome blue plum preserve out of the pantry. I guess you\\'re hungry.\\nMatthew has been telling me about last night. I must say it was\\nfortunate you knew what to do. I wouldn\\'t have had any idea myself, for\\nI never saw a case of croup. There now, never mind talking till you\\'ve\\nhad your dinner. I can tell by the look of you that you\\'re just full up\\nwith speeches, but they\\'ll keep.\"\\nMarilla had something to tell Anne, but she did not tell it just then\\nfor she knew if she did Anne\\'s consequent excitement would lift her\\nclear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner.\\nNot until Anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did Marilla say:\\n\"Mrs. Barry was here this afternoon, Anne. She wanted to see you, but I\\nwouldn\\'t wake you up. She says you saved Minnie May\\'s life, and she is\\nvery sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. She\\nsays she knows now you didn\\'t mean to set Diana drunk, and she hopes\\nyou\\'ll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again. You\\'re to go\\nover this evening if you like for Diana can\\'t stir outside the door\\non account of a bad cold she caught last night.

The tinkles\\nof sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through\\nthe frosty air, but their music was not sweeter than the song in Anne\\'s\\nheart and on her lips.\\n\"You see before you a perfectly happy person, Marilla,\" she announced.\\n\"I\\'m perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair. Just at present I\\nhave a soul above red hair. Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried and said she\\nwas so sorry and she could never repay me.

I assure you once for all that I did not\\nmean to intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the\\nmantle of oblivion.\\' That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn\\'t\\nit, Marilla?\"\\n\"I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry\\'s head.

Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but\\nus, and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else. Diana\\ngave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of\\npoetry:\"\\n\"If you love me as I love you\\nNothing but death can part us two.\"\\n\"And that is true, Marilla. We\\'re going to ask Mr. Phillips to let us\\nsit together in school again, and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews.\\nWe had an elegant tea. Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out,\\nMarilla, just as if I was real company. I can\\'t tell you what a thrill\\nit gave me. Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before.\\nAnd we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of\\npreserves, Marilla. And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said \\'Pa,\\nwhy don\\'t you pass the biscuits to Anne?\\' It must be lovely to be grown\\nup, Marilla, when just being treated as if you were is so nice.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know about that,\" said Marilla, with a brief sigh.\\n\"Well, anyway, when I am grown up,\" said Anne decidedly, \"I\\'m always\\ngoing to talk to little girls as if they were too, and I\\'ll never laugh\\nwhen they use big words. I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts\\none\\'s feelings. After tea Diana and I made taffy. The taffy wasn\\'t very\\ngood, I suppose because neither Diana nor I had ever made any before.\\nDiana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and\\nlet it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat\\nwalked over one plate and that had to be thrown away. But the making of\\nit was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come\\nover as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses\\nto me all the way down to Lover\\'s Lane. I assure you, Marilla, that I\\nfeel like praying tonight and I\\'m going to think out a special brand-new\\nprayer in honor of the occasion.\"',\n",

She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see\\nDiana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up\\nwith a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.\\n\"Who are you?\" demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.\\n\"I\\'m Anne of Green Gables,\" said the small visitor tremulously, clasping\\nher hands with her characteristic gesture, \"and I\\'ve come to confess, if\\nyou please.\"\\n\"Confess what?\"\\n\"That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I\\nsuggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure.\\nDiana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it\\nis to blame her.\"\\n\"Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at\\nleast. Such carryings on in a respectable house!\"\\n\"But we were only in fun,\" persisted Anne. \"I think you ought to forgive\\nus, Miss Barry, now that we\\'ve apologized. And anyhow, please forgive\\nDiana and let her have her music lessons. Diana\\'s heart is set on her\\nmusic lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your\\nheart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be\\ncross with me. I\\'ve been so used in my early days to having people cross\\nat me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.\"\\nMuch of the snap had gone out of the old lady\\'s eyes by this time\\nand was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she still said\\nseverely:\\n\"I don\\'t think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.\\nLittle girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young. You\\ndon\\'t know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long\\nand arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.\"\\n\"I don\\'t _know_, but I can _imagine_,\" said Anne eagerly. \"I\\'m sure it must\\nhave been very disturbing. But then, there is our side of it too. Have\\nyou any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have, just put yourself in\\nour place. We didn\\'t know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly\\nscared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we\\ncouldn\\'t sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are\\nused to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel\\nlike if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.\"\\nAll the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed--a\\nsound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen\\noutside, to give a great gasp of relief.\\n\"I\\'m afraid my imagination is a little rusty--it\\'s so long since I used\\nit,\" she said. \"I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as\\nmine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell me\\nabout yourself.\"\\n\"I am very sorry I can\\'t,\" said Anne firmly. \"I would like to, because\\nyou seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred\\nspirit although you don\\'t look very much like it. But it is my duty to\\ngo home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind\\nlady who has taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but\\nit is very discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on\\nthe bed. But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive\\nDiana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.\"\\n\"I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me\\noccasionally,\" said Miss Barry.\\nThat evening Miss Barry gave Diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the\\nsenior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.\\n\"I\\'ve made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better\\nacquainted with that Anne-girl,\" she said frankly. \"She amuses me, and\\nat my time of life an amusing person is a rarity.\"',\n",

The maples in Lover\\'s Lane were red budded\\nand little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad\\'s Bubble. Away up in\\nthe barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane\\'s place, the Mayflowers blossomed\\nout, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the\\nschool girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming\\nhome in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of\\nflowery spoil.\\n\"I\\'m so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no\\nMayflowers,\" said Anne. \"Diana says perhaps they have something better,\\nbut there couldn\\'t be anything better than Mayflowers, could there,\\nMarilla? And Diana says if they don\\'t know what they are like they don\\'t\\nmiss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it\\nwould be _tragic_, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and _not_\\nto miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think\\nthey must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this\\nis their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our\\nlunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.\\nCharlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because\\nhe wouldn\\'t take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very _fashionable_\\nto dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews\\nand I heard him to say \\'sweets to the sweet.\\' He got that out of a\\nbook, I know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered some\\nMayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can\\'t tell you the\\nperson\\'s name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We\\nmade wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the\\ntime came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two,\\nwith our bouquets and wreaths, singing \\'My Home on the Hill.\\' Oh, it was\\nso thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane\\'s folks rushed out to see us\\nand everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a\\nreal sensation.\"',\n",

It was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its\\nvivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had\\ntapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and\\nmoonshine. Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of Anne\\'s freshly\\nironed school aprons. She hung them over a chair and sat down with\\na short sigh.

I\\nwas firmly resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to\\nimagine anything, but keep my thoughts on facts. I did pretty well until\\nI put the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to\\nimagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a\\nhandsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that\\nis how I came to forget the pie. I didn\\'t know I starched the\\nhandkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a\\nname for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook. It\\'s the\\nmost ravishing spot, Marilla. There are two maple trees on it and the\\nbrook flows right around it. At last it struck me that it would be\\nsplendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the Queen\\'s\\nbirthday. Both Diana and I are very loyal. But I\\'m sorry about that pie\\nand the handkerchiefs. I wanted to be extra good today because it\\'s an\\nanniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?\"\\n\"No, I can\\'t think of anything special.\"\\n\"Oh, Marilla, it was the day I came to Green Gables. I shall never\\nforget it. It was the turning point in my life. Of course it wouldn\\'t\\nseem so important to you. I\\'ve been here for a year and I\\'ve been so\\nhappy. Of course, I\\'ve had my troubles, but one can live down troubles.\\nAre you sorry you kept me, Marilla?\"\\n\"No, I can\\'t say I\\'m sorry,\" said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how\\nshe could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, \"no, not exactly\\nsorry.

I\\'d like to catch you!\"\\n\"I can\\'t go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla,\" cried Anne desperately.\\nMarilla stared.\\n\"The Haunted Wood! Are you crazy? What under the canopy is the Haunted\\nWood?\"\\n\"The spruce wood over the brook,\" said Anne in a whisper.\\n\"Fiddlesticks! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who\\nhas been telling you such stuff?\"\\n\"Nobody,\" confessed Anne. \"Diana and I just imagined the wood was\\nhaunted. All the places around here are so--so--_commonplace_. We just got\\nthis up for our own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is\\nso very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it\\'s so\\ngloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There\\'s a white\\nlady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings\\nher hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when there is to be a\\ndeath in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the\\ncorner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers\\non your hand--so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And\\nthere\\'s a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower\\nat you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldn\\'t go through the\\nHaunted Wood after dark now for anything. I\\'d be sure that white things\\nwould reach out from behind the trees and grab me.\"\\n\"Did ever anyone hear the like!\" ejaculated Marilla, who had\\nlistened in dumb amazement. \"Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you\\nbelieve all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?\"\\n\"Not believe _exactly_,\" faltered Anne. \"At least, I don\\'t believe it in\\ndaylight. But after dark, Marilla, it\\'s different. That is when ghosts\\nwalk.\"\\n\"There are no such things as ghosts, Anne.\"\\n\"Oh, but there are, Marilla,\" cried Anne eagerly. \"I know people who\\nhave seen them. And they are respectable people. Charlie Sloane says\\nthat his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night\\nafter he\\'d been buried for a year. You know Charlie Sloane\\'s grandmother\\nwouldn\\'t tell a story for anything. She\\'s a very religious woman. And\\nMrs. Thomas\\'s father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with\\nits head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. He said he knew it was the\\nspirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine\\ndays. He didn\\'t, but he died two years after, so you see it was really\\ntrue. And Ruby Gillis says--\"\\n\"Anne Shirley,\" interrupted Marilla firmly, \"I never want to hear you\\ntalking in this fashion again. I\\'ve had my doubts about that imagination\\nof yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, I\\nwon\\'t countenance any such doings. You\\'ll go right over to Barry\\'s, and\\nyou\\'ll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to\\nyou. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods\\nagain.\"\\nAnne might plead and cry as she liked--and did, for her terror was very\\nreal. Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce\\ngrove in mortal dread after nightfall. But Marilla was inexorable. She\\nmarched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her\\nto proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of\\nwailing ladies and headless specters beyond.\\n\"Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?\" sobbed Anne. \"What would you\\nfeel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?\"\\n\"I\\'ll risk it,\" said Marilla unfeelingly. \"You know I always mean what I\\nsay. I\\'ll cure you of imagining ghosts into places. March, now.\"',\n",

Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how\\nglad she\\'d be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she\\'d never\\nshed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a\\nhandkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn\\'t cry--because\\nshe hadn\\'t brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh,\\nMarilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful\\nfarewell speech beginning, \\'The time has come for us to part.\\' It was\\nvery affecting.

For all I was feeling so bad about Mr.\\nPhillips going away I couldn\\'t help taking a little interest in a new\\nminister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely,\\nof course--it wouldn\\'t do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally\\nlovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the\\nminister\\'s wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she\\ndresses so fashionably. Our new minister\\'s wife was dressed in blue\\nmuslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.\\nJane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for\\na minister\\'s wife, but I didn\\'t make any such uncharitable remark,\\nMarilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides,\\nshe\\'s only been a minister\\'s wife for a little while, so one should\\nmake allowances, shouldn\\'t they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde\\nuntil the manse is ready.\"\\nIf Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde\\'s that evening, was actuated by\\nany motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had\\nborrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most\\nof the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes\\nnever expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the\\nborrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife,\\nwas a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement\\nwhere sensations were few and far between.\\nOld Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in\\nimagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a\\nwidower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that\\ngossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year\\nof his sojourn. In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and\\ndeparted amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection\\nborn of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his\\nshortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a\\nvariety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various\\ncandidates and \"supplies\" who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on\\ntrial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers\\nin Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the\\ncorner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and\\ndiscussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from\\nprinciple to criticize ministers in any shape or form.\\n\"I don\\'t think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew\" was Anne\\'s final\\nsumming up. \"Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his\\nworst fault was just like Mr. Bentley\\'s--he had no imagination. And Mr.\\nTerry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in\\nthe matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology\\nwasn\\'t sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,\\nbut he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church;\\nhe was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,\\nmustn\\'t you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive;\\nbut Mrs. Lynde says he isn\\'t married, or even engaged, because she made\\nspecial inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have\\na young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the\\ncongregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing\\nwoman, isn\\'t she, Matthew? I\\'m very glad they\\'ve called Mr. Allan. I\\nliked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he\\nmeant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.\\nMrs. Lynde says he isn\\'t perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn\\'t\\nexpect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year,\\nand anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly\\non all the points of doctrine. And she knows his wife\\'s people and they\\nare most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde\\nsays that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman\\nmake an ideal combination for a minister\\'s family.\"\\nThe new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still\\non their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for\\ntheir chosen lifework.

With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love.\\nShe had discovered another kindred spirit.\\n\"Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely,\" she announced one Sunday afternoon.\\n\"She\\'s taken our class and she\\'s a splendid teacher. She said right away\\nshe didn\\'t think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions,\\nand you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I\\'ve always thought. She\\nsaid we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many.\\nI\\'m good at asking questions, Marilla.\"\\n\"I believe you,\" was Marilla\\'s emphatic comment.\\n\"Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was\\nto be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn\\'t think that was a\\nvery proper question to ask because it hadn\\'t any connection with the\\nlesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions\\' den--but Mrs. Allan\\njust smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a\\nlovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had\\ndimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I\\'m not half so skinny as I was when I\\ncame here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence\\npeople for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence\\nother people for good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew\\nbefore that religion was such a cheerful thing. I always thought it\\nwas kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan\\'s isn\\'t, and I\\'d like to be a\\nChristian if I could be one like her. I wouldn\\'t want to be one like Mr.\\nSuperintendent Bell.\"\\n\"It\\'s very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,\" said Marilla\\nseverely. \"Mr. Bell is a real good man.\"\\n\"Oh, of course he\\'s good,\" agreed Anne, \"but he doesn\\'t seem to get any\\ncomfort out of it. If I could be good I\\'d dance and sing all day because\\nI was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and\\nof course it wouldn\\'t be dignified in a minister\\'s wife. But I can just\\nfeel she\\'s glad she\\'s a Christian and that she\\'d be one even if she\\ncould get to heaven without it.\"\\n\"I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,\" said\\nMarilla reflectively. \"They\\'ve been most everywhere but here. Let me\\nsee. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don\\'t say a\\nword to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he\\'d find some\\nexcuse to be away that day. He\\'d got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn\\'t\\nmind him, but he\\'s going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new\\nminister, and a new minister\\'s wife will frighten him to death.\"\\n\"I\\'ll be as secret as the dead,\" assured Anne. \"But oh, Marilla, will\\nyou let me make a cake for the occasion? I\\'d love to do something for\\nMrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.\"\\n\"You can make a layer cake,\" promised Marilla.\\nMonday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables.\\nHaving the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important\\nundertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of\\nthe Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She\\ntalked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they\\nsat on the big red stones by the Dryad\\'s Bubble and made rainbows in the\\nwater with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.\\n\"Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I\\'m to make in the\\nmorning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just\\nbefore teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy\\ntwo days of it. It\\'s such a responsibility having a minister\\'s family to\\ntea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see\\nour pantry. It\\'s a sight to behold. We\\'re going to have jellied chicken\\nand cold tongue. We\\'re to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and\\nwhipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies,\\nand fruit cake, and Marilla\\'s famous yellow plum preserves that she\\nkeeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and\\nbiscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister\\nis dyspeptic and can\\'t eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic,\\nbut I don\\'t think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to\\nhave had a bad effect on him. I just grow cold when I think of my layer\\ncake. Oh, Diana, what if it shouldn\\'t be good! I dreamed last night that\\nI was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a\\nhead.\"\\n\"It\\'ll be good, all right,\" assured Diana, who was a very comfortable\\nsort of friend. \"I\\'m sure that piece of the one you made that we had for\\nlunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant.\"\\n\"Yes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just\\nwhen you especially want them to be good,\" sighed Anne, setting a\\nparticularly well-balsamed twig afloat. \"However, I suppose I shall\\njust have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh,\\nlook, Diana, what a lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come',\n",

       "   'text': 'out after we go away and take it for a scarf?\"\\n\"You know there is no such thing as a dryad,\" said Diana. Diana\\'s mother\\nhad found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over\\nit. As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights\\nof imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of\\nbelief even in harmless dryads.\\n\"But it\\'s so easy to imagine there is,\" said Anne. \"Every night before\\nI go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really\\nsitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes\\nI look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don\\'t\\ngive up your faith in the dryad!\"\\nWednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too\\nexcited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of\\nher dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short\\nof absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary\\nmatters that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake.\\nWhen she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.\\n\"I\\'m sure I haven\\'t forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you\\nthink it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn\\'t good? I\\nused it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of\\ngetting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated.\\nMrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says\\nwe\\'ll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what\\nif that cake doesn\\'t rise?\"\\n\"We\\'ll have plenty without it\" was Marilla\\'s unimpassioned way of\\nlooking at the subject.\\nThe cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and\\nfeathery as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together\\nwith layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it\\nand possibly asking for another piece!\\n\"You\\'ll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,\" she said. \"Can I\\nfix the table with ferns and wild roses?\"\\n\"I think that\\'s all nonsense,\" sniffed Marilla. \"In my opinion it\\'s the\\neatables that matter and not flummery decorations.\"\\n\"Mrs. Barry had _her_ table decorated,\" said Anne, who was not entirely\\nguiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, \"and the minister paid her an\\nelegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the\\npalate.\"\\n\"Well, do as you like,\" said Marilla, who was quite determined not to\\nbe surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. \"Only mind you leave enough\\nroom for the dishes and the food.\"\\nAnne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that\\nshould leave Mrs. Barry\\'s nowhere. Having abundance of roses and ferns\\nand a very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a\\nthing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they\\nexclaimed in chorus over it loveliness.\\n\"It\\'s Anne\\'s doings,\" said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs.\\nAllan\\'s approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.\\nMatthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness\\nand Anne knew how. He had been in such a state of shyness and\\nnervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him\\nin hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes\\nand white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.\\nHe never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be\\nexpected.\\nAll went merry as a marriage bell until Anne\\'s layer cake was passed.\\nMrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety,\\ndeclined it. But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne\\'s face, said\\nsmilingly:\\n\"Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose\\nfor you.\"\\n\"In that case I must sample it,\" laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to\\na plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.\\nMrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression\\ncrossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away\\nat it. Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.\\n\"Anne Shirley!\" she exclaimed, \"what on earth did you put into that\\ncake?\"\\n\"Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla,\" cried Anne with a look of\\nanguish. \"Oh, isn\\'t it all right?\"\\n\"All right! It\\'s simply horrible. Mr. Allan, don\\'t try to eat it. Anne,\\ntaste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?\"\\n\"Vanilla,\" said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting\\nthe cake. \"Only vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking\\npowder. I had my suspicions of that bak--\"\\n\"Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you\\nused.\"\\nAnne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially\\nfilled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, \"Best Vanilla.\"\\nMarilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.\\n\"Mercy on us, Anne, you\\'ve flavored that cake with _Anodyne Liniment_. I\\nbroke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an\\nold empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it\\'s partly my fault--I should have\\nwarned you--but for pity\\'s sake why couldn\\'t you have smelled it?\"\\nAnne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.\\n\"I couldn\\'t--I had such a cold!\" and with this she fairly fled to the\\ngable chamber, where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who\\nrefuses to be comforted.\\nPresently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the\\nroom.\\n\"Oh, Marilla,\" sobbed Anne, without looking up, \"I\\'m disgraced forever.\\nI shall never be able to live this down. It will get out--things always\\ndo get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I\\nshall have to tell her the truth. I shall always be pointed at as the\\ngirl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil--the boys in school\\nwill never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark\\nof Christian pity don\\'t tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes\\nafter this. I\\'ll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but\\nI cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she\\'ll think I\\ntried to poison her. Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried\\nto poison her benefactor. But the liniment isn\\'t poisonous. It\\'s meant\\nto be taken internally--although not in cakes. Won\\'t you tell Mrs. Allan\\nso, Marilla?\"\\n\"Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself,\" said a merry voice.\\nAnne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her bed, surveying her with\\nlaughing eyes.\\n\"My dear little girl, you mustn\\'t cry like this,\" she said, genuinely\\ndisturbed by Anne\\'s tragic face. \"Why, it\\'s all just a funny mistake\\nthat anybody might make.\"\\n\"Oh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake,\" said Anne forlornly. \"And\\nI wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan.\"\\n\"Yes, I know, dear. And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and\\nthoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now,\\nyou mustn\\'t cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower\\ngarden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I\\nwant to see it, for I\\'m very much interested in flowers.\"\\nAnne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it\\nwas really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit. Nothing\\nmore was said about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away\\nAnne found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been\\nexpected, considering that terrible incident. Nevertheless, she sighed\\ndeeply.\\n\"Marilla, isn\\'t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no\\nmistakes in it yet?\"\\n\"I\\'ll warrant you\\'ll make plenty in it,\" said Marilla. \"I never saw your\\nbeat for making mistakes, Anne.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'Anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of\\n\"etiquette,\" for she came home through the twilight, under a great,\\nhigh-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in\\na beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting\\non the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly\\nhead in Marilla\\'s gingham lap.\\nA cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims\\nof firry western hills and whistling through the poplars. One clear star\\nhung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover\\'s\\nLane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them\\nas she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were\\nall tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.\\n\"Oh, Marilla, I\\'ve had a most _fascinating_ time. I feel that I have not\\nlived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never\\nbe invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me\\nat the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy,\\nwith dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a\\nseraph. I really think I\\'d like to be a minister\\'s wife when I grow up,\\nMarilla. A minister mightn\\'t mind my red hair because he wouldn\\'t be\\nthinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to\\nbe naturally good and I\\'ll never be that, so I suppose there\\'s no use in\\nthinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others\\nare not. I\\'m one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I\\'m full of original\\nsin. No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success\\nof it as those who are naturally good. It\\'s a good deal like geometry,\\nI expect. But don\\'t you think the trying so hard ought to count for\\nsomething? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her\\npassionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs.\\nAllan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are\\nothers, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You\\nknow you _ought_ to love them because they know so much and are such\\nactive workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of\\nit all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the\\nmanse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her name was Laurette\\nBradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred\\nspirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I\\nthink I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs.\\nAllan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too.\\nMrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the\\nSunday-school choir after this. You can\\'t think how I was thrilled at\\nthe mere thought. I\\'ve longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir,\\nas Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to.\\nLauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the\\nWhite Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta\\nsays that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in\\naid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White\\nSands people to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself\\nsomeday. I just gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I\\nhad a heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything--about Mrs. Thomas and\\nthe twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and\\nmy troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs.\\nAllan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don\\'t know how that\\nencouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what\\ndo you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it\\'s\\na lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn\\'t that a romantic name? Mrs.\\nLynde says they\\'ve never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she\\nthinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid\\nto have a lady teacher, and I really don\\'t see how I\\'m going to live\\nthrough the two weeks before school begins. I\\'m so impatient to see\\nher.\"',\n",

You\\nfind out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came\\nto see me, and he\\'s really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of\\ncourse; but still I like him and I\\'m awfully sorry I ever criticized his\\nprayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into\\nthe habit of saying them as if he didn\\'t. He could get over that if he\\'d\\ntake a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard\\nI tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me\\nall about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem\\nso strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my\\nimagination has its limits, for I can\\'t imagine _that_. When I try to\\nimagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just\\nas he looks in Sunday school, only small. Now, it\\'s so easy to imagine\\nMrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen\\ntimes. Isn\\'t that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a minister\\'s\\nwife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to\\nhave visit you, too. She never tells you it\\'s your own fault and she\\nhopes you\\'ll be a better girl on account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told\\nme that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that\\nmade me feel she might hope I\\'d be a better girl but didn\\'t really\\nbelieve I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her as\\npolitely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk\\na ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden\\nof remorse all her life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She\\'s been\\nover every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad\\nwhen I can go to school for I\\'ve heard such exciting things about the\\nnew teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she\\nhas the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses\\nbeautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else\\'s in\\nAvonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody\\nhas to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it\\'s just glorious to\\nthink of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie\\nhas so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are\\npreparing a dialogue, called \\'A Morning Visit,\\' for next Friday. And the\\nFriday afternoons they don\\'t have recitations Miss Stacy takes them\\nall to the woods for a \\'field\\' day and they study ferns and flowers\\nand birds. And they have physical culture exercises every morning and\\nevening. Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all\\ncomes of having a lady teacher. But I think it must be splendid and I\\nbelieve I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'contortions paled before a project which Miss Stacy brought forward in\\nNovember. This was that the scholars of Avonlea school should get up\\na concert and hold it in the hall on Christmas Night, for the laudable\\npurpose of helping to pay for a schoolhouse flag. The pupils one and\\nall taking graciously to this plan, the preparations for a program\\nwere begun at once. And of all the excited performers-elect none was so\\nexcited as Anne Shirley, who threw herself into the undertaking heart\\nand soul, hampered as she was by Marilla\\'s disapproval. Marilla thought\\nit all rank foolishness.\\n\"It\\'s just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that\\nought to be put on your lessons,\" she grumbled. \"I don\\'t approve of\\nchildren\\'s getting up concerts and racing about to practices. It makes\\nthem vain and forward and fond of gadding.\"\\n\"But think of the worthy object,\" pleaded Anne. \"A flag will cultivate a\\nspirit of patriotism, Marilla.\"\\n\"Fudge! There\\'s precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of\\nyou. All you want is a good time.\"\\n\"Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn\\'t it all right? Of\\ncourse it\\'s real nice to be getting up a concert. We\\'re going to have\\nsix choruses and Diana is to sing a solo. I\\'m in two dialogues--\\'The\\nSociety for the Suppression of Gossip\\' and \\'The Fairy Queen.\\' The boys\\nare going to have a dialogue too. And I\\'m to have two recitations,\\nMarilla. I just tremble when I think of it, but it\\'s a nice thrilly kind\\nof tremble. And we\\'re to have a tableau at the last--\\'Faith, Hope and\\nCharity.\\' Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with\\nflowing hair. I\\'m to be Hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes\\nuplifted. I\\'m going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don\\'t be\\nalarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one\\nof them, and it\\'s really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla.\\nJosie Pye is sulky because she didn\\'t get the part she wanted in\\nthe dialogue. She wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been\\nridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy\\nqueens must be slender. Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be\\none of her maids of honor. Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is\\njust as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie\\nsays. I\\'m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis\\nis going to lend me her slippers because I haven\\'t any of my own. It\\'s\\nnecessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You couldn\\'t imagine\\na fairy wearing boots, could you? Especially with copper toes? We are\\ngoing to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with\\npink tissue-paper roses in them. And we are all to march in two by two\\nafter the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the\\norgan. Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am,\\nbut don\\'t you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?\"\\n\"All I hope is that you\\'ll behave yourself. I\\'ll be heartily glad when\\nall this fuss is over and you\\'ll be able to settle down. You are simply\\ngood for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and\\ngroans and tableaus. As for your tongue, it\\'s a marvel it\\'s not clean',\n",

Presently they came trooping\\nthrough the hall and out into the kitchen, laughing and chattering\\ngaily.

And what worried Matthew was that the difference\\nimpressed him as being something that should not exist. Anne had a\\nbrighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more delicate features\\nthan the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to take note\\nof these things; but the difference that disturbed him did not consist\\nin any of these respects.

He could not refer it to Marilla, who, he felt, would be\\nquite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she\\nsaw between Anne and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their\\ntongues quiet while Anne never did.

It had been a very\\nmild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but\\njust enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne\\npeeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs\\nin the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches\\nand wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were\\nstretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that\\nwas glorious. Anne ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed\\nthrough Green Gables.\\n\"Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn\\'t it a lovely\\nChristmas? I\\'m so glad it\\'s white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn\\'t\\nseem real, does it? I don\\'t like green Christmases. They\\'re not\\ngreen--they\\'re just nasty faded browns and grays. What makes people call\\nthem green? Why--why--Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew!\"\\nMatthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and\\nheld it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be\\ncontemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene\\nout of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air.\\nAnne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty\\nit was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt\\nwith dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the\\nmost fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.\\nBut the sleeves--they were the crowning glory! Long elbow cuffs, and\\nabove them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of\\nbrown-silk ribbon.\\n\"That\\'s a Christmas present for you, Anne,\" said Matthew shyly.\\n\"Why--why--Anne, don\\'t you like it? Well now--well now.\"\\nFor Anne\\'s eyes had suddenly filled with tears.\\n\"Like it! Oh, Matthew!\" Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped\\nher hands. \"Matthew, it\\'s perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank you\\nenough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy\\ndream.\"\\n\"Well, well, let us have breakfast,\" interrupted Marilla. \"I must say,\\nAnne, I don\\'t think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it\\nfor you, see that you take good care of it. There\\'s a hair ribbon Mrs.\\nLynde left for you. It\\'s brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in.\"\\n\"I don\\'t see how I\\'m going to eat breakfast,\" said Anne rapturously.\\n\"Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I\\'d rather\\nfeast my eyes on that dress. I\\'m so glad that puffed sleeves are still\\nfashionable. It did seem to me that I\\'d never get over it if they went\\nout before I had a dress with them. I\\'d never have felt quite satisfied,\\nyou see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel\\nthat I ought to be a very good girl indeed. It\\'s at times like this I\\'m\\nsorry I\\'m not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will\\nbe in future.

On Anne\\'s birthday they were tripping lightly\\ndown it, keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss\\nStacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on \"A\\nWinter\\'s Walk in the Woods,\" and it behooved them to be observant.\\n\"Just think, Diana, I\\'m thirteen years old today,\" remarked Anne in an\\nawed voice. \"I can scarcely realize that I\\'m in my teens. When I woke\\nthis morning it seemed to me that everything must be different. You\\'ve\\nbeen thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn\\'t seem such a novelty\\nto you as it does to me.

I\\nsimply can\\'t talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech,\\nso I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I\\'m trying to\\nbe as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she\\'s perfect.\\nMr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she\\ntreads on and she doesn\\'t really think it right for a minister to\\nset his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even\\nministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody\\nelse. I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting\\nsins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it\\'s proper\\nto talk about on Sundays and that is one of them. My besetting sin is\\nimagining too much and forgetting my duties. I\\'m striving very hard\\nto overcome it and now that I\\'m really thirteen perhaps I\\'ll get on\\nbetter.\"\\n\"In four more years we\\'ll be able to put our hair up,\" said Diana.\\n\"Alice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I think\\nthat\\'s ridiculous. I shall wait until I\\'m seventeen.\"\\n\"If I had Alice Bell\\'s crooked nose,\" said Anne decidedly, \"I\\nwouldn\\'t--but there! I won\\'t say what I was going to because it was\\nextremely uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and\\nthat\\'s vanity. I\\'m afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I\\nheard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to\\nme. Oh, Diana, look, there\\'s a rabbit. That\\'s something to remember for\\nour woods composition. I really think the woods are just as lovely in\\nwinter as in summer.

The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to write a\\nstory out of our own heads!\"\\n\"Why, it\\'s as easy as wink,\" said Anne.\\n\"It\\'s easy for you because you have an imagination,\" retorted Diana,\\n\"but what would you do if you had been born without one? I suppose you\\nhave your composition all done?\"\\nAnne nodded, trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing\\nmiserably.\\n\"I wrote it last Monday evening. It\\'s called \\'The Jealous Rival; or In\\nDeath Not Divided.\\' I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and\\nnonsense. Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine. That is\\nthe kind of critic I like. It\\'s a sad, sweet story. I just cried like\\na child while I was writing it. It\\'s about two beautiful maidens called\\nCordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village\\nand were devotedly attached to each other. Cordelia was a regal brunette\\nwith a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes. Geraldine was\\na queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.\"\\n\"I never saw anybody with purple eyes,\" said Diana dubiously.\\n\"Neither did I. I just imagined them. I wanted something out of the\\ncommon. Geraldine had an alabaster brow too. I\\'ve found out what an\\nalabaster brow is. That is one of the advantages of being thirteen. You\\nknow so much more than you did when you were only twelve.\"\\n\"Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?\" asked Diana, who was\\nbeginning to feel rather interested in their fate.\\n\"They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen. Then Bertram\\nDeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair\\nGeraldine. He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a\\ncarriage, and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three\\nmiles; because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up. I found\\nit rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to\\ngo by. I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed\\nbecause I thought she\\'d likely be an authority on the subject, having so\\nmany sisters married. Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when\\nMalcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan. She said Malcolm told Susan\\nthat his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, \\'What\\ndo you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?\\' And Susan said,\\n\\'Yes--no--I don\\'t know--let me see\\'--and there they were, engaged as\\nquick as that. But I didn\\'t think that sort of a proposal was a very\\nromantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could.\\nI made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees,\\nalthough Ruby Gillis says it isn\\'t done nowadays. Geraldine accepted\\nhim in a speech a page long. I can tell you I took a lot of trouble\\nwith that speech. I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my\\nmasterpiece. Bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace\\nand told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour, for he was\\nimmensely wealthy. But then, alas, shadows began to darken over their\\npath. Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when\\nGeraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious,\\nespecially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring. All her\\naffection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she\\nshould never marry Bertram. But she pretended to be Geraldine\\'s friend\\nthe same as ever. One evening they were standing on the bridge over a\\nrushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were alone, pushed\\nGeraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, \\'Ha, ha, ha.\\' But Bertram\\nsaw it all and he at once plunged into the current, exclaiming, \\'I\\nwill save thee, my peerless Geraldine.\\' But alas, he had forgotten he\\ncouldn\\'t swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other\\'s arms.\\nTheir bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the\\none grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana. It\\'s so much\\nmore romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding. As for\\nCordelia, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic\\nasylum. I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime.\"',\n",

Marilla, as she picked her steps\\nalong the damp lane, thought that it was really a satisfaction to know\\nthat she was going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table\\nnicely spread for tea, instead of to the cold comfort of old Aid meeting\\nevenings before Anne had come to Green Gables.\\nConsequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black\\nout, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and\\nirritated. She had told Anne to be sure and have tea ready at five\\no\\'clock, but now she must hurry to take off her second-best dress and\\nprepare the meal herself against Matthew\\'s return from plowing.\\n\"I\\'ll settle Miss Anne when she comes home,\" said Marilla grimly, as\\nshe shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was\\nstrictly necessary. Matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for\\nhis tea in his corner. \"She\\'s gadding off somewhere with Diana, writing\\nstories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never\\nthinking once about the time or her duties. She\\'s just got to be pulled\\nup short and sudden on this sort of thing. I don\\'t care if Mrs. Allan\\ndoes say she\\'s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew. She may\\nbe bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and there\\'s\\nnever any knowing what shape it\\'ll break out in next. Just as soon as\\nshe grows out of one freak she takes up with another. But there! Here I\\nam saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at\\nthe Aid today. I was real glad when Mrs. Allan spoke up for Anne, for\\nif she hadn\\'t I know I\\'d have said something too sharp to Rachel before\\neverybody. Anne\\'s got plenty of faults, goodness knows, and far be it\\nfrom me to deny it. But I\\'m bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde, who\\'d\\npick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea. Just\\nthe same, Anne has no business to leave the house like this when I told\\nher she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things. I must\\nsay, with all her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy\\nbefore and I\\'m real sorry to find her so now.\"',\n",

In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine\\nto scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall\\nof blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her\\nbarge through which the water was literally pouring. That sharp stake at\\nthe landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat. Anne\\ndid not know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was\\nin a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long\\nbefore it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left\\nbehind at the landing!\\nAnne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she was\\nwhite to the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession.

I prayed, Mrs. Allan, most earnestly,\\nbut I didn\\'t shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could\\nsave me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge\\npiles for me to climb up on it. You know the piles are just old tree\\ntrunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them. It was\\nproper to pray, but I had to do my part by watching out and right well\\nI knew it. I just said, \\'Dear God, please take the flat close to a pile\\nand I\\'ll do the rest,\\' over and over again. Under such circumstances you\\ndon\\'t think much about making a flowery prayer. But mine was answered,\\nfor the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf\\nand the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential\\nstub. And there I was, Mrs. Allan, clinging to that slippery old pile\\nwith no way of getting up or down. It was a very unromantic position,\\nbut I didn\\'t think about that at the time. You don\\'t think much about\\nromance when you have just escaped from a watery grave. I said a\\ngrateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on\\ntight, for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get\\nback to dry land.\"',\n",

The affair of\\nthe amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn\\'t belong\\nto me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run\\naway with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in\\ncooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair\\nand nose now--at least, very seldom. And today\\'s mistake is going to\\ncure me of being too romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it is\\nno use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in\\ntowered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated\\nnow. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me\\nin this respect, Marilla.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure I hope so,\" said Marilla skeptically.\\nBut Matthew, who had been sitting mutely in his corner, laid a hand on\\nAnne\\'s shoulder when Marilla had gone out.\\n\"Don\\'t give up all your romance, Anne,\" he whispered shyly, \"a little\\nof it is a good thing--not too much, of course--but keep a little of it,\\nAnne, keep a little of it.\"',\n",

From first to last it was crowded with delights.\\nOn Wednesday Miss Barry took them to the Exhibition grounds and kept\\nthem there all day.\\n\"It was splendid,\" Anne related to Marilla later on. \"I never imagined\\nanything so interesting. I don\\'t really know which department was the\\nmost interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the\\nfancywork best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was\\nreal glad she did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I\\'m\\nimproving, don\\'t you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie\\'s\\nsuccess? Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples\\nand Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig. Diana said she thought it was\\nridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs,\\nbut I don\\'t see why. Do you? She said she would always think of it after\\nthis when he was praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a\\nprize for painting, and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter\\nand cheese. So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn\\'t it? Mrs.\\nLynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her\\nuntil I saw her familiar face among all those strangers. There\\nwere thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel dreadfully\\ninsignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see\\nthe horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn\\'t go; she said horse racing was an\\nabomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty\\nto set a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I\\ndon\\'t believe Mrs. Lynde\\'s absence would ever be noticed. I don\\'t think,\\nthough, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_\\nawfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me\\nten cents that the red horse would win. I didn\\'t believe he would, but\\nI refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about\\neverything, and I felt sure it wouldn\\'t do to tell her that. It\\'s always\\nwrong to do anything you can\\'t tell the minister\\'s wife. It\\'s as good as\\nan extra conscience to have a minister\\'s wife for your friend. And I was\\nvery glad I didn\\'t bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and I would have\\nlost ten cents. So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a man\\ngo up in a balloon. I\\'d love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would\\nbe simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten\\ncents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you.

I just sat in enraptured\\nsilence. Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin\\nand diamonds. But when she began to sing I never thought about anything\\nelse. Oh, I can\\'t tell you how I felt. But it seemed to me that it could\\nnever be hard to be good any more. I felt like I do when I look up to\\nthe stars. Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears.\\nI was so sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn\\'t see\\nhow I was ever to return to common life again. She said she thought if\\nwe went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream\\nit might help me. That sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found\\nit true. The ice cream was delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and\\ndissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o\\'clock at night.\\nDiana said she believed she was born for city life. Miss Barry asked\\nme what my opinion was, but I said I would have to think it over very\\nseriously before I could tell her what I really thought. So I thought it\\nover after I went to bed. That is the best time to think things out. And\\nI came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasn\\'t born for city life and\\nthat I was glad of it. It\\'s nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant\\nrestaurants at eleven o\\'clock at night once in a while; but as a regular\\nthing I\\'d rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind\\nof knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that\\nthe wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. I told Miss Barry\\nso at breakfast the next morning and she laughed. Miss Barry generally\\nlaughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things.

I meant to tell you, Marilla, honestly\\nI did, but I forgot. Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school\\nyesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian\\nhistory. Jane Andrews lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour,\\nand I had just got to the chariot race when school went in. I was simply\\nwild to know how it turned out--although I felt sure Ben Hur must win,\\nbecause it wouldn\\'t be poetical justice if he didn\\'t--so I spread the\\nhistory open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and\\nmy knee. I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know,\\nwhile all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it\\nthat I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at\\nonce I just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so\\nreproachful-like. I can\\'t tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla,\\nespecially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur\\naway, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and\\ntalked to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I\\nwas wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly,\\nI was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a\\nhistory when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that\\nmoment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I\\ncried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I\\'d never do such\\na thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking\\nat Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned\\nout. But Miss Stacy said she wouldn\\'t require that, and she forgave me\\nfreely. So I think it wasn\\'t very kind of her to come up here to you\\nabout it after all.\"\\n\"Miss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me, Anne, and its only your\\nguilty conscience that\\'s the matter with you.

Diana Barry did not, as her parents\\ndid not intend to send her to Queen\\'s. This seemed nothing short of a\\ncalamity to Anne. Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the\\ncroup, had she and Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when\\nthe Queen\\'s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and\\nAnne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through\\nthe Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep\\nher seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. A lump\\ncame into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her\\nuplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. Not for worlds\\nwould Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears.\\n\"But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of\\ndeath, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go\\nout alone,\" she said mournfully that night. \"I thought how splendid it\\nwould have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance,\\ntoo. But we can\\'t have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs.\\nLynde says. Mrs. Lynde isn\\'t exactly a comforting person sometimes, but\\nthere\\'s no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the\\nQueen\\'s class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby\\nare just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their\\nambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets\\nthrough, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote\\nher whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid\\na salary for teaching, but a husband won\\'t pay you anything, and growls\\nif you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks\\nfrom mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a\\nperfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she\\nis just going to college for education\\'s sake, because she won\\'t have to\\nearn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who\\nare living on charity--_they_ have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to\\nbe a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn\\'t be anything else with a name\\nlike that to live up to. I hope it isn\\'t wicked of me, Marilla, but\\nreally the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.\\nHe\\'s such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little\\nblue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will\\nbe more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he\\'s\\ngoing to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde\\nsays he\\'ll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest\\npeople, and it\\'s only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.\"',\n",

Previously the\\nrivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt\\nthat Gilbert was as determined to be first in class as Anne was. He was\\na foeman worthy of her steel. The other members of the class tacitly\\nacknowledged their superiority, and never dreamed of trying to compete\\nwith them.\\nSince the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea\\nfor forgiveness, Gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry,\\nhad evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of Anne Shirley. He\\ntalked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with\\nthem, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the\\nother of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley\\nhe simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be\\nignored. It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head\\nthat she did not care. Deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart\\nshe knew that she did care, and that if she had that chance of the Lake\\nof Shining Waters again she would answer very differently. All at\\nonce, as it seemed, and to her secret dismay, she found that the old\\nresentment she had cherished against him was gone--gone just when she\\nmost needed its sustaining power. It was in vain that she recalled every\\nincident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel\\nthe old satisfying anger. That day by the pond had witnessed its last\\nspasmodic flicker. Anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten\\nwithout knowing it. But it was too late.\\nAnd at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should\\never suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn\\'t been\\nso proud and horrid! She determined to \"shroud her feelings in deepest\\noblivion,\" and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so\\nsuccessfully that Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as\\nhe seemed, could not console himself with any belief that Anne felt his\\nretaliatory scorn. The only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed\\nCharlie Sloane, unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly.',\n",

       "   'text': '\"I feel just like studying with might and main,\" she declared as she\\nbrought her books down from the attic. \"Oh, you good old friends, I\\'m\\nglad to see your honest faces once more--yes, even you, geometry. I\\'ve\\nhad a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I\\'m rejoicing as a\\nstrong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesn\\'t Mr.\\nAllan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every\\nday and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up\\nand then we\\'ll be left and have to turn to and break in another green\\npreacher. But I don\\'t see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you,\\nMarilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we\\nhave him. If I were a man I think I\\'d be a minister. They can have\\nsuch an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be\\nthrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers\\' hearts. Why\\ncan\\'t women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was\\nshocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might\\nbe female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank\\ngoodness we hadn\\'t got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we\\nnever would. But I don\\'t see why. I think women would make splendid\\nministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or\\nanything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work.\\nI\\'m sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell\\nand I\\'ve no doubt she could preach too with a little practice.\"\\n\"Yes, I believe she could,\" said Marilla dryly. \"She does plenty of\\nunofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong\\nin Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.\"\\n\"Marilla,\" said Anne in a burst of confidence, \"I want to tell you\\nsomething and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me\\nterribly--on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about\\nsuch matters. I do really want to be good; and when I\\'m with you or Mrs.\\nAllan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what\\nwould please you and what you would approve of. But mostly when I\\'m with\\nMrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the\\nvery thing she tells me I oughtn\\'t to do. I feel irresistibly tempted\\nto do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you\\nthink it\\'s because I\\'m really bad and unregenerate?\"\\nMarilla looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.\\n\"If you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very\\neffect on me. I sometimes think she\\'d have more of an influence for\\ngood, as you say yourself, if she didn\\'t keep nagging people to do\\nright. There should have been a special commandment against nagging.\\nBut there, I shouldn\\'t talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she\\nmeans well. There isn\\'t a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks\\nher share of work.\"\\n\"I\\'m very glad you feel the same,\" said Anne decidedly. \"It\\'s so\\nencouraging. I shan\\'t worry so much over that after this. But I dare say\\nthere\\'ll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the\\ntime--things to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and\\nthere\\'s another right after. There are so many things to be thought over\\nand decided when you\\'re beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the\\ntime thinking them over and deciding what is right. It\\'s a serious thing\\nto grow up, isn\\'t it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as\\nyou and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up\\nsuccessfully, and I\\'m sure it will be my own fault if I don\\'t. I feel\\nit\\'s a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I\\ndon\\'t grow up right I can\\'t go back and begin over again. I\\'ve grown two\\ninches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby\\'s party. I\\'m\\nso glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty\\nand it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of course I know it\\nwasn\\'t really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie\\nPye has flounces on all her dresses. I know I\\'ll be able to study better\\nbecause of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my\\nmind about that flounce.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'Anne went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday Diana haunted\\nthe post office, as agreed, and got her letter.\\n\"Dearest Diana\" [wrote Anne],\\n\"Here it is Tuesday night and I\\'m writing this in the library at\\nBeechwood. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and\\nwished so much you were with me. I couldn\\'t \\'cram\\' because I\\'d promised\\nMiss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history\\nas it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were\\nlearned.\\n\"This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling\\nfor Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands\\nand they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn\\'t slept\\na wink and she didn\\'t believe I was strong enough to stand the grind\\nof the teacher\\'s course even if I did get through. There are times and\\nseasons even yet when I don\\'t feel that I\\'ve made any great headway in\\nlearning to like Josie Pye!\\n\"When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from\\nall over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting\\non the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth\\nhe was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over\\nand over to steady his nerves and for pity\\'s sake not to interrupt\\nhim, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot\\neverything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts\\nfirmly in their proper place!\\n\"When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and\\nI sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of\\nthe multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if\\nI looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear\\nacross the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English\\nexamination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled\\naround as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly\\nas I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green\\nGables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began\\nbeating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I\\nknew I could do something with _that_ paper anyhow.\\n\"At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in\\nthe afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully\\nmixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh,\\nDiana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it\\nit takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my\\nEuclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would\\nrecite it from now till tomorrow morning.\\n\"I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody\\nSpurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in\\nhistory and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he\\nwas going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a\\ncarpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to\\nstay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn\\'t.\\nSometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon\\nI\\'m always glad I\\'m a girl and not his sister.\\n\"Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just\\ndiscovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When\\nshe recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had\\nbeen with us.\\n\"Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as\\nMrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I\\nfail in geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I\\nthink I\\'d rather it didn\\'t go on if I failed!\\n\"Yours devotedly,\\n\"Anne\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'he hadn\\'t better vote Grit at the next election.\\nBut one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her open window,\\nfor the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the\\nworld, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with\\nflower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the\\nstir of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink\\nfrom the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the\\nspirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying\\ndown through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a\\nfluttering newspaper in her hand.\\nAnne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The\\npass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt\\nher. She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Diana\\ncame rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even\\nknocking, so great was her excitement.\\n\"Anne, you\\'ve passed,\" she cried, \"passed the _very first_--you and\\nGilbert both--you\\'re ties--but your name is first. Oh, I\\'m so proud!\"\\nDiana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne\\'s bed, utterly\\nbreathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp,\\noversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her\\nshaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper.\\nYes, she had passed--there was her name at the very top of a list of two\\nhundred! That moment was worth living for.\\n\"You did just splendidly, Anne,\" puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently\\nto sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a\\nword. \"Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes\\nago--it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won\\'t be here\\ntill tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over\\nlike a wild thing. You\\'ve all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon\\nand all, although he\\'s conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty\\nwell--they\\'re halfway up--and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through\\nwith three marks to spare, but you\\'ll see she\\'ll put on as many airs as\\nif she\\'d led. Won\\'t Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel\\nlike to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were\\nme I know I\\'d go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but\\nyou\\'re as calm and cool as a spring evening.\"\\n\"I\\'m just dazzled inside,\" said Anne. \"I want to say a hundred things,\\nand I can\\'t find words to say them in. I never dreamed of this--yes, I\\ndid too, just once! I let myself think _once_, \\'What if I should come out\\nfirst?\\' quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to\\nthink I could lead the Island. Excuse me a minute, Diana. I must run\\nright out to the field to tell Matthew. Then we\\'ll go up the road and\\ntell the good news to the others.\"\\nThey hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling\\nhay, and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at\\nthe lane fence.\\n\"Oh, Matthew,\" exclaimed Anne, \"I\\'ve passed and I\\'m first--or one of the\\nfirst! I\\'m not vain, but I\\'m thankful.\"\\n\"Well now, I always said it,\" said Matthew, gazing at the pass list\\ndelightedly. \"I knew you could beat them all easy.\"\\n\"You\\'ve done pretty well, I must say, Anne,\" said Marilla, trying to\\nhide her extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel\\'s critical eye. But that\\ngood soul said heartily:\\n\"I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in\\nsaying it. You\\'re a credit to your friends, Anne, that\\'s what, and we\\'re\\nall proud of you.\"\\nThat night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious\\nlittle talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open\\nwindow in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude\\nand aspiration that came straight from her heart. There was in it\\nthankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when\\nshe slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and\\nbeautiful as maidenhood might desire.',\n",

       "   'text': 'PUT on your white organdy, by all means, Anne,\" advised Diana\\ndecidedly.\\nThey were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only\\ntwilight--a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless\\nsky. A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into\\nburnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet\\nsummer sounds--sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway\\nvoices and laughter. But in Anne\\'s room the blind was drawn and the lamp\\nlighted, for an important toilet was being made.\\nThe east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that\\nnight four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to\\nthe marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept\\nin, Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and\\ndainty a nest as a young girl could desire.\\nThe velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of\\nAnne\\'s early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams\\nhad kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented\\nthem. The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that\\nsoftened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of\\npale-green art muslin. The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade\\ntapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few\\ngood pictures given Anne by Mrs. Allan. Miss Stacy\\'s photograph occupied\\nthe place of honor, and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh\\nflowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly\\nperfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance. There was no \"mahogany\\nfurniture,\" but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a\\ncushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin,\\na quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes\\npainted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a\\nlow white bed.\\nAnne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had\\ngot it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all\\nthe available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it\\nalong. Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir\\nhad been asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a\\nviolin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad;\\nand Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to\\nrecite.\\nAs Anne would have said at one time, it was \"an epoch in her life,\" and\\nshe was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in\\nthe seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his\\nAnne and Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather\\nthan admit it, and said she didn\\'t think it was very proper for a lot\\nof young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible\\nperson with them.\\nAnne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother\\nBilly in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and\\nboys were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from\\ntown, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.\\n\"Do you really think the organdy will be best?\" queried Anne anxiously.\\n\"I don\\'t think it\\'s as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it\\ncertainly isn\\'t so fashionable.\"\\n\"But it suits you ever so much better,\" said Diana. \"It\\'s so soft\\nand frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too\\ndressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.\"\\nAnne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for\\nnotable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much\\nsought after. She was looking very pretty herself on this particular\\nnight in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was\\nforever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so\\nher appearance was of minor importance. All her pains were bestowed upon\\nAnne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and\\ncombed and adorned to the Queen\\'s taste.\\n\"Pull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now\\nfor your slippers. I\\'m going to braid your hair in two thick braids,\\nand tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, don\\'t pull out a single\\ncurl over your forehead--just have the soft part. There is no way you do\\nyour hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a\\nMadonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose\\njust behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for\\nyou.\"\\n\"Shall I put my pearl beads on?\" asked Anne. \"Matthew brought me a\\nstring from town last week, and I know he\\'d like to see them on me.\"\\nDiana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically,\\nand finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied\\naround Anne\\'s slim milk-white throat.\\n\"There\\'s something so stylish about you, Anne,\" said Diana, with\\nunenvious admiration. \"You hold your head with such an air. I suppose\\nit\\'s your figure. I am just a dumpling. I\\'ve always been afraid of it,\\nand now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign\\nmyself to it.\"\\n\"But you have such dimples,\" said Anne, smiling affectionately into the\\npretty, vivacious face so near her own. \"Lovely dimples, like little\\ndents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream\\nwill never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn\\'t\\ncomplain. Am I all ready now?\"\\n\"All ready,\" assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt\\nfigure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a\\nmuch softer face. \"Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla.\\nDoesn\\'t she look lovely?\"\\nMarilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.\\n\"She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I\\nexpect she\\'ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew\\nwith it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy\\'s the\\nmost unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when\\nhe got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays.\\nTime was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for\\nAnne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything\\noff on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable,\\nand Matthew plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear\\nof the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'It was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel,\\nwhere she presently found herself. The electric lights dazzled her eyes,\\nthe perfume and hum bewildered her. She wished she were sitting down\\nin the audience with Diana and Jane, who seemed to be having a splendid\\ntime away at the back. She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink\\nsilk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress. The stout\\nlady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed Anne\\nthrough her eyeglasses until Anne, acutely sensitive of being so\\nscrutinized, felt that she must scream aloud; and the white-lace girl\\nkept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the \"country bumpkins\"\\nand \"rustic belles\" in the audience, languidly anticipating \"such fun\"\\nfrom the displays of local talent on the program. Anne believed that she\\nwould hate that white-lace girl to the end of life.\\nUnfortunately for Anne, a professional elocutionist was staying at the\\nhotel and had consented to recite. She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a\\nwonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems\\non her neck and in her dark hair. She had a marvelously flexible voice\\nand wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her\\nselection. Anne, forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the\\ntime, listened with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended\\nshe suddenly put her hands over her face. She could never get up and\\nrecite after that--never. Had she ever thought she could recite? Oh, if\\nshe were only back at Green Gables!\\nAt this unpropitious moment her name was called. Somehow Anne--who did\\nnot notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace\\ngirl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied\\ntherein if she had--got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front.\\nShe was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each\\nother\\'s hands in nervous sympathy.\\nAnne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as\\nshe had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience\\nas this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely.\\nEverything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of\\nladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of\\nwealth and culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches\\nat the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of\\nfriends and neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless\\ncritics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement\\nfrom her \"rustic\" efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and\\nmiserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness\\ncame over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would\\nhave fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt,\\nmust ever after be her portion if she did so.\\nBut suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the\\naudience, she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending\\nforward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once\\ntriumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert\\nwas merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and\\nof the effect produced by Anne\\'s slender white form and spiritual face\\nagainst a background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had\\ndriven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant\\nand taunting. But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if\\nshe had. She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage\\nand determination tingling over her like an electric shock. She _would\\nnot_ fail before Gilbert Blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her,\\nnever, never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her\\nrecitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of\\nthe room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored\\nto her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness\\nshe recited as she had never done before. When she finished there were\\nbursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing\\nwith shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken\\nby the stout lady in pink silk.\\n\"My dear, you did splendidly,\" she puffed. \"I\\'ve been crying like a\\nbaby, actually I have. There, they\\'re encoring you--they\\'re bound to\\nhave you back!\"\\n\"Oh, I can\\'t go,\" said Anne confusedly. \"But yet--I must, or Matthew\\nwill be disappointed. He said they would encore me.\"\\n\"Then don\\'t disappoint Matthew,\" said the pink lady, laughing.\\nSmiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint,\\nfunny little selection that captivated her audience still further. The\\nrest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.',\n",

The professional\\nelocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that\\nshe had a charming voice and \"interpreted\" her selections beautifully.\\nEven the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had\\nsupper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane\\nwere invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne,\\nbut Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear\\nof some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team,\\nhowever, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into\\nthe calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked\\ninto the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.\\nOh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night!\\nHow great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the\\nsea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants\\nguarding enchanted coasts.\\n\"Hasn\\'t it been a perfectly splendid time?\" sighed Jane, as they drove\\naway. \"I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at\\na hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and\\nchicken salad every blessed day. I\\'m sure it would be ever so much\\nmore fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great,\\nalthough I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it\\nwas better than Mrs. Evans\\'s.\"\\n\"Oh, no, don\\'t say things like that, Jane,\" said Anne quickly, \"because\\nit sounds silly. It couldn\\'t be better than Mrs. Evans\\'s, you know, for\\nshe is a professional, and I\\'m only a schoolgirl, with a little knack\\nof reciting. I\\'m quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty\\nwell.\"\\n\"I\\'ve a compliment for you, Anne,\" said Diana. \"At least I think it\\nmust be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it\\nwas anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a\\nromantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he\\nis a distinguished artist, and that her mother\\'s cousin in Boston is\\nmarried to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard\\nhim say--didn\\'t we, Jane?--\\'Who is that girl on the platform with the\\nsplendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.\\' There now,\\nAnne. But what does Titian hair mean?\"\\n\"Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,\" laughed Anne. \"Titian\\nwas a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.\"\\n\"_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?\" sighed Jane. \"They\\nwere simply dazzling. Wouldn\\'t you just love to be rich, girls?\"\\n\"We _are_ rich,\" said Anne staunchly. \"Why, we have sixteen years to our\\ncredit, and we\\'re happy as queens, and we\\'ve all got imaginations, more\\nor less. Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of\\nthings not seen. We couldn\\'t enjoy its loveliness any more if we had\\nmillions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldn\\'t change into any\\nof those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl\\nand wear a sour look all your life, as if you\\'d been born turning up\\nyour nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so\\nstout and short that you\\'d really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans,\\nwith that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully\\nunhappy sometime to have such a look. You _know_ you wouldn\\'t, Jane\\nAndrews!\"\\n\"I _don\\'t_ know--exactly,\" said Jane unconvinced. \"I think diamonds would\\ncomfort a person for a good deal.\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by\\ndiamonds all my life,\" declared Anne. \"I\\'m quite content to be Anne of\\nGreen Gables, with my string of pearl beads.

Anne\\'s outfit was\\nample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made\\nno objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested. More--one\\nevening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate\\npale green material.\\n\"Anne, here\\'s something for a nice light dress for you. I don\\'t suppose\\nyou really need it; you\\'ve plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe\\nyou\\'d like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere\\nof an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that\\nJane and Ruby and Josie have got \\'evening dresses,\\' as they call them,\\nand I don\\'t mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me\\npick it in town last week, and we\\'ll get Emily Gillis to make it for\\nyou. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren\\'t to be equaled.\"\\n\"Oh, Marilla, it\\'s just lovely,\" said Anne. \"Thank you so much. I don\\'t\\nbelieve you ought to be so kind to me--it\\'s making it harder every day\\nfor me to go away.\"\\nThe green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings\\nas Emily\\'s taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew\\'s\\nand Marilla\\'s benefit, and recited \"The Maiden\\'s Vow\" for them in the\\nkitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful\\nmotions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green\\nGables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child\\nin her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking\\nout of her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to\\nMarilla\\'s own eyes.\\n\"I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,\" said Anne gaily\\nstooping over Marilla\\'s chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady\\'s\\ncheek. \"Now, I call that a positive triumph.\"\\n\"No, I wasn\\'t crying over your piece,\" said Marilla, who would have\\nscorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. \"I just\\ncouldn\\'t help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. And\\nI was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your\\nqueer ways. You\\'ve grown up now and you\\'re going away; and you look so\\ntall and stylish and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if\\nyou didn\\'t belong in Avonlea at all--and I just got lonesome thinking it\\nall over.\"\\n\"Marilla!\" Anne sat down on Marilla\\'s gingham lap, took Marilla\\'s lined\\nface between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla\\'s\\neyes. \"I\\'m not a bit changed--not really. I\\'m only just pruned down and\\nbranched out. The real _me_--back here--is just the same. It won\\'t make a\\nbit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I\\nshall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear\\nGreen Gables more and better every day of her life.\"\\nAnne laid her fresh young cheek against Marilla\\'s faded one, and reached\\nout a hand to pat Matthew\\'s shoulder. Marilla would have given much just\\nthen to have possessed Anne\\'s power of putting her feelings into words;\\nbut nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her\\narms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing\\nthat she need never let her go.\\nMatthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went\\nout-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked\\nagitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.\\n\"Well now, I guess she ain\\'t been much spoiled,\" he muttered, proudly.\\n\"I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all.\\nShe\\'s smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the\\nrest. She\\'s been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake\\nthan what Mrs. Spencer made--if it _was_ luck. I don\\'t believe it was any\\nsuch thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her, I\\nreckon.\"',\n",

That first day passed pleasantly enough in a\\nwhirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the\\nprofessors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne\\nintended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss\\nStacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same.

Jane, Ruby,\\nJosie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the\\nstirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work.\\nAnne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in\\na room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the\\ntall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion\\nshe did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically.\\nYet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old\\nrivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what\\nto do if it had been lacking.\\n\"I wouldn\\'t feel comfortable without it,\" she thought. \"Gilbert looks\\nawfully determined.

I told him you were an orphan that\\nthe Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you\\'d\\nbeen before that.\"\\nAnne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more\\nsatisfactory than Josie Pye\\'s companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared,\\neach with an inch of Queen\\'s color ribbon--purple and scarlet--pinned\\nproudly to her coat. As Josie was not \"speaking\" to Jane just then she\\nhad to subside into comparative harmlessness.\\n\"Well,\" said Jane with a sigh, \"I feel as if I\\'d lived many moons since\\nthe morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old\\nprofessor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply\\ncouldn\\'t settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the\\ntraces of tears. If you\\'ve been crying _do_ own up. It will restore my\\nself-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I\\ndon\\'t mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too. Cake?\\nYou\\'ll give me a teeny piece, won\\'t you? Thank you. It has the real\\nAvonlea flavor.\"\\nRuby, perceiving the Queen\\'s calendar lying on the table, wanted to know\\nif Anne meant to try for the gold medal.\\nAnne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it.\\n\"Oh, that reminds me,\" said Josie, \"Queen\\'s is to get one of the Avery\\nscholarships after all. The word came today. Frank Stockley told me--his\\nuncle is one of the board of governors, you know. It will be announced\\nin the Academy tomorrow.\"',\n",

But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning\\nthe Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and\\ngraduating in a gown and mortar board, before the echo of Josie\\'s words\\nhad died away. For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt\\nthat here her foot was on native heath.\\nA wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his\\nfortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed\\namong the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces,\\naccording to their respective standings. There had been much doubt\\nwhether one would be allotted to Queen\\'s, but the matter was settled at\\nlast, and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark\\nin English and English Literature would win the scholarship--two hundred\\nand fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College. No wonder\\nthat Anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks!\\n\"I\\'ll win that scholarship if hard work can do it,\" she resolved.\\n\"Wouldn\\'t Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh, it\\'s delightful to\\nhave ambitions. I\\'m so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to\\nbe any end to them--that\\'s the best of it.

Ruby was a very handsome young lady, now thinking\\nherself quite as grown up as she really was; she wore her skirts as long\\nas her mother would let her and did her hair up in town, though she had\\nto take it down when she went home. She had large, bright-blue eyes,\\na brilliant complexion, and a plump showy figure. She laughed a great\\ndeal, was cheerful and good-tempered, and enjoyed the pleasant things of\\nlife frankly.\\n\"But I shouldn\\'t think she was the sort of girl Gilbert would like,\"\\nwhispered Jane to Anne. Anne did not think so either, but she would not\\nhave said so for the Avery scholarship. She could not help thinking,\\ntoo, that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as Gilbert\\nto jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and\\nambitions. Gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem\\nthe sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed.\\nThere was no silly sentiment in Anne\\'s ideas concerning Gilbert. Boys\\nwere to her, when she thought about them at all, merely possible good\\ncomrades. If she and Gilbert had been friends she would not have cared\\nhow many other friends he had nor with whom he walked. She had a genius\\nfor friendship; girl friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague\\nconsciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing\\nto round out one\\'s conceptions of companionship and furnish broader\\nstandpoints of judgment and comparison. Not that Anne could have put her\\nfeelings on the matter into just such clear definition. But she thought\\nthat if Gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train, over the\\ncrisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and\\nmerry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening\\naround them and their hopes and ambitions therein. Gilbert was a clever\\nyoung fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to\\nget the best out of life and put the best into it. Ruby Gillis told Jane\\nAndrews that she didn\\'t understand half the things Gilbert Blythe said;\\nhe talked just like Anne Shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on\\nand for her part she didn\\'t think it any fun to be bothering about books\\nand that sort of thing when you didn\\'t have to. Frank Stockley had lots\\nmore dash and go, but then he wasn\\'t half as good-looking as Gilbert and\\nshe really couldn\\'t decide which she liked best!',\n",

       "   'text': 'When it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up\\nthe idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there\\nwas a good deal of discussion over it. Most of the good folks, not\\nknowing about Marilla\\'s eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did\\nnot. She told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure\\nto the girl\\'s eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening\\nand found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,\\nscented summer dusk. They liked to sit there when the twilight came down\\nand the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled\\nthe dewy air.\\nMrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the\\ndoor, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a\\nlong breath of mingled weariness and relief.\\n\"I declare I\\'m getting glad to sit down. I\\'ve been on my feet all day,\\nand two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It\\'s\\na great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well,\\nAnne, I hear you\\'ve given up your notion of going to college. I was\\nreal glad to hear it. You\\'ve got as much education now as a woman can be\\ncomfortable with. I don\\'t believe in girls going to college with the men\\nand cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.\"\\n\"But I\\'m going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde,\" said\\nAnne laughing. \"I\\'m going to take my Arts course right here at Green\\nGables, and study everything that I would at college.\"\\nMrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.\\n\"Anne Shirley, you\\'ll kill yourself.\"\\n\"Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I\\'m not going to overdo\\nthings. As \\'Josiah Allen\\'s wife,\\' says, I shall be \\'mejum\\'. But I\\'ll\\nhave lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I\\'ve no\\nvocation for fancy work. I\\'m going to teach over at Carmody, you know.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know it. I guess you\\'re going to teach right here in Avonlea.\\nThe trustees have decided to give you the school.\"\\n\"Mrs. Lynde!\" cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. \"Why, I\\nthought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!\"\\n\"So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it\\nhe went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night,\\nyou know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested\\nthat they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of\\ncourse he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must\\nsay I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that\\'s what. Real\\nself-sacrificing, too, for he\\'ll have his board to pay at White Sands,\\nand everybody knows he\\'s got to earn his own way through college. So the\\ntrustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came\\nhome and told me.\"\\n\"I don\\'t feel that I ought to take it,\" murmured Anne. \"I mean--I don\\'t\\nthink I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me.\"\\n\"I guess you can\\'t prevent him now. He\\'s signed papers with the White\\nSands trustees. So it wouldn\\'t do him any good now if you were to',\n",

He lifted his cap courteously, but he would have passed\\non in silence, if Anne had not stopped and held out her hand.\\n\"Gilbert,\" she said, with scarlet cheeks, \"I want to thank you for\\ngiving up the school for me. It was very good of you--and I want you to\\nknow that I appreciate it.\"\\nGilbert took the offered hand eagerly.\\n\"It wasn\\'t particularly good of me at all, Anne. I was pleased to be\\nable to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after\\nthis? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?\"\\nAnne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.\\n\"I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn\\'t know\\nit. What a stubborn little goose I was. I\\'ve been--I may as well make a\\ncomplete confession--I\\'ve been sorry ever since.\"\\n\"We are going to be the best of friends,\" said Gilbert, jubilantly. \"We\\nwere born to be good friends, Anne. You\\'ve thwarted destiny enough. I\\nknow we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your\\nstudies, aren\\'t you? So am I. Come, I\\'m going to walk home with you.\"\\nMarilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.\\n\"Who was that came up the lane with you, Anne?\"\\n\"Gilbert Blythe,\" answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing. \"I met\\nhim on Barry\\'s hill.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you\\'d\\nstand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,\" said Marilla with a\\ndry smile.\\n\"We haven\\'t been--we\\'ve been good enemies. But we have decided that it\\nwill be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. Were we\\nreally there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see,\\nwe have five years\\' lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla.\"\\nAnne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content.\\nThe wind purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came\\nup to her. The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and\\nDiana\\'s light gleamed through the old gap.\\nAnne\\'s horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after\\ncoming home from Queen\\'s; but if the path set before her feet was to be\\nnarrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it.\\nThe joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship\\nwere to be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her\\nideal world of dreams.
