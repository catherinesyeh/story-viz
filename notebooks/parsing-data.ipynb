       "'LINE 1: Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\nLINE 2: bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\\nLINE 3: the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\nLINE 4: conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice\\nLINE 5: \"without pictures or conversations?\"\\nLINE 6: So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nLINE 7: hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\\nLINE 8: making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\nLINE 9: picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nLINE 10: close by her.\\nLINE 11: There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\\nLINE 12: so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \"Oh\\nLINE 13: dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\" (when she thought it over afterwards,\\nLINE 14: it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\nLINE 15: time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\nLINE 16: watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\nLINE 17: on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\nLINE 18: had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\nLINE 19: watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\nLINE 20: field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\nLINE 21: large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\nLINE 22: In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nLINE 23: in the world she was to get out again.\\nLINE 24: The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\nLINE 25: dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nLINE 26: about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\nLINE 27: deep well.\\nLINE 28: Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nLINE 29: plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\nLINE 30: was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\\nLINE 31: what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nLINE 32: looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\nLINE 33: cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nLINE 34: hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\nLINE 35: passed; it was labelled \"ORANGE MARMALADE\", but to her great\\nLINE 36: disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nLINE 37: of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\nLINE 38: cupboards as she fell past it.\\nLINE 39: \"Well!\" thought Alice to herself, \"after such a fall as this, I shall\\nLINE 40: think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\\'ll all think me\\nLINE 41: at home! Why, I wouldn\\'t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\nLINE 42: top of the house!\" (Which was very likely true.)\\nLINE 43: Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \"I wonder how\\nLINE 44: many miles I\\'ve fallen by this time?\" she said aloud. \"I must be\\nLINE 45: getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\\nLINE 46: be four thousand miles down, I think—\" (for, you see, Alice had learnt\\nLINE 47: several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\nLINE 48: though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\\nLINE 49: knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\nLINE 50: practice to say it over) \"—yes, that\\'s about the right distance—but\\nLINE 51: then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\\'ve got to?\" (Alice had no\\nLINE 52: idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\nLINE 53: grand words to say.)\\nLINE 54: Presently she began again. \"I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\\nLINE 55: the earth! How funny it\\'ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\nLINE 56: with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—\" (she was rather\\nLINE 57: glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn\\'t sound at all\\nLINE 58: the right word) \"—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\nLINE 59: country is, you know. Please, Ma\\'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\"\\nLINE 60: (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you\\'re\\nLINE 61: falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \"And what\\nLINE 62: an ignorant little girl she\\'ll think me for asking! No, it\\'ll never do\\nLINE 63: to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\"\\nLINE 64: Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\nLINE 65: talking again. \"Dinah\\'ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\"\\nLINE 66: (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they\\'ll remember her saucer of milk at\\nLINE 67: tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\\nLINE 68: no mice in the air, I\\'m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\\'s\\nLINE 69: very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\" And here\\nLINE 70: Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\nLINE 71: dreamy sort of way, \"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\" and\\nLINE 72: sometimes, \"Do bats eat cats?\" for, you see, as she couldn\\'t answer\\nLINE 73: either question, it didn\\'t much matter which way she put it. She felt\\nLINE 74: that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\nLINE 75: walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\nLINE 76: \"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly,\\nLINE 77: thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\nLINE 78: the fall was over.\\nLINE 79: Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\nLINE 80: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\nLINE 81: long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\\nLINE 82: it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\\nLINE 83: and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh my ears\\nLINE 84: and whiskers, how late it\\'s getting!\" She was close behind it when she\\nLINE 85: turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nLINE 86: herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nLINE 87: from the roof.\\nLINE 88: There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nLINE 89: Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\nLINE 90: door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nLINE 91: get out again.\\nLINE 92: Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nLINE 93: glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\\'s\\nLINE 94: first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nLINE 95: but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nLINE 96: but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\nLINE 97: time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\nLINE 98: behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\nLINE 99: little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\nLINE 100: Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nLINE 101: much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\\nLINE 102: passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\\nLINE 103: out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\nLINE 104: flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\nLINE 105: through the doorway; \"and even if my head would go through,\" thought\\nLINE 106: poor Alice, \"it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\\nLINE 107: how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\\nLINE 108: knew how to begin.\" For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\\nLINE 109: happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\\nLINE 110: indeed were really impossible.\\nLINE 111: There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\nLINE 112: back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\nLINE 113: any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\nLINE 114: time she found a little bottle on it, (\"which certainly was not here\\nLINE 115: before,\" said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\nLINE 116: label, with the words \"DRINK ME,\" beautifully printed on it in large\\nLINE 117: letters.\\nLINE 118: It was all very well to say \"Drink me,\" but the wise little Alice was\\nLINE 119: not going to do _that_ in a hurry. \"No, I\\'ll look first,\" she said,\\nLINE 120: \"and see whether it\\'s marked \\'_poison_\\' or not\"; for she had read\\nLINE 121: several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\\nLINE 122: eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\\nLINE 123: _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\\nLINE 124: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\\nLINE 125: and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\\nLINE 126: bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\\nLINE 127: bottle marked \"poison,\" it is almost certain to disagree with you,\\nLINE 128: sooner or later.\\nLINE 129: However, this bottle was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured to\\nLINE 130: taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\\nLINE 131: flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\\nLINE 132: hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\nLINE 133: * * * * * * *\\nLINE 134: * * * * * *\\nLINE 135: * * * * * * *\\nLINE 136: \"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice; \"I must be shutting up like a\\nLINE 137: telescope.\"\\nLINE 138: And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\nLINE 139: brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nLINE 140: through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\\nLINE 141: waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\nLINE 142: she felt a little nervous about this; \"for it might end, you know,\"\\nLINE 143: said Alice to herself, \"in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\\nLINE 144: wonder what I should be like then?\" And she tried to fancy what the\\nLINE 145: flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\\nLINE 146: not remember ever having seen such a thing.\\nLINE 147: After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\nLINE 148: into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\\nLINE 149: door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\nLINE 150: went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\nLINE 151: it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\nLINE 152: best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\nLINE 153: and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\nLINE 154: sat down and cried.\\nLINE 155: \"Come, there\\'s no use in crying like that!\" said Alice to herself,\\nLINE 156: rather sharply; \"I advise you to leave off this minute!\" She generally\\nLINE 157: gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\nLINE 158: and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\nLINE 159: her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\nLINE 160: cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\nLINE 161: for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\nLINE 162: \"But it\\'s no use now,\" thought poor Alice, \"to pretend to be two\\nLINE 163: people! Why, there\\'s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\\nLINE 164: person!\"\\nLINE 165: Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\nLINE 166: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\nLINE 167: \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, I\\'ll eat it,\" said\\nLINE 168: Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\nLINE 169: makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\\'ll\\nLINE 170: get into the garden, and I don\\'t care which happens!\"\\nLINE 171: She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which\\nLINE 172: way?\", holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\nLINE 173: growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nLINE 174: size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\nLINE 175: had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\nLINE 176: things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\\nLINE 177: on in the common way.\\nLINE 178: So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\nLINE 179: * * * * * * *\\nLINE 180: * * * * * *\\nLINE 181: * * * * * * *'"

       "   'text': 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\ndeep well.\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\npassed; it was labelled \"ORANGE MARMALADE\", but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\ncupboards as she fell past it.\\n\"Well!\" thought Alice to herself, \"after such a fall as this, I shall\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\\'ll all think me\\nat home! Why, I wouldn\\'t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\ntop of the house!\" (Which was very likely true.)\\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \"I wonder how\\nmany miles I\\'ve fallen by this time?\" she said aloud. \"I must be\\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—\" (for, you see, Alice had learnt\\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\npractice to say it over) \"—yes, that\\'s about the right distance—but\\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\\'ve got to?\" (Alice had no\\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\ngrand words to say.)\\nPresently she began again. \"I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\\nthe earth! How funny it\\'ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—\" (she was rather\\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn\\'t sound at all\\nthe right word) \"—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma\\'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\"\\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you\\'re\\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \"And what\\nan ignorant little girl she\\'ll think me for asking! No, it\\'ll never do\\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\"\\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\ntalking again. \"Dinah\\'ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\"\\n(Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they\\'ll remember her saucer of milk at\\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\\nno mice in the air, I\\'m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\\'s\\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\" And here\\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\ndreamy sort of way, \"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\" and\\nsometimes, \"Do bats eat cats?\" for, you see, as she couldn\\'t answer\\neither question, it didn\\'t much matter which way she put it. She felt\\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\n\"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly,\\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\nthe fall was over.',\n",

There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh my ears\\nand whiskers, how late it\\'s getting!\" She was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof.\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again.\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\\'s\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\nthrough the doorway; \"and even if my head would go through,\" thought\\npoor Alice, \"it would be of very little use without my shoulders.

This time there were\\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \"What a number\\nof cucumber-frames there must be!\" thought Alice. \"I wonder what\\nthey\\'ll do next!

And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\\'t see you?\"\\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.

No, no! You\\'re a serpent; and there\\'s\\nno use denying it. I suppose you\\'ll be telling me next that you never\\ntasted an egg!\"\\n\"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\" said Alice, who was a very truthful\\nchild; \"but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\nknow.\"\\n\"I don\\'t believe it,\" said the Pigeon; \"but if they do, why then\\nthey\\'re a kind of serpent, that\\'s all I can say.\"\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \"You\\'re\\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\\nme whether you\\'re a little girl or a serpent?\"\\n\"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I\\'m not\\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\\'t want\\n_yours_: I don\\'t like them raw.\"\\n\"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.

You grant that?\"\\n\"I suppose so,\" said Alice.\\n\"Well, then,\" the Cat went on, \"you see, a dog growls when it\\'s angry,\\nand wags its tail when it\\'s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I\\'m pleased,\\nand wag my tail when I\\'m angry. Therefore I\\'m mad.\"\\n\"_I_ call it purring, not growling,\" said Alice.\\n\"Call it what you like,\" said the Cat. \"Do you play croquet with the\\nQueen to-day?\"\\n\"I should like it very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven\\'t been invited\\nyet.\"\\n\"You\\'ll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished.',\n",

       "   'text': 'A Mad Tea-Party\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \"Very\\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\" thought Alice; \"only, as it\\'s asleep,\\nI suppose it doesn\\'t mind.\"\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it: \"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw\\nAlice coming. \"There\\'s _plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and\\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\"Have some wine,\" the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\n\"I don\\'t see any wine,\" she remarked.\\n\"There isn\\'t any,\" said the March Hare.\\n\"Then it wasn\\'t very civil of you to offer it,\" said Alice angrily.\\n\"It wasn\\'t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\" said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\"I didn\\'t know it was _your_ table,\" said Alice; \"it\\'s laid for a great\\nmany more than three.\"\\n\"Your hair wants cutting,\" said the Hatter. He had been looking at\\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\\nspeech.\\n\"You should learn not to make personal remarks,\" Alice said with some\\nseverity; \"it\\'s very rude.\"\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\\nwas, \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"\\n\"Come, we shall have some fun now!\" thought Alice. \"I\\'m glad they\\'ve\\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,\" she added aloud.\\n\"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\"Exactly so,\" said Alice.\\n\"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.\\n\"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least—at least I mean what I\\nsay—that\\'s the same thing, you know.\"\\n\"Not the same thing a bit!\" said the Hatter. \"You might just as well\\nsay that \\'I see what I eat\\' is the same thing as \\'I eat what I see\\'!\"\\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the March Hare, \"that \\'I like what\\nI get\\' is the same thing as \\'I get what I like\\'!\"\\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\ntalking in his sleep, \"that \\'I breathe when I sleep\\' is the same thing\\nas \\'I sleep when I breathe\\'!\"\\n\"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and here the\\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\\nwriting-desks, which wasn\\'t much.\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \"What day of the month\\nis it?\" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\nand holding it to his ear.\\nAlice considered a little, and then said \"The fourth.\"\\n\"Two days wrong!\" sighed the Hatter. \"I told you butter wouldn\\'t suit\\nthe works!\" he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\n\"It was the _best_ butter,\" the March Hare meekly replied.\\n\"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\" the Hatter grumbled:\\n\"you shouldn\\'t have put it in with the bread-knife.\"\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \"It was the _best_ butter,\\nyou know.\"\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \"What a\\nfunny watch!\" she remarked. \"It tells the day of the month, and doesn\\'t\\ntell what o\\'clock it is!\"\\n\"Why should it?\" muttered the Hatter. \"Does _your_ watch tell you what\\nyear it is?\"\\n\"Of course not,\" Alice replied very readily: \"but that\\'s because it\\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\"\\n\"Which is just the case with _mine_,\" said the Hatter.\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\\'s remark seemed to have no\\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \"I don\\'t quite\\nunderstand you,\" she said, as politely as she could.\\n\"The Dormouse is asleep again,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\nhot tea upon its nose.\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\neyes, \"Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\"\\n\"Have you guessed the riddle yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\nagain.\\n\"No, I give it up,\" Alice replied: \"what\\'s the answer?\"\\n\"I haven\\'t the slightest idea,\" said the Hatter.\\n\"Nor I,\" said the March Hare.\\nAlice sighed wearily. \"I think you might do something better with the\\ntime,\" she said, \"than waste it in asking riddles that have no\\nanswers.\"\\n\"If you knew Time as well as I do,\" said the Hatter, \"you wouldn\\'t talk\\nabout wasting _it_. It\\'s _him_.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean,\" said Alice.\\n\"Of course you don\\'t!\" the Hatter said, tossing his head\\ncontemptuously. \"I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\"\\n\"Perhaps not,\" Alice cautiously replied: \"but I know I have to beat\\ntime when I learn music.\"\\n\"Ah! that accounts for it,\" said the Hatter. \"He won\\'t stand beating.\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\\'d do almost anything\\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\\'clock in\\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you\\'d only have to whisper a\\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\\ntime for dinner!\"\\n(\"I only wish it was,\" the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\\n\"That would be grand, certainly,\" said Alice thoughtfully: \"but then—I\\nshouldn\\'t be hungry for it, you know.\"\\n\"Not at first, perhaps,\" said the Hatter: \"but you could keep it to\\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.\"\\n\"Is that the way _you_ manage?\" Alice asked.\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \"Not I!\" he replied. \"We\\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—\" (pointing\\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \"—it was at the great concert\\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\n\\'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\nHow I wonder what you\\'re at!\\'\\nYou know the song, perhaps?\"\\n\"I\\'ve heard something like it,\" said Alice.\\n\"It goes on, you know,\" the Hatter continued, \"in this way:—\\n\\'Up above the world you fly,\\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\\nTwinkle, twinkle—\\'\"\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\\n\"_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—\" and went on so long that they\\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\\n\"Well, I\\'d hardly finished the first verse,\" said the Hatter, \"when the\\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, \\'He\\'s murdering the time! Off with his\\nhead!\\'\"\\n\"How dreadfully savage!\" exclaimed Alice.\\n\"And ever since that,\" the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \"he won\\'t\\ndo a thing I ask! It\\'s always six o\\'clock now.\"\\nA bright idea came into Alice\\'s head. \"Is that the reason so many\\ntea-things are put out here?\" she asked.\\n\"Yes, that\\'s it,\" said the Hatter with a sigh: \"it\\'s always tea-time,\\nand we\\'ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\"\\n\"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\" said Alice.\\n\"Exactly so,\" said the Hatter: \"as the things get used up.\"\\n\"But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\" Alice ventured\\nto ask.\\n\"Suppose we change the subject,\" the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\n\"I\\'m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t know one,\" said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\nproposal.\\n\"Then the Dormouse shall!\" they both cried. \"Wake up, Dormouse!\" And\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \"I wasn\\'t asleep,\" he said in a\\nhoarse, feeble voice: \"I heard every word you fellows were saying.\"\\n\"Tell us a story!\" said the March Hare.\\n\"Yes, please do!\" pleaded Alice.\\n\"And be quick about it,\" added the Hatter, \"or you\\'ll be asleep again\\nbefore it\\'s done.\"\\n\"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\" the Dormouse began\\nin a great hurry; \"and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—\"\\n\"What did they live on?\" said Alice, who always took a great interest\\nin questions of eating and drinking.\\n\"They lived on treacle,\" said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\"They couldn\\'t have done that, you know,\" Alice gently remarked;\\n\"they\\'d have been ill.\"\\n\"So they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"_very_ ill.\"\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \"But\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\\n\"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\"I\\'ve had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can\\'t\\ntake more.\"\\n\"You mean you can\\'t take _less_,\" said the Hatter: \"it\\'s very easy to\\ntake _more_ than nothing.\"\\n\"Nobody asked _your_ opinion,\" said Alice.\\n\"Who\\'s making personal remarks now?\" the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\nrepeated her question. \"Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\nsaid, \"It was a treacle-well.\"\\n\"There\\'s no such thing!\" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\nHatter and the March Hare went \"Sh! sh!\" and the Dormouse sulkily\\nremarked, \"If you can\\'t be civil, you\\'d better finish the story for\\nyourself.\"\\n\"No, please go on!\" Alice said very humbly; \"I won\\'t interrupt again. I\\ndare say there may be _one_.\"\\n\"One, indeed!\" said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\ngo on. \"And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\\nyou know—\"\\n\"What did they draw?\" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\n\"Treacle,\" said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\n\"I want a clean cup,\" interrupted the Hatter: \"let\\'s all move one place\\non.\"\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\\nmoved into the Dormouse\\'s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\ncautiously: \"But I don\\'t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\nfrom?\"\\n\"You can draw water out of a water-well,\" said the Hatter; \"so I should\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?\"\\n\"But they were _in_ the well,\" Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\\nto notice this last remark.\\n\"Of course they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"—well in.\"\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\nsome time without interrupting it.\\n\"They were learning to draw,\" the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \"and they drew all manner of\\nthings—everything that begins with an M—\"\\n\"Why with an M?\" said Alice.\\n\"Why not?\" said the March Hare.\\nAlice was silent.\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\\nlittle shriek, and went on: \"—that begins with an M, such as\\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\\nthings are \"much of a muchness\"—did you ever see such a thing as a\\ndrawing of a muchness?\"\\n\"Really, now you ask me,\" said Alice, very much confused, \"I don\\'t\\nthink—\"\\n\"Then you shouldn\\'t talk,\" said the Hatter.\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\nthe teapot.',\n",
