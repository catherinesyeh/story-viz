LINE 1: What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?
LINE 2: Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they
LINE 3: followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and
LINE 4: Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,
LINE 5: Gardiner's place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of
LINE 6: Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt,
LINE 7: bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.
LINE 8: Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the
LINE 9: circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle
LINE 10: being less than the arc which it subtends.
LINE 11: Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?
LINE 12: Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
LINE 13: prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and
LINE 14: glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed
LINE 15: corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,
LINE 16: ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,
LINE 17: the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the
LINE 18: presabbath, Stephen's collapse.
LINE 19: Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their
LINE 20: respective like and unlike reactions to experience?
LINE 21: Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
LINE 22: plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner
LINE 23: of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both
LINE 24: indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
LINE 25: heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
LINE 26: religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the
LINE 27: alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
LINE 28: magnetism.
LINE 29: Were their views on some points divergent?
LINE 30: Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's views on the importance of
LINE 31: dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's
LINE 32: views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.
LINE 33: Bloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism
LINE 34: involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to
LINE 35: christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,
LINE 36: son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign
LINE 37: of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt
LINE 38: († 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty
LINE 39: and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric
LINE 40: inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
LINE 41: adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
LINE 42: the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
LINE 43: attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
LINE 44: from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first
LINE 45: no bigger than a woman's hand.
LINE 46: Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?
LINE 47: The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining
LINE 48: paraheliotropic trees.
LINE 49: Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in
LINE 50: the past?
LINE 51: In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
LINE 52: thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and
LINE 53: Leonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield
LINE 54: avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the
LINE 55: wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of
LINE 56: Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and
LINE 57: prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class
LINE 58: railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major
LINE 59: Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and
LINE 60: separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once
LINE 61: in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both
LINE 62: occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street,
LINE 63: west.
LINE 64: What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,
LINE 65: 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at
LINE 66: their destination?
LINE 67: He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
LINE 68: development and experience was regressively accompanied by a
LINE 69: restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.
LINE 70: As in what ways?
LINE 71: From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
LINE 72: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from
LINE 73: existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.
LINE 74: What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?
LINE 75: At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers,
LINE 76: number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back
LINE 77: pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.
LINE 78: Was it there?
LINE 79: It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on
LINE 80: the day but one preceding.
LINE 81: Why was he doubly irritated?
LINE 82: Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
LINE 83: himself twice not to forget.
LINE 84: What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly
LINE 85: (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?
LINE 86: To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.
LINE 87: Bloom's decision?
LINE 88: A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
LINE 89: area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
LINE 90: the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
LINE 91: length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten
LINE 92: inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in
LINE 93: space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in
LINE 94: preparation for the impact of the fall.
LINE 95: Did he fall?
LINE 96: By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in
LINE 97: avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for
LINE 98: periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,
LINE 99: pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast
LINE 100: of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year
LINE 101: one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era
LINE 102: five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand
LINE 103: three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,
LINE 104: dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.
LINE 105: Did he rise uninjured by concussion?
LINE 106: Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
LINE 107: the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force
LINE 108: at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied
LINE 109: at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the
LINE 110: subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free
LINE 111: inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame
LINE 112: which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit
LINE 113: finally a portable candle.
LINE 114: What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?
LINE 115: Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
LINE 116: kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a
LINE 117: candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man
LINE 118: leaving the kitchen holding a candle.
LINE 119: Did the man reappear elsewhere?
LINE 120: After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
LINE 121: through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the
LINE 122: halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open
LINE 123: space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his
LINE 124: candle.
LINE 125: Did Stephen obey his sign?
LINE 126: Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and
LINE 127: followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and
LINE 128: lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and
LINE 129: carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the
LINE 130: kitchen of Bloom's house.
LINE 131: What did Bloom do?
LINE 132: He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its
LINE 133: flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for
LINE 134: Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when
LINE 135: necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid
LINE 136: resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons
LINE 137: of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs
LINE 138: Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three
LINE 139: projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby
LINE 140: releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its
LINE 141: carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen
LINE 142: of the air.
LINE 143: Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?
LINE 144: Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,
LINE 145: had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the
LINE 146: college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the
LINE 147: county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room
LINE 148: of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of
LINE 149: his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss
LINE 150: Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie
LINE 151: (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil
LINE 152: street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of
LINE 153: number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of
LINE 154: Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the
LINE 155: physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's Green, north: of
LINE 156: his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.
LINE 157: What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from
LINE 158: the fire towards the opposite wall?
LINE 159: Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,
LINE 160: stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the
LINE 161: chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs
LINE 162: folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of
LINE 163: ladies' grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual
LINE 164: position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer
LINE 165: extremities and the third at their point of junction.
LINE 166: What did Bloom see on the range?
LINE 167: On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left
LINE 168: (larger) hob a black iron kettle.
LINE 169: What did Bloom do at the range?
LINE 170: He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron
LINE 171: kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to
LINE 172: let it flow.
LINE 173: Did it flow?
LINE 174: Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of
LINE 175: 2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of
LINE 176: filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial
LINE 177: plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen
LINE 178: of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a
LINE 179: distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving
LINE 180: tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace
LINE 181: bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and
LINE 182: daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the
LINE 183: sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and
LINE 184: waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of
LINE 185: the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for
LINE 186: purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of
LINE 187: recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals
LINE 188: as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding
LINE 189: their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch
LINE 190: meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a
LINE 191: reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the
LINE 192: corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the
LINE 193: detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,
LINE 194: solvent, sound.
LINE 195: What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
LINE 196: returning to the range, admire?
LINE 197: Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
LINE 198: in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's
LINE 199: projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the
LINE 200: Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
LINE 201: surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
LINE 202: independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
LINE 203: hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
LINE 204: spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
LINE 205: circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
LINE 206: significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
LINE 207: globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
LINE 208: the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the
LINE 209: multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
LINE 210: capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
LINE 211: including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
LINE 212: erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
LINE 213: homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
LINE 214: alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
LINE 215: imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
LINE 216: colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
LINE 217: ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
LINE 218: oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
LINE 219: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
LINE 220: seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
LINE 221: freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
LINE 222: cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
LINE 223: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
LINE 224: and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
LINE 225: instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
LINE 226: Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
LINE 227: its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
LINE 228: part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
LINE 229: Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
LINE 230: inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
LINE 231: quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
LINE 232: paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
LINE 233: sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
LINE 234: in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
LINE 235: and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
LINE 236: and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
LINE 237: docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
LINE 238: power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
LINE 239: canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
LINE 240: potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
LINE 241: from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic,
LINE 242: photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
LINE 243: globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
LINE 244: % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine
LINE 245: % marshes,
LINE 246: pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning
LINE 247: moon.
LINE 248: Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he
LINE 249: return to the stillflowing tap?
LINE 250: To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of
LINE 251: Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought
LINE 252: thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh
LINE 253: cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in
LINE 254: a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.
LINE 255: What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?
LINE 256: That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
LINE 257: submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the
LINE 258: month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous
LINE 259: substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and
LINE 260: language.
LINE 261: What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
LINE 262: prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a
LINE 263: preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with
LINE 264: rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region
LINE 265: in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most
LINE 266: sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?
LINE 267: The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.
LINE 268: What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?
LINE 269: Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric
LINE 270: energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the
LINE 271: lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.
LINE 272: Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?
LINE 273: Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
LINE 274: recuperation.
LINE 275: What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
LINE 276: agency of fire?
LINE 277: The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of
LINE 278: ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was
LINE 279: communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral
LINE 280: masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the
LINE 281: foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn
LINE 282: derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat
LINE 283: (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous
LINE 284: ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion,
LINE 285: was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of
LINE 286: calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated
LINE 287: through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part
LINE 288: reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the
LINE 289: temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in
LINE 290: temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal
LINE 291: units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.
LINE 292: What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?
LINE 293: A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
LINE 294: both sides simultaneously.
LINE 295: For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?
LINE 296: To shave himself.
LINE 297: What advantages attended shaving by night?
LINE 298: A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
LINE 299: shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if
LINE 300: unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at
LINE 301: incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a
LINE 302: cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal
LINE 303: noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a
LINE 304: postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering,
LINE 305: relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he
LINE 306: sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving
LINE 307: and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected
LINE 308: and applied adhered: which was to be done.
LINE 309: Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?
LINE 310: Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine
LINE 311: feminine passive active hand.
LINE 312: What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting
LINE 313: influence?
LINE 314: The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human
LINE 315: blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their
LINE 316: natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic
LINE 317: surgery.
LINE 318: What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the
LINE 319: kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?
LINE 320: On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal
LINE 321: breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a
LINE 322: moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white
LINE 323: goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly
LINE 324: copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. On the middle shelf a
LINE 325: chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four
LINE 326: conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of
LINE 327: Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and
LINE 328: containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and
LINE 329: Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink
LINE 330: tissue paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne
LINE 331: Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a
LINE 332: cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two
LINE 333: onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish,
LINE 334: bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model
LINE 335: Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a
LINE 336: quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water,
LINE 337: acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity
LINE 338: subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts, made one
LINE 339: imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a
LINE 340: halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the
LINE 341: upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and
LINE 342: proveniences.
LINE 343: What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?
LINE 344: Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,
LINE 345: numbered 8 87, 88 6.
LINE 346: What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?
LINE 347: Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,
LINE 348: preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official
LINE 349: and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_,
LINE 350: late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.
LINE 351: Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,
LINE 352: been received by him?
LINE 353: In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain
LINE 354: street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in
LINE 355: O'Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had
LINE 356: placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising
LINE 357: Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the
LINE 358: premises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when,
LINE 359: when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively
LINE 360: requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the
LINE 361: _Freeman's Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to
LINE 362: throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the
LINE 363: oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street,
LINE 364: with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in
LINE 365: his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.
LINE 366: What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?
LINE 367: The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
LINE 368: followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
LINE 369: electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by
LINE 370: failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding
LINE 371: originally from a successful interpretation.
LINE 372: His mood?
LINE 373: He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he
LINE 374: was satisfied.
LINE 375: What satisfied him?
LINE 376: To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to
LINE 377: others. Light to the gentiles.
LINE 378: How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?
LINE 379: He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's
LINE 380: soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed
LINE 381: on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the
LINE 382: prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity
LINE 383: prescribed.
LINE 384: What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
LINE 385: guest?
LINE 386: Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
LINE 387: Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly),
LINE 388: he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served
LINE 389: extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the
LINE 390: viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion
LINE 391: (Molly).
LINE 392: Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
LINE 393: hospitality?
LINE 394: His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he
LINE 395: accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's
LINE 396: massproduct, the creature cocoa.
LINE 397: Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
LINE 398: reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to
LINE 399: complete the act begun?
LINE 400: The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right
LINE 401: side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four
LINE 402: lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable
LINE 403: condition.
LINE 404: Who drank more quickly?
LINE 405: Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and
LINE 406: taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a
LINE 407: steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one,
LINE 408: six to two, nine to three.
LINE 409: What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?
LINE 410: Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
LINE 411: engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived
LINE 412: from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself
LINE 413: had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the
LINE 414: solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.
LINE 415: Had he found their solution?
LINE 416: In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
LINE 417: aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,
LINE 418: the answers not bearing in all points.
LINE 419: What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,
LINE 420: potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the
LINE 421: offering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for
LINE 422: competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?
LINE 423: An ambition to squint
LINE 424: At my verses in print
LINE 425: Makes me hope that for these you'll find room.
LINE 426: If you so condescend
LINE 427: Then please place at the end
LINE 428: The name of yours truly, L. Bloom.
LINE 429: Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?
LINE 430: Name, age, race, creed.
LINE 431: What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?
LINE 432: Leopold Bloom
LINE 433: Ellpodbomool
LINE 434: Molldopeloob
LINE 435: Bollopedoom
LINE 436: Old Ollebo, M. P.
LINE 437: What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic
LINE 438: poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?
LINE 439: Poets oft have sung in rhyme
LINE 440: Of music sweet their praise divine.
LINE 441: Let them hymn it nine times nine.
LINE 442: Dearer far than song or wine.
LINE 443: You are mine. The world is mine.
LINE 444: What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.
LINE 445: Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,
LINE 446: entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_,
LINE 447: commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,
LINE 448: 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the
LINE 449: valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the
LINE 450: grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.
LINE 451: Shelton 26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by
LINE 452: George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan
LINE 453: under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie
LINE 454: Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist,
LINE 455: principal girl?
LINE 456: Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,
LINE 457: the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded
LINE 458: 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
LINE 459: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
LINE 460: questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke
LINE 461: and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru
LINE 462: (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
LINE 463: professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand
LINE 464: Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street:
LINE 465: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's
LINE 466: non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
LINE 467: and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white
LINE 468: articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing
LINE 469: while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the
LINE 470: difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous
LINE 471: allusions from _Everybody's Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in
LINE 472: every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous,
LINE 473: associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new
LINE 474: high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket
LINE 475: Barton.
LINE 476: What relation existed between their ages?
LINE 477: 16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen
LINE 478: was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present
LINE 479: age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54
LINE 480: their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
LINE 481: 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
LINE 482: as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
LINE 483: 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
LINE 484: 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen
LINE 485: would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
LINE 486: Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,
LINE 487: being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
LINE 488: surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of
LINE 489: Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until
LINE 490: he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been
LINE 491: obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have
LINE 492: been born in the year 81,396 B.C.
LINE 493: What events might nullify these calculations?
LINE 494: The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new
LINE 495: era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent
LINE 496: extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.
LINE 497: How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?
LINE 498: Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina
LINE 499: Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's
LINE 500: mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his
LINE 501: hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on
LINE 502: a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's
LINE 503: father and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.
LINE 504: Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and
LINE 505: afterwards seconded by the father?
LINE 506: Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
LINE 507: gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.
LINE 508: Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a
LINE 509: third connecting link between them?
LINE 510: Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the
LINE 511: house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891
LINE 512: and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City
LINE 513: Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during
LINE 514: parts of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of
LINE 515: Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in
LINE 516: the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence
LINE 517: of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular
LINE 518: road.
LINE 519: Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?
LINE 520: He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
LINE 521: of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with
LINE 522: slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North
LINE 523: Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had
LINE 524: remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular
LINE 525: fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles
LINE 526: equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,
LINE 527: private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from
LINE 528: the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.
LINE 529: Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?
LINE 530: Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of
LINE 531: bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with
LINE 532: continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,
LINE 533: velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round
LINE 534: and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.
LINE 535: What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years
LINE 536: deceased?
LINE 537: The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
LINE 538: suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient
LINE 539: catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the
LINE 540: statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for
LINE 541: Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.
LINE 542: Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation
LINE 543: which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the
LINE 544: more desirable?
LINE 545: The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
LINE 546: abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's _Physical Strength and How to
LINE 547: Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
LINE 548: sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in
LINE 549: front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of
LINE 550: muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant
LINE 551: relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.
LINE 552: Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?
LINE 553: Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full
LINE 554: circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had
LINE 555: excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever
LINE 556: movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally
LINE 557: developed abdominal muscles.
LINE 558: Did either openly allude to their racial difference?
LINE 559: Neither.
LINE 560: What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts
LINE 561: about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen's thoughts about
LINE 562: Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?
LINE 563: He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he
LINE 564: knew that he knew that he was not.
LINE 565: What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective
LINE 566: parentages?
LINE 567: Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag
LINE 568: (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan,
LINE 569: London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius
LINE 570: Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest
LINE 571: surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin
LINE 572: and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).
LINE 573: Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or
LINE 574: layman?
LINE 575: Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone,
LINE 576: in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James
LINE 577: O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump
LINE 578: in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in
LINE 579: the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the
LINE 580: reverend Charles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three
LINE 581: Patrons, Rathgar.
LINE 582: Did they find their educational careers similar?
LINE 583: Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively
LINE 584: through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for
LINE 585: Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,
LINE 586: junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the
LINE 587: matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the
LINE 588: royal university.
LINE 589: Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the
LINE 590: university of life?
LINE 591: Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation
LINE 592: had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to
LINE 593: him.
LINE 594: What two temperaments did they individually represent?
LINE 595: The scientific. The artistic.
LINE 596: What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards
LINE 597: applied, rather than towards pure, science?
LINE 598: Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in
LINE 599: a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his
LINE 600: appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once
LINE 601: revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting
LINE 602: telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water
LINE 603: siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.
LINE 604: Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of
LINE 605: kindergarten?
LINE 606: Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
LINE 607: catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the
LINE 608: twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature
LINE 609: mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to
LINE 610: correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls,
LINE 611: historically costumed dolls.
LINE 612: What also stimulated him in his cogitations?
LINE 613: The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,
LINE 614: the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George's street, south, the latter at
LINE 615: his 6 1/2d shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30
LINE 616: Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities
LINE 617: hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in
LINE 618: triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility
LINE 619: (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of
LINE 620: magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to
LINE 621: convince, to decide.
LINE 622: Such as?
LINE 623: K. 11. Kino's 11/— Trousers.
LINE 624: House of Keys. Alexander J. Keyes.
LINE 625: Such as not?
LINE 626: Look at this long candle. Calculate when it burns out and you receive
LINE 627: gratis 1 pair of our special non-compo boots, guaranteed 1 candle
LINE 628: power. Address: Barclay and Cook, 18 Talbot street.
LINE 629: Bacilikil (Insect Powder).
LINE 630: Veribest (Boot Blacking).
LINE 631: Uwantit (Combined pocket twoblade penknife with corkscrew, nailfile and
LINE 632: pipecleaner).
LINE 633: Such as never?
LINE 634: What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat?
LINE 635: Incomplete.
LINE 636: With it an abode of bliss.
LINE 637: Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up in
LINE 638: 4 oz pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P.,
LINE 639: Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and
LINE 640: anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A
LINE 641: plumtree in a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations.
LINE 642: Peatmot. Trumplee. Moutpat. Plamtroo.
LINE 643: Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that
LINE 644: originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably
LINE 645: conduce to success?
LINE 646: His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn
LINE 647: by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be
LINE 648: seated engaged in writing.
LINE 649: What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?
LINE 650: Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark
LINE 651: corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She
LINE 652: sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks.
LINE 653: On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs.
LINE 654: Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He
LINE 655: seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads.
LINE 656: Solitary.
LINE 657: What?
LINE 658: In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's Hotel, Queen's Hotel,
LINE 659: Queen's Hotel. Queen's Ho...
LINE 660: What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?
LINE 661: The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf
LINE 662: Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,
LINE 663: in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered
LINE 664: in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite
LINE 665: liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on
LINE 666: the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17
LINE 667: Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of
LINE 668: having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new
LINE 669: boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence
LINE 670: of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin
LINE 671: aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main
LINE 672: street, Ennis.
LINE 673: Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or
LINE 674: intuition?
LINE 675: Coincidence.
LINE 676: Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?
LINE 677: He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's
LINE 678: words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament
LINE 679: relieved.
LINE 680: Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to
LINE 681: him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The
LINE 682: Parable of the Plums_?
LINE 683: It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by
LINE 684: implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms
LINE 685: (e.g. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_)
LINE 686: composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in
LINE 687: conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of
LINE 688: financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially
LINE 689: collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent
LINE 690: merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or
LINE 691: contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy
LINE 692: or Doctor Dick or Heblon's _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of
LINE 693: certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual
LINE 694: stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of
LINE 695: successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful
LINE 696: achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following
LINE 697: the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday,
LINE 698: 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.
LINE 699: Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other
LINE 700: frequently engaged his mind?
LINE 701: What to do with our wives.
LINE 702: What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?
LINE 703: Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,
LINE 704: nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,
LINE 705: chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the
LINE 706: policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar,
LINE 707: piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope
LINE 708: addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial
LINE 709: activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress
LINE 710: proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine
LINE 711: satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state
LINE 712: inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular
LINE 713: infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive
LINE 714: superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised
LINE 715: respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction
LINE 716: specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.
LINE 717: What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
LINE 718: in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?
LINE 719: In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
LINE 720: with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and
LINE 721: Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals
LINE 722: as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of
LINE 723: a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political
LINE 724: complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating
LINE 725: the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After
LINE 726: completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the
LINE 727: implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the
LINE 728: corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual
LINE 729: polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by
LINE 730: false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_
LINE 731: (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).
LINE 732: What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
LINE 733: such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?
LINE 734: The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all
LINE 735: balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her
LINE 736: proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by
LINE 737: experiment.
LINE 738: How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?
LINE 739: Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a
LINE 740: certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent
LINE 741: knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's
LINE 742: ignorant lapse.
LINE 743: With what success had he attempted direct instruction?
LINE 744: She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest
LINE 745: comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty
LINE 746: remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated
LINE 747: with error.
LINE 748: What system had proved more effective?
LINE 749: Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.
LINE 750: Example?
LINE 751: She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she
LINE 752: disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new
LINE 753: hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.
LINE 754: Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of
LINE 755: postexilic eminence did he adduce?
LINE 756: Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,
LINE 757: author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn
LINE 758: of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn)
LINE 759: there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).
LINE 760: What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth
LINE 761: seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by
LINE 762: Stephen?
LINE 763: That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,
LINE 764: name uncertain.
LINE 765: Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a
LINE 766: selected or rejected race mentioned?
LINE 767: Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),
LINE 768: Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).
LINE 769: What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish
LINE 770: languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts
LINE 771: by guest to host and by host to guest?
LINE 772: By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_
LINE 773: (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).
LINE 774: By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch_ (thy temple
LINE 775: amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).
LINE 776: How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages
LINE 777: made in substantiation of the oral comparison?
LINE 778: By juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior
LINE 779: literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so
LINE 780: manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of
LINE 781: the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish
LINE 782: characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn
LINE 783: wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence
LINE 784: of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as
LINE 785: ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.
LINE 786: Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the
LINE 787: extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?
LINE 788: Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence
LINE 789: and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.
LINE 790: What points of contact existed between these languages and between the
LINE 791: peoples who spoke them?
LINE 792: The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and
LINE 793: servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been
LINE 794: taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the
LINE 795: seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor
LINE 796: of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland:
LINE 797: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical,
LINE 798: homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures
LINE 799: comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and
LINE 800: Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote,
LINE 801: Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival
LINE 802: and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical
LINE 803: rites in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's
LINE 804: tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and
LINE 805: jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the
LINE 806: possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.
LINE 807: What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,
LINE 808: ethnically irreducible consummation?
LINE 809: Kolod balejwaw pnimah
LINE 810: Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.
LINE 811: Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?
LINE 812: In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.
LINE 813: How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?
LINE 814: By a periphrastic version of the general text.
LINE 815: In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?
LINE 816: The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
LINE 817: hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of
LINE 818: modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions
LINE 819: (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).
LINE 820: Did the guest comply with his host's request?
LINE 821: Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.
LINE 822: What was Stephen's auditive sensation?
LINE 823: He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation
LINE 824: of the past.
LINE 825: What was Bloom's visual sensation?
LINE 826: He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a
LINE 827: future.
LINE 828: What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional
LINE 829: quasisensations of concealed identities?
LINE 830: Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by
LINE 831: Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as
LINE 832: leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.
LINE 833: Auditively, Bloom's: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of
LINE 834: catastrophe.
LINE 835: What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with
LINE 836: what exemplars?
LINE 837: In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very
LINE 838: reverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost of
LINE 839: Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish:
LINE 840: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage,
LINE 841: modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian,
LINE 842: Osmond Tearle († 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.
LINE 843: Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a
LINE 844: strange legend on an allied theme?
LINE 845: Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being
LINE 846: secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid
LINE 847: residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream
LINE 848: plus cocoa, having been consumed.
LINE 849: Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.
LINE 850: Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all
LINE 851: Went out for to play ball.
LINE 852: And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
LINE 853: He drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.
LINE 854: And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
LINE 855: He broke the jew's windows all.
LINE 856: [Illustration]
LINE 857: How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?
LINE 858: With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw
LINE 859: the unbroken kitchen window.
LINE 860: Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.
LINE 861: Then out there came the jew's daughter
LINE 862: And she all dressed in green.
LINE 863: "Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,
LINE 864: And play your ball again."
LINE 865: 
LINE 866: I can't come back and I won't come back
LINE 867: Without my schoolfellows all.
LINE 868: For if my master he did hear
LINE 869: He'd make it a sorry ball."
LINE 870: She took him by the lilywhite hand
LINE 871: And led him along the hall
LINE 872: Until she led him to a room
LINE 873: Where none could hear him call.
LINE 874: She took a penknife out of her pocket
LINE 875: And cut off his little head.
LINE 876: And now he'll play his ball no more
LINE 877: For he lies among the dead.
LINE 878: [Illustration]
LINE 879: How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?
LINE 880: With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's
LINE 881: daughter, all dressed in green.
LINE 882: Condense Stephen's commentary.
LINE 883: One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by
LINE 884: inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when
LINE 885: he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of
LINE 886: hope and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange
LINE 887: habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable,
LINE 888: immolates him, consenting.
LINE 889: Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?
LINE 890: He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him
LINE 891: should by him not be told.
LINE 892: Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?
LINE 893: In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.
LINE 894: Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?
LINE 895: He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
LINE 896: incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
LINE 897: propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of
LINE 898: opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
LINE 899: atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,
LINE 900: hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.
LINE 901: From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
LINE 902: totally immune?
LINE 903: From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
LINE 904: sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an
LINE 905: indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From
LINE 906: somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled
LINE 907: in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its
LINE 908: destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,
LINE 909: sleeping.
LINE 910: Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
LINE 911: of his family?
LINE 912: Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
LINE 913: (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an
LINE 914: exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two
LINE 915: figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.
LINE 916: What other infantile memories had he of her?
LINE 917: 15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and
LINE 918: lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks
LINE 919: her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,
LINE 920: tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,
LINE 921: she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,
LINE 922: Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British
LINE 923: navy.
LINE 924: What endemic characteristics were present?
LINE 925: Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line
LINE 926: of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant
LINE 927: intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.
LINE 928: What memories had he of her adolescence?
LINE 929: She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's
LINE 930: lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to
LINE 931: make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On
LINE 932: the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an
LINE 933: individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and
LINE 934: turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the
LINE 935: 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county
LINE 936: Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year
LINE 937: not stated).
LINE 938: Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?
LINE 939: Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.
LINE 940: What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,
LINE 941: if differently?
LINE 942: A temporary departure of his cat.
LINE 943: Why similarly, why differently?
LINE 944: Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male
LINE 945: (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently,
LINE 946: because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the
LINE 947: habitation.
LINE 948: In other respects were their differences similar?
LINE 949: In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in
LINE 950: unexpectedness.
LINE 951: As?
LINE 952: Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it
LINE 953: for her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake
LINE 954: in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented
LINE 955: spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the
LINE 956: constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf
LINE 957: mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants,
LINE 958: issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a
LINE 959: plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she
LINE 960: dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a
LINE 961: horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a
LINE 962: tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf
LINE 963: hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct
LINE 964: of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.
LINE 965: In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as
LINE 966: matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?
LINE 967: As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
LINE 968: animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of
LINE 969: vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the
LINE 970: pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation
LINE 971: in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of
LINE 972: clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of
LINE 973: the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and
LINE 974: the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination,
LINE 975: _videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical
LINE 976: progression.
LINE 977: In what manners did she reciprocate?
LINE 978: She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to
LINE 979: him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.
LINE 980: She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had
LINE 981: been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his
LINE 982: necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural
LINE 983: phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the
LINE 984: immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of
LINE 985: his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.
LINE 986: What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist,
LINE 987: make to Stephen, noctambulist?
LINE 988: To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
LINE 989: Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
LINE 990: above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of
LINE 991: his host and hostess.
LINE 992: What various advantages would or might have resulted from a
LINE 993: prolongation of such an extemporisation?
LINE 994: For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the
LINE 995: host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the
LINE 996: hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian
LINE 997: pronunciation.
LINE 998: Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
LINE 999: hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
LINE 1000: eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's
LINE 1001: daughter?
LINE 1002: Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother
LINE 1003: through daughter.
LINE 1004: To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest
LINE 1005: return a monosyllabic negative answer?
LINE 1006: If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at
LINE 1007: Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.
LINE 1008: What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the
LINE 1009: host?
LINE 1010: A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment
LINE 1011: of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the
LINE 1012: anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).
LINE 1013: Was the proposal of asylum accepted?
LINE 1014: Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.
LINE 1015: What exchange of money took place between host and guest?
LINE 1016: The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£
LINE 1017: 1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to
LINE 1018: the former.
LINE 1019: What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
LINE 1020: declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?
LINE 1021: To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the
LINE 1022: residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal
LINE 1023: instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a
LINE 1024: series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,
LINE 1025: places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident
LINE 1026: in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street
LINE 1027: (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10
LINE 1028: Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles
LINE 1029: street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a
LINE 1030: conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection
LINE 1031: of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were
LINE 1032: resident in different places).
LINE 1033: What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually
LINE 1034: selfexcluding propositions?
LINE 1035: The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
LINE 1036: Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive
LINE 1037: particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring
LINE 1038: to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had
LINE 1039: publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his
LINE 1040: (the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the
LINE 1041: summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches
LINE 1042: on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and
LINE 1043: received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand
LINE 1044: Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,
LINE 1045: circuitous or direct, return.
LINE 1046: Was the clown Bloom's son?
LINE 1047: No.
LINE 1048: Had Bloom's coin returned?
LINE 1049: Never.
LINE 1050: Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?
LINE 1051: Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
LINE 1052: amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
LINE 1053: international animosity.
LINE 1054: He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible,
LINE 1055: eliminating these conditions?
LINE 1056: There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
LINE 1057: from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
LINE 1058: destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
LINE 1059: the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
LINE 1060: death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
LINE 1061: females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
LINE 1062: accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
LINE 1063: and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
LINE 1064: criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
LINE 1065: terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres
LINE 1066: of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital
LINE 1067: growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through
LINE 1068: maturity to decay.
LINE 1069: Why did he desist from speculation?
LINE 1070: Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
LINE 1071: more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena
LINE 1072: to be removed.
LINE 1073: Did Stephen participate in his dejection?
LINE 1074: He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
LINE 1075: syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational
LINE 1076: reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon
LINE 1077: the incertitude of the void.
LINE 1078: Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?
LINE 1079: Not verbally. Substantially.
LINE 1080: What comforted his misapprehension?
LINE 1081: That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from
LINE 1082: the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.
LINE 1083: In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the
LINE 1084: exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation
LINE 1085: effected?
LINE 1086: Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
LINE 1087: BLOOM
LINE 1088: Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
LINE 1089: STEPHEN
LINE 1090: With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?
LINE 1091: The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de
LINE 1092: populo barbaro_.
LINE 1093: What did each do at the door of egress?
LINE 1094: Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his
LINE 1095: head.
LINE 1096: For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?
LINE 1097: For a cat.
LINE 1098: What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the
LINE 1099: guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from
LINE 1100: the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?
LINE 1101: The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.
LINE 1102: With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his
LINE 1103: companion of various constellations?
LINE 1104: Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
LINE 1105: incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
LINE 1106: scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
LINE 1107: observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
LINE 1108: ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of
LINE 1109: Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles)
LINE 1110: distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of
LINE 1111: Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and
LINE 1112: sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could
LINE 1113: be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in
LINE 1114: 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of
LINE 1115: the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality
LINE 1116: evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote
LINE 1117: futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of
LINE 1118: allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.
LINE 1119: Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?
LINE 1120: Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of
LINE 1121: the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences
LINE 1122: concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives
LINE 1123: and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the
LINE 1124: incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible
LINE 1125: molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single
LINE 1126: pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white
LINE 1127: bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other
LINE 1128: bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies
LINE 1129: of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component
LINE 1130: bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division
LINE 1131: till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never
LINE 1132: reached.
LINE 1133: Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?
LINE 1134: Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of
LINE 1135: the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a
LINE 1136: number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such
LINE 1137: magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power
LINE 1138: of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes
LINE 1139: of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would
LINE 1140: have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its
LINE 1141: printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of
LINE 1142: thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds
LINE 1143: of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of
LINE 1144: every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to
LINE 1145: the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.
LINE 1146: Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their
LINE 1147: satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and
LINE 1148: moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?
LINE 1149: Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,
LINE 1150: normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when
LINE 1151: elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere
LINE 1152: suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the
LINE 1153: line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was
LINE 1154: approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,
LINE 1155: when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a
LINE 1156: working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more
LINE 1157: adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might
LINE 1158: subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,
LINE 1159: Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an
LINE 1160: apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite
LINE 1161: differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would
LINE 1162: probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to
LINE 1163: vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.
LINE 1164: And the problem of possible redemption?
LINE 1165: The minor was proved by the major.
LINE 1166: Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?
LINE 1167: The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,
LINE 1168: yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:
LINE 1169: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:
LINE 1170: the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular
LINE 1171: cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the
LINE 1172: interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous
LINE 1173: discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,
LINE 1174: Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of
LINE 1175: distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite
LINE 1176: compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive
LINE 1177: and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin
LINE 1178: of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the
LINE 1179: birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric
LINE 1180: showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10
LINE 1181: August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon
LINE 1182: in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the
LINE 1183: appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating
LINE 1184: by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and
LINE 1185: amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the
LINE 1186: period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent
LINE 1187: neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude)
LINE 1188: of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and
LINE 1189: disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about
LINE 1190: the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of
LINE 1191: (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably)
LINE 1192: appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about
LINE 1193: the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the
LINE 1194: constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph
LINE 1195: Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before
LINE 1196: or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena
LINE 1197: of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of
LINE 1198: wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of
LINE 1199: nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light,
LINE 1200: obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.
LINE 1201: His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and
LINE 1202: allowing for possible error?
LINE 1203: That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not
LINE 1204: a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the
LINE 1205: known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
LINE 1206: suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and
LINE 1207: of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in
LINE 1208: space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as
LINE 1209: a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present
LINE 1210: existence.
LINE 1211: Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?
LINE 1212: Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
LINE 1213: delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection
LINE 1214: invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the
LINE 1215: satellite of their planet.
LINE 1216: Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
LINE 1217: influences upon sublunary disasters?
LINE 1218: It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the
LINE 1219: nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to
LINE 1220: verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the
LINE 1221: sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.
LINE 1222: What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
LINE 1223: woman?
LINE 1224: Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian
LINE 1225: generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her
LINE 1226: luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and
LINE 1227: setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
LINE 1228: invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to
LINE 1229: inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent
LINE 1230: waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to
LINE 1231: render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil
LINE 1232: inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
LINE 1233: implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:
LINE 1234: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the
LINE 1235: admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,
LINE 1236: when visible: her attraction, when invisible.
LINE 1237: What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's,
LINE 1238: gaze?
LINE 1239: In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a
LINE 1240: paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller
LINE 1241: blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and
LINE 1242: revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.
LINE 1243: How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his
LINE 1244: wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?
LINE 1245: With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued
LINE 1246: affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with
LINE 1247: suggestion.
LINE 1248: Both then were silent?
LINE 1249: Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal
LINE 1250: flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.
LINE 1251: Were they indefinitely inactive?
LINE 1252: At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen,
LINE 1253: then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs
LINE 1254: of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual
LINE 1255: circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to
LINE 1256: the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.
LINE 1257: Similarly?
LINE 1258: The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations
LINE 1259: were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form
LINE 1260: of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate
LINE 1261: year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of
LINE 1262: greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the
LINE 1263: institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the
LINE 1264: ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic
LINE 1265: consumption an insistent vesical pressure.
LINE 1266: What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the
LINE 1267: invisible audible collateral organ of the other?
LINE 1268: To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,
LINE 1269: reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.
LINE 1270: To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus
LINE 1271: circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain
LINE 1272: from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine
LINE 1273: prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
LINE 1274: church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of
LINE 1275: the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine
LINE 1276: excrescences as hair and toenails.
LINE 1277: What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?
LINE 1278: A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament
LINE 1279: from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the
LINE 1280: Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.
LINE 1281: How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal
LINE 1282: departer?
LINE 1283: By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an
LINE 1284: unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and
LINE 1285: turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its
LINE 1286: staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and
LINE 1287: revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.
LINE 1288: How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?
LINE 1289: Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its
LINE 1290: base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and
LINE 1291: forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.
LINE 1292: What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of
LINE 1293: their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?
LINE 1294: The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the
LINE 1295: bells in the church of Saint George.
LINE 1296: What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?
LINE 1297: By Stephen:
LINE 1298: Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.
LINE 1299: Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.
LINE 1300: By Bloom:
LINE 1301: Heigho, heigho,
LINE 1302: Heigho, heigho.
LINE 1303: Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day
LINE 1304: at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south
LINE 1305: to Glasnevin in the north?
LINE 1306: Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in
LINE 1307: bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed),
LINE 1308: John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in
LINE 1309: bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).
LINE 1310: Alone, what did Bloom hear?
LINE 1311: The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth,
LINE 1312: the double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.
LINE 1313: Alone, what did Bloom feel?
LINE 1314: The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing
LINE 1315: point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the
LINE 1316: incipient intimations of proximate dawn.
LINE 1317: Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind
LINE 1318: him?
LINE 1319: Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy
LINE 1320: Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,
LINE 1321: Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin
LINE 1322: Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart
LINE 1323: (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy,
LINE 1324: Sandymount).
LINE 1325: What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?
LINE 1326: The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the
LINE 1327: apparition of a new solar disk.
LINE 1328: Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?
LINE 1329: Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house
LINE 1330: of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of
LINE 1331: the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the
LINE 1332: direction of Mizrach, the east.
LINE 1333: He remembered the initial paraphenomena?
LINE 1334: More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at
LINE 1335: various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,
LINE 1336: the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the
LINE 1337: first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.
LINE 1338: Did he remain?
LINE 1339: With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering
LINE 1340: the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed
LINE 1341: the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front
LINE 1342: room, hallfloor, and reentered.
LINE 1343: What suddenly arrested his ingress?
LINE 1344: The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
LINE 1345: contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible
LINE 1346: fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in
LINE 1347: consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.
LINE 1348: Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of
LINE 1349: furniture.
LINE 1350: A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
LINE 1351: the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an
LINE 1352: alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and
LINE 1353: white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
LINE 1354: door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
LINE 1355: (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had
LINE 1356: been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
LINE 1357: more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
LINE 1358: from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
LINE 1359: occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.
LINE 1360: Describe them.
LINE 1361: One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back
LINE 1362: slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an
LINE 1363: irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply
LINE 1364: upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing
LINE 1365: discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane
LINE 1366: curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat
LINE 1367: and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a
LINE 1368: bright circle of white plaited rush.
LINE 1369: What significances attached to these two chairs?
LINE 1370: Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of
LINE 1371: circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.
LINE 1372: What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?
LINE 1373: A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin
LINE 1374: supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray
LINE 1375: containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two
LINE 1376: discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in
LINE 1377: the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love's Old Sweet Song_
LINE 1378: (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam
LINE 1379: Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications
LINE 1380: _ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,
LINE 1381: close.
LINE 1382: With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?
LINE 1383: With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right
LINE 1384: temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a
LINE 1385: large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,
LINE 1386: bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
LINE 1387: remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the
LINE 1388: gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent
LINE 1389: act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the
LINE 1390: consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual
LINE 1391: discolouration.
LINE 1392: His next proceeding?
LINE 1393: From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black
LINE 1394: diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on
LINE 1395: a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the
LINE 1396: mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
LINE 1397: (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it
LINE 1398: superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
LINE 1399: candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
LINE 1400: latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin
LINE 1401: of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to
LINE 1402: facilitate total combustion.
LINE 1403: What followed this operation?
LINE 1404: The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
LINE 1405: vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.
LINE 1406: What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
LINE 1407: mantelpiece?
LINE 1408: A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46
LINE 1409: a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf
LINE 1410: tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial
LINE 1411: gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
LINE 1412: Alderman John Hooper.
LINE 1413: What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
LINE 1414: Bloom?
LINE 1415: In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
LINE 1416: dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the
LINE 1417: mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear
LINE 1418: melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom
LINE 1419: while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated
LINE 1420: gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.
LINE 1421: What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
LINE 1422: attention?
LINE 1423: The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.
LINE 1424: Why solitary (ipsorelative)?
LINE 1425: Brothers and sisters had he none.
LINE 1426: Yet that man's father was his grandfather's son.
LINE 1427: Why mutable (aliorelative)?
LINE 1428: From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.
LINE 1429: From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
LINE 1430: procreator.
LINE 1431: What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?
LINE 1432: The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
LINE 1433: and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles
LINE 1434: on the two bookshelves opposite.
LINE 1435: Catalogue these books.

LINE 1484: What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of
LINE 1485: the inverted volumes?
LINE 1486: The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its
LINE 1487: place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females:
LINE 1488: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella

LINE 1496: decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).
LINE 1497: Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?
LINE 1498: Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an

LINE 1500: consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of
LINE 1501: the military engagement, Plevna.
LINE 1502: What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?
LINE 1503: The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
LINE 1504: statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus
LINE 1505: purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.
LINE 1506: What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?
LINE 1507: Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two
LINE 1508: articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and
LINE 1509: inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.
LINE 1510: How was the irritation allayed?
LINE 1511: He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible
LINE 1512: stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He
LINE 1513: unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers,
LINE 1514: shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black
LINE 1515: hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over
LINE 1516: the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the
LINE 1517: medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral
LINE 1518: vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in
LINE 1519: circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the
LINE 1520: summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of
LINE 1521: six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one
LINE 1522: incomplete.
LINE 1523: What involuntary actions followed?
LINE 1524: He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice
LINE 1525: in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a

LINE 1527: He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of
LINE 1528: prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly
LINE 1529: abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of
LINE 1530: his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),
LINE 1531: placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the
LINE 1532: interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

LINE 1566: Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended
LINE 1567: his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and
LINE 1568: salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking
LINE 1569: repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded
LINE 1570: the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his
LINE 1571: two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right
LINE 1572: sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again
LINE 1573: effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic
LINE 1574: sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right
LINE 1575: foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently
LINE 1576: lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part

LINE 2000: face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.

LINE 2064: than nothing.

LINE 2073: arrest.
LINE 2074: What considerations rendered departure not irrational?
LINE 2075: The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which
LINE 2076: being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if

LINE 2128: planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of
LINE 2129: space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere
LINE 2130: imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey
LINE 2131: the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of
LINE 2132: the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the
LINE 2133: constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of
LINE 2134: peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on
LINE 2135: malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial

LINE 2140: reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible
LINE 2141: time.
LINE 2142: What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?
LINE 2143: The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of
LINE 2144: the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,
LINE 2145: rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the
LINE 2146: proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of
LINE 2147: warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and

LINE 2173: medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and
LINE 2174: from the cabman's shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).

LINE 2226: He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining
LINE 2227: articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the

LINE 2229: proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to
LINE 2230: the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the
LINE 2231: bed.
LINE 2232: How?
LINE 2233: With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or
LINE 2234: not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress
LINE 2235: being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous
LINE 2236: under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of
LINE 2237: lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of
LINE 2238: conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of
LINE 2239: marriage, of sleep and of death.
LINE 2240: What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?
LINE 2241: New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,
LINE 2242: female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,
LINE 2243: some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.
LINE 2244: If he had smiled why would he have smiled?
LINE 2245: To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
LINE 2246: enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if
LINE 2247: the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,
LINE 2248: last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor
LINE 2249: alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.
LINE 2250: What preceding series?
LINE 2251: Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell
LINE 2252: d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father
LINE 2253: Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show,
LINE 2254: Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of
LINE 2255: Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an

LINE 2257: Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman
LINE 2258: John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a
LINE 2259: bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so
LINE 2260: each and so on to no last term.
LINE 2261: What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and
LINE 2262: late occupant of the bed?
LINE 2263: Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a
LINE 2264: billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a
LINE 2265: boaster).
LINE 2266: Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal
LINE 2267: proportion and commercial ability?
LINE 2268: Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding
LINE 2269: members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
LINE 2270: transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with
LINE 2271: desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene
LINE 2272: comprehension and apprehension.
LINE 2273: With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
LINE 2274: affected?
LINE 2275: Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.
LINE 2276: Envy?
LINE 2277: Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
LINE 2278: superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
LINE 2279: piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of
LINE 2280: a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental
LINE 2281: female organism, passive but not obtuse.
LINE 2282: Jealousy?
LINE 2283: Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately
LINE 2284: the agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between
LINE 2285: agent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion
LINE 2286: of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial
LINE 2287: reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of
LINE 2288: attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.
LINE 2289: Abnegation?
LINE 2290: In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
LINE 2291: establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden
LINE 2292: Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and
LINE 2293: reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of
LINE 2294: ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)
LINE 2295: extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial
LINE 2296: prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current
LINE 2297: expenses, net proceeds divided.
LINE 2298: Equanimity?
LINE 2299: As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
LINE 2300: understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in
LINE 2301: accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar
LINE 2302: similarity. As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the
LINE 2303: planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less
LINE 2304: reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and
LINE 2305: animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement,
LINE 2306: misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,
